I am not an election lawyer but I am an attorney who frequently appears in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  Last year, I tried a case to verdict in front of [Judge  Joanna Seybert](https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-joanna-seybert), the District Court Judge who ruled on the Temporary Restraining Order (""TRO"") plaintiffs in *Campanello v. New York State Board of Elections* (that's the proper name of the lawsuit OP is describing) sought.

As you can see from the linked order by Judge Seybert, the marking is ""TRO application denied.""  That means none of the initial relief sought by the plaintiffs was granted. That means the situation continues as if the lawsuit was never filed.

http://ia601508.us.archive.org/6/items/gov.uscourts.nyed.384188/gov.uscourts.nyed.384188.7.0.pdf

New York always allowed a person claiming to have been the subject of a clerical error removing them from the voting rolls or changing their party without their consent to file a provisional ballot with an affidavit.  *See* [New York Election Law ยง 8-302(e)(ii)](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/election-law/eln-sect-8-302.html#sthash.g9C5WBBR.dpuf):

&gt;(e) Whenever a voter presents himself or herself and offers to cast a ballot, and he or she claims to live in the election district in which he or she seeks to vote but no registration poll record can be found for him or her in the poll ledger or his or her name does not appear on the computer generated registration list or his or her signature does not appear next to his or her name on such computer generated registration list or his or her registration poll record or the computer generated registration list does not show him or her to be enrolled in the party in which he or she claims to be enrolled, a poll clerk or election inspector shall consult a map, street finder or other description of all of the polling places and election districts within the political subdivision in which said election district is located and if necessary, contact the board of elections to obtain the relevant information and advise the voter of the correct polling place and election district for the residence address provided by the voter to such poll clerk or election inspector.  Thereafter, such voter shall be permitted to vote in said election district only as hereinafter provided:

***

&gt;(ii) He or she may swear to and subscribe an affidavit stating that he or she has duly registered to vote, the address in such election district from which he or she registered, that he or she remains a duly qualified voter in such election district, that his or her registration poll record appears to be lost or misplaced or that his or her name and/or his or her signature was omitted from the computer generated registration list or that he or she has moved within the county or city since he or she last registered, the address from which he or she was previously registered and the address at which he or she currently resides, and at a primary election, the party in which he or she is enrolled.  The inspectors of election shall offer such an affidavit to each such voter whose residence address is in such election district.  Each such affidavit shall be in a form prescribed by the state board of elections, shall be printed on an envelope of the size and quality used for an absentee ballot envelope, and shall contain an acknowledgment that the affiant understands that any false statement made therein is perjury punishable according to law.  Such form prescribed by the state board of elections shall request information required to register such voter should the county board determine that such voter is not registered and shall constitute an application to register to vote.  The voter's name and the entries required shall then be entered without delay and without further inquiry in the fourth section of the challenge report or in the place provided at the end of the computer generated registration list, with the notation that the voter has executed the affidavit hereinabove prescribed, or, if such person's name appears on the computer generated registration list, the board of elections may provide a place to make such entry next to his or her name on such list.  The voter shall then, without further inquiry, be permitted to vote an affidavit ballot provided for by this chapter.  Such ballot shall thereupon be placed in the envelope containing his or her affidavit, and the envelope sealed and returned to the board of elections in the manner provided by this chapter for protested official ballots, including a statement of the number of such ballots. 

  That was the law on Monday before the lawsuit was filed and it is still the law on Tuesday afternoon after the plaintiffs were completely shut out.

Yes, the lawsuit continues, but that was not the question Judge Seybert was considering at the hearing today and the case was sent back to a different District Court Judge ([Sandra J. Feuerstein](https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-sandra-j-feuerstein)) where the case will proceed on a regular track and, following the filing of an amended complaint, the Boards of Elections of every New York county will move to dismiss.

This was not a ""win"" for Bernie Sanders supporters by any definition of the word and I don't know which is worse, the misleading headline or the redditors so willing to swallow that misleading headline as the truth."
"300","1461105604","Why does this have to be a win for one politician or another? Can't it just be good?"
"301","1461095888","Do you remember the days back when you didn't need a court order to vote? "
"302","1461104115","How is this a win for Bernie Sanders? This is a win for anyone who had their registration changed regardless of what changed it."
"303","1461095244","Wasn't this like, the opposite of what Bernie Supporters wanted, how is this title accurate at all?

It basically means anyone who was purged unintentionally can... more or less go through exactly the same process they would have gone through had the lawsuit never even happened."
"304","1461095081","The lawsuit still stands but the court hearing has been postponed. Reporter is present at the hearing - https://twitter.com/JordanChariton/status/722501669880115201

-

So - if you were ""purged"" (did everything right, but got ""magically"" switched to independent or republican or are not even in the system) you CAN get a court order to still vote. Demand a court order at your polling place. 

If that doesn't work __demand__ a provisional ballot and fill out and sign __the affidavit__. The lawsuit still stands and your vote may still be counted!

If you didn't register in time or change your party affiliation to Dem in time - you can fill out the provisional ballot but __don't fill out the affidavit__. But chances of it being counted are very low so only do it if there is no line behind you."
"305","1461102850","Just as a question. How are delegate allocations determined for a state? 

Is it population or registered party voters?
Would a simple solution not be to make delegate allocations for a coming primaries based on the number of eligible voters? That would encourage open primaries and accurate and up to date voter registration at the state level without these damaging and largely difficult to substantiate claims of systemic bias and restricted access. If a state did that, they would simply be worth less and have their ability to determine the election for candidates that suit their needs diminished."
"306","1461108714","This is a win for Clinton supporters.  A win for Sanders supporters would be letting independents vote.

The long time democrats who had their affiliation switched are statistically Clinton supporters.  "
"307","1461096325","The update is that there is no update. Everything is proceeding as before."
"308","1461095136","The article doesn't appear to support anything in the headline.

Another day on /r/politics I suppose."
"309","1461109710","So to be clear, how is this a win for Bernie Sanders Supporters?

Democratic and Republican voters, who PROPERLY registered to vote, are still able to vote after signing an afadavit stating that to the best of their knowledge it is not their fault they are not on the voter roll.

If the discrepancy is the fault of the state, their vote will be counted.  If not, it won't.

so basically THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PROCESS AND NOTHING CHANGED!  

Why is this even a headline?  Judge affirms process for voters already exists, recommends using that.  How hard is that?"

My posts regarding Politifact bias are all removed by the mods. Here was my latest presented pretty neutrally:

&amp;nbsp;

Many of us use resources like PolitiFact.com to inform our political leanings regarding the various candidates. Obviously these resources are most helpful when they are accurate and unbiased and these resources certainly portray themselves in this light. I like to at least believe that the website is attempting to be fair and unbiased; however, a review of various determinations shows the website to be extremely nit picky regarding various Bernie Sanders statements and very forgiving to several Hillary Clinton statements. What do we know about PolitiFact?
 
PolitiFact is a project of the Tampa Bay Times. Note that the TBT openly endorses Clinton: ""[She] has been battle-tested, and she is better prepared to be president than when she lost to Obama in the 2008 primaries. The fight for the Democratic nomination may last far longer than anticipated, but only Clinton can win in November and is prepared for the nation's highest office. For the Democratic nomination for president, the Tampa Bay Times recommends Hillary Clinton."" [from Editorial: Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination].
 
That the Tampa Bay Times is obviously and admittedly pro-Hillary does not necessarily imply that PolitiFact.com is biased and it is at least reasonable to assume that the platform is maintained with an interest to remain unbiased regardless of the views of those affiliated with the project. With that said, facts speak louder than words. Let's review some PolitiFact outcomes:
 
&amp;nbsp;

Bernie Sanders: ""we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."" additional quote: ""We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation on Earth.""
&amp;nbsp;

-Rated FALSE x2
&amp;nbsp;

-First note that this double whammy (the same basic quote is scored twice) is costing Bernie Sanders two ""false claims"" for the exact same claim stated earlier and repeated later. Under this type of analysis we may as well double dip on Hillary and Trump EVERY SINGLE TIME they restate anything that was scored false/mostly false. A review of Hillary's page does not find repeated statements piggybacking to tank her false/mostly false record (instead, this type of double dipping favors her, providing extra trues)
&amp;nbsp;

-This is even more asinine when you actually read the quote Bernie was scored on in light of the facts and the PolitiFacts analysis. For example, PolitiFact states in part, ""The United States spends more on health care per capita than other countries, but not always twice as much."" (emphasis added).
&amp;nbsp;

-Sanders should be evaluated on what he ACTUALLY SAID, which is that we spend almost twice as much per capita. Any REASONABLE person can see the below data and decide for themselves that **this statement is AT BEST partially true and is certainly NOT FALSE**.
&amp;nbsp;

-Health care per capita 2007 / 2013: 1. USA $7,167 / $8,713 2. Norway $4,579 (63.9%) 3. Switzerland $4,568 (63.7%) $6,325 Average for other developed countries: less than $3,500 (40.2%).
 
&amp;nbsp;

Bernie Sanders: ""I helped write"" the Affordable Care Act.
&amp;nbsp;

-Rated MOSTLY FALSE
&amp;nbsp;

-While he originally supported his own version he wrote a provision worth 11 billion to this bill. how does this not quality as ""helped write""?
&amp;nbsp;

-He did not claim to have written the entire act; at best Politifact seems to base their rating on a supposed inference Bernie made to making a greater contribution than he actually made (rather than rate his actual quote &amp; and judging for themselves whether they consider adding an 11 billion dollar provision to the bill counts as ""helping"").

&amp;nbsp;
 
Bernie Sanders: federal government, not McDonald's or Walmart, is biggest low-wage employer
&amp;nbsp;

-Rated MOSTLY FALSE
&amp;nbsp;

-The quote in its entirety: ""There is no justice in America when the largest low-wage employer is not McDonaldโs; it is not Burger King; it is not Walmart; it is the United States government,""
&amp;nbsp;

-Based on PolitiFact's own findings: Federal Govt employs nearly 2 million low wage earners. McDonald's: 580,485; Walmart: 901,600.
&amp;nbsp;

-**Note that the statement is patently true**; however, PolitiFact then goes out of its way to (1) make a comparison of the total federal government low wage jobs vs the TOTAL COMBINED jobs provided by McDonald's and Walmart and (2) move the ball to point out the the federal government is likely the ""largest vendor of just about every kind of worker -- high, medium, and low-wage workers"" and then uses the above as the basis for providing the rating.
&amp;nbsp;

-PolitiFact goes on to mention that the federal government pays low wage earnings more than the private sector (you would think this is a point in Bernie's favor...)
&amp;nbsp;

-PolitiFact uses statistics of questionable value for analyzing THIS quote for truth: ""90 percent of workers across all levels of government make more than $12 per hour in half of the 50 states"".
 
&amp;nbsp;

Now let's discuss Double Dipping aka let's rate several equivalent Bernie statements false while we rate several different equivalent Hillary statements true:
&amp;nbsp;

Bernie Sanders: ""never said ... a newspaper endorsed us that did not."" &amp; ""Says he was endorsed by the Valley News newspaper""
&amp;nbsp;

-Each is rated FALSE
&amp;nbsp;

-This quote is not actually a quote from him at all and instead is taken from a political ad spoken by a narrator on his behalf (that is to say, at best, he ""endorsed"" the message). If we are going to expand Politifact ratings to include all statements made on behalf of various candidates in all of these political adverts I suggest we include everyone.
&amp;nbsp;

Hillary Clinton: ""Americans havenโt had a raise in 15 years"" &amp; ""Americans havenโt had a raise in 15 years""
-both rated Mostly True
 
&amp;nbsp;

Finally, let's compare the above nit picky-to-find-false vs a plurality of not really ""mostly true"" Hillary Clinton statements: 
&amp;nbsp;

Hillary Clinton: ""Americans havenโt had a raise in 15 years""
&amp;nbsp;

-Rated MOSTLY TRUE
&amp;nbsp;

-First of all this is a sweeping statement that, under the Bernie level scrutiny, would certainly be rated FALSE. However, PolitiFacts notes that ""In January, 2000, the average worker earned $334 a week. By January, 2015, that figure was $341 โ a 2 percent increase.""
&amp;nbsp;

-PolitiFacts instead decides to rate her statement against the fact that the Inflation-adjusted median household income has decreased while earnings have increased a ""modest 2%"".

&amp;nbsp;

Hillary Clinton: ""He voted for what we call the โCharleston loophole.โ (referring to Bernie Sanders)
&amp;nbsp;

-Rated MOSTLY TRUE
&amp;nbsp;

-In NO terms did he ""vote for"" any gun loophole or Charleston loophole and for this statement to be rated Mostly True is mind-boggling.
&amp;nbsp;

-At best Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady bill five times... also note that in November 1993, Sanders voted for an amendment imposing an instant background check, as noted by PolitiFact.
&amp;nbsp;

-**PolitiFact equates a vote against the Brady bill as equivalent to a vote for the Charleston loophole - a GROSS misrepresentation**.

&amp;nbsp;

Hillary Clinton: ""American schools are 'more segregated than they were in the 1960s'""
&amp;nbsp;

-Rated MOSTLY TRUE
&amp;nbsp;

-Sure would appreciate some of that Sanders level nit picky scrutiny here... **the fact is that her statement is only sorta true for specific periods within the 1960s with several caveats** as is admitted by Politifact.
&amp;nbsp;

-PolitiFact rates the statement MOSTLY TRUE in spite of finding: (1) ""Itโs true that segregation for blacks is worse today than it was in 1968, but itโs certainly not worse than 1964 and before""; (2) fewer black students attend [overwhelmingly black] schools now than they did in 1968 (four in 10 versus six in 10), signalling a decline in segregation; (3) a study found ""segregation has been declining since the 1970s, albeit at a slower rate in the past decade.""; and (4) Overall, experts say and the data shows that the United States has taken two steps forward and one step back, but hasnโt quite reverted to pre-Civil Rights levels of segregation.

 &amp;nbsp;

I hope this is helpful regardless of your political leanings. Websites such as PolitiFact.com are portrayed as neutral ""data repositories"" wherein an interested voted can inform themselves on the various statements made by our candidates. The system requires the those controlling the platform are fairly portraying the results. I am going to check back to review any comments, especially those having contrary opinions. I am genuinely interested to see if I am ""off"" on this assessment."

Here's some more things that contributed to the Subprime mortgage crisis.  Hint:  They are because of regulatory government actions in the economy, NOT because of deregulation.

When the Government enacted the Freddie and Fannie Enterprises. The GSEs forced banks to take higher risk loans that they otherwise would have never given.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis#Role_of_Fannie_Mae_and_Freddie_Mac

That combined with using the Federal Reserve, the Government forced artificially lower interest rates that made people borrow from Subprime loans that normally would never have been able to.

&gt; In a free market, lending large amounts of money to low-income, low-credit borrowers with no down payment would quickly prove disastrous. But the Federal Reserve Boardโs inflationary policy of artificially low interest rates made investing in subprime loans extraordinarily profitable. Subprime borrowers who would normally not be able to pay off their expensive houses could do so, thanks to payments that plummeted along with Fed rates. And the inflationary housing boom meant homeowners rarely defaulted; so long as housing prices went up, even the worst-credit borrowers could always sell or refinance.

I say this as someone still bitter about the fact that they gave ""lie of the year"" to ""Republicans want to end Medicare as we know it"" when the Ryan budget they pushed through the House that year did exactly that, and Politifact's complaint was that Democrats exaggerated who it would affect in campaign ads. Basically every other nominee they had that year was more clear-cut, but hey, they'd picked Republican lies for the previous several years. That was when I and many others decided they were themselves still too caught up with maintaining the appearance of being even-handed for a world with gross party asymmetry on truth-telling.

Serious critiques of Politifact are not what's going on here on Reddit though.

EJU filed for an emergency injunctive action for declaratory judgement to open the New York Primary for thousands of voters purged and for voters who had registrations changed without consent.

    For a voter who believes she or he is a registered Democrat or Republican and does not appear in the poll books, Ryan said there is another option.

    โIf for some reason there's a processing error and the person's name does not appear on the book, they can vote by affidavit ballot at the poll site,โ said Ryan.

    Affidavit, or provisional, ballots are paper and are not put through the scanner. But it still gives a person the ability to vote and those votes are counted.

    If a voter experiences a problem at their poll site, State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office has set up a hotline that will be staffed by attorneys in the office's Civil Rights Bureau. That number is 800-771-7755. Complaints can also be submitted through email at civil.rights@ag.ny.gov at any time between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Tuesday.

So if you want to engage in some protest of civil disobedience, go ahead and do it. Just be aware you're breaking the law by signing that affidavit. And if you were purged from the Democratic registration list, sign that affidavit with confidence! It's for specifically for your use. 

One of the lessons this primary season is know your state's rules. A lot of them are finicky and institutionally a device of suppression. But a lot of them like closed primaries are legal even if they are arguably a means to suppress independents.

The main points are:

Pollworkers are required to show you a ""notice to voters."" This document tells you that you have two options: affidavit ballot or court order. IT IS MY OPINION THAT YOU SEEK A COURT ORDER. Is this going to be extra work? Yes. If you're unsure about your voter status, give yourself plenty of time to vote [...]

If you seek a court order, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET WITH THE LOCAL STATE SUPREME COURT JUDGE ON CALL, and the Board of Elections. MANY OF THESE JUDGES ARE VERY LIBERAL IN THEIR RULINGS, often side with the voter. You will then be issued a document that you can bring to the polling place that allows you to cast your ballot INTO THE MACHINE.

If you choose the option to vote by affidavit ballot, you will be directed to a station within the polling place dedicated to this process. You will then be required to fill out what is essentially a registration form. TAKE YOUR TIME FILLING THIS OUT. It will be scrutinized by Election commissioners of both parties after the election. Your registration and party enrollment will be checked, and voted on by each commissioner to determine if the envelope should be opened and ballot counted.

AVOID voting by AFFIDAVIT BALLOT, unless you have no other option. Chances are good that affidavit ballots will not be counted. "

"629","1461073375","Why aren't they doing these in off years?

There is just no excuse for this."

If they are unable to find your registration call this number 1.866.868.3692 (1.866.VOTE-NYC) and have them confirm polling location and which book you are listed in and in many cases that will resolve the issue so you can cast another ballot. You may have to go to another polling location if you are at the incorrect one. Only accept an affidavit ballot as a last resort, but do everything you can to get a regular ballot!

Do NOT give up!

As well as the affadavit ballot, there are court orders available: http://i.imgur.com/nqA5aie.png  Neither should be used by people who know they didn't register/switch affiliation in time. These options are for people who believe the registration/affiliation has been altered without their consent. For the court order vs. affidavit I think people should call the hotline if they are refused but it comes down to a timing thing really.  If they can get the court order, that's better since they KNOW their vote will be counted since its on the machines.  If they cant do that, then at least vote provisional/affidavit so there is a chance it could be used. So, court order if possible, affadavit otherwise.

If you absolutely can not make a vote the standard way, DEMAND court or affidavit ballot."

&gt; Muhammad Yunus (Bengali: เฆฎเงเฆนเฆพเฆฎเงเฆฎเฆฆ เฆเฆเฆจเงเฆธ; born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, economist and civil society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ""for their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below"". The Norwegian Nobel Committee noted that ""lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty"" and that ""across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development"". Yunus has received several other national and international honours. He received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.

http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/yunus-facts.html

&gt; Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 for their work to ""create economic and social development from below"". Grameen Bank's objective since its establishment in 1983 has been to grant poor people small loans on easy terms - so-called micro-credit - and Yunus was the bank's founder.

&gt; In 1972, following studies in Bangladesh and the USA, Yunus was appointed professor of economics at the University of Chittagong. When Bangladesh suffered a famine in 1974, he felt that he had to do something more for the poor beyond simply teaching. He decided to give long-term loans to people who wanted to start their own small enterprises. This initiative was extended on a larger scale through Grameen Bank.

&gt; According to Yunus, poverty means being deprived of all human value. He regards micro-credit both as a human right and as an effective means of emerging from poverty: Lend the poor money in amounts which suit them, teach them a few basic financial principles, and they generally manage on their own, Yunus claims.

&gt;*Update: Ironically, one of the very first memoranda Barack Obama wrote as president was about the Freedom of Information Act, and contained language very similar to Judge Sweeney's. ""The Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears."" (Hat-tip to analyst Josh Rosner for pointing this out.)

What exactly does the presidency do to you?"
"828","1461083686","Matt Taibbi is fantastic.

What a world, where a gonzo writer for Rolling Stone is close to the only person bothering to investigate the mess that is our financial sector.

&gt; The Obama administration invoked executive privilege, attorney-client and deliberative process over these documents and insisted that their release would negatively impact global financial markets. But in finally unsealing some of these materials last week, a federal judge named Margaret Sweeney said the government's sole motivation was avoiding embarrassment.

&gt;""Instead of harm to the Nation resulting from disclosure, the only 'harm' presented is the potential for criticism,"" Sweeney wrote. ""The court will not condone the misuse of a protective order as a shield to insulate public officials from criticism in the way they execute their public duties.""

You all but embraced President Bush's policies.. ie - NSA and surveillance of the American people, and many other things. 
The ACA I was all for, but it has turned into a disaster. The doctor's and insurance companies are making a killing off of us and yet we are being forced to accept this farce of healthcare. Oh and by the way, I was one of the ones who couldn't afford the insurance, hell, I can't even afford my 30% after my deductible and what happens to me now? Not only do I not have health insurance, but I owe the IRS somewhere around $2,000 to $3,000 dollars!! How the heck am I ever going to pay that? Let's not forget with interest and penalties. 
The ACA needs to be different, I guess I could've tried for Medicaid, I don't think I would've qualified and besides that is not how I was brought up. I don't depend on the government for assistance, never have, never will. Unless the IRS wants to forgive me for not having health insurance and maybe give me a pass on that. I will take that one. "

~~I'd also be interested to see where the DNC approached the Sanders campaign regarding joint fundraising activities or where the Sanders campaign refused such offers.~~ It seems supremely fucked up that while the DNC is supposed to remain impartial it is somehow allowed to start an effort literally named after one of the candidates and use the majority of the funds it receives in order to support that candidate.

[It was offered to the Sanders campaign:](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/18/sanders-campaign-accuses-clinton-fund-of-apparent-violations/)

Changes nothing about the DNC funneling from the HVF back to HFA and then claiming they're raising money downticket. That's a straight up lie when the majority of it does *not* go downticket. Going even further by trying to attack Sanders for not wanting to take money that is essentially laundered is just shameless and incredibly inappropriate given his genuine beliefs on this issue.

[Honduras Presidential Elections in Dispute as Activists Defy Violence to Back Ousted Leader's Wife
](http://www.democracynow.org/2013/11/25/honduras_presidential_elections_in_dispute_as)
&gt;Both candidates are claiming victory in Hondurasโ disputed presidential election. The race has pitted Xiomara Castro, wife of ousted President Manuel Zelaya, against right-wing candidate Juan Orlando Hernรกndez. According to election officials, with more than half of precincts reporting, Hernรกndez has won 34 percent of the vote, while Castro has 29 percent. Castroโs husband, Manuel Zelaya, was ousted in a U.S.-backed coup in 2009. The campaign has been marred by violent attacks **in a country with the highest homicide rate in the world.** 

&gt;**At least 18 members of Castroโs LIBRE party were murdered in the run-up to the election, more than all other parties combined.** We go to Honduras to speak with Adrienne Pine, an assistant professor of anthropology of American University, and Edwin Espinal, a community organizer who has survived harassment and torture by police. ""This election, I think, for most Hondurans, represents the possible overturning of the coup, finally,"" Pine says.

Problem was not only did she not stop the post-coup government from taking advantage, she did everything she could to legitimize their bogus ""free elections"". 

...the idea that a completely corrupt election would fix anything shows deeply flawed judgment, far from avoiding bloodshed it's only perpetuated it.  

And the idea that a post-coup government could be trusted to run a free and fair election is wildly optimistic and naive."

If this part of what she said is true what else there to talk about. America doesn't get to pick who the President of Honduras is, Honduras does.  If President Zelaya was removed in a legal way it's not a coup, it's Honduras following it's constitutional remedy to remove it's President.

You bet your ass he does, except what we're seeing more and more is that the poorly educated are slowly taking over every part of our society.

"1018","1461100749","Hillary ""dodgy"" quote from the article:

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people, and that triggers a legal necessity. Thereโs no way to get around it.

However, this is the reality:

&gt; As for Clintonโs contention that the reluctance to cut aid boiled down to concern for poor Hondurans, U.S. actions in the wake of coups in countries that have strong ties to America may cast doubt on that claim. As [Max Fisher noted in 2013](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/07/05/u-s-has-spotty-record-on-law-requiring-it-to-cut-aid-after-coups/) when the United States kept the aid flowing to Egypt despite a coup, America has a pretty shaky record of cutting off assistance after an ouster of a democratically elected leader, frequently preferring to preserve aid to U.S. military allies.

That is the lie behind the excuse. The US could have opted to, at the very least, continue humanitarian aid to Honduras, in spite of the coup. The US accepted and aided a farcical ""legal and democratic"" process to have a government installed inline with its foreign policy.

Edit: To add [Max Fisher""s Honduras coup comment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/07/05/u-s-has-spotty-record-on-law-requiring-it-to-cut-aid-after-coups/) (&amp; thanks to /u/Tilligan for the additional links):


&gt; Honduras, 2009: Obama cut some aid, but not at first

&gt; After a military coup ousted President Manuel Zelaya, the Obama administration at first did some rhetorical backflips to avoid calling it a coup and triggering the aid cut-off. After negotiations to reinstate Zelaya failed, the U.S. began reducing aid piece-by-piece in an attempt to pressure the military government to move back toward democracy. This followed the spirit of the law โ tying aid to democracy and using it as a coercive tool to deter coups โ but did not appear to follow its letter.

We are locking out HIGH INFORMATION VOTERS! You know, the ones who do their duties as voters and at the same time welcoming droves of partisan zombies who are blue or red and just check a name so long as they keep the other party out of the White House.

The parties would like the primary voters to be people who are committed to the party and are therefore committed to choosing the best candidate and not trying to pull last minute shenanigans against the party you are opposed to. It's quite unusual for both parties to have competitive primaries this late. Typically one party is done, which means those voters would be free to disrupt the other party by pushing a weaker candidate to the front.

Is it not only me who finds this entire rationality and logical process not only absolutely pitiful but infuriating?  This entire election cycle has been plagued with ""firsts"" and ""huge turnouts"" and issues with the process of voting and yet, here we are in NYC with over 120k people missing from registered lists, we have people with voting locations that have broken machines, volunteers willingly giving false information, and an entire lawsuit trying to open up the primary happening at the same time, while all this is going on we have the same old song and dance from the officials:  ""We'll look into it."".  Well - who else have we heard that from too?

We need a serious reality check in this country.  I honestly thought after going through the Bush election cycles that was gonna be it, but apparently we've been dumbed down, we've been made not to care, we've been disenfranchised, and we simply don't care as a population in whole about voter suppression so that this isn't going to be the time.

"1206","1461108503","I think fewer people are against a speculation tax than against Bernie's implementation.  HRC's for instance, is targeted against FTT.  Bernie's target everyone, and will particularly impact middle class retirement.

You have to make &lt;$50k to get his proposed offset tax credit  ($75k married).

Currently the average mutual fund has a turnover of 130%, meaning they sell/buy 130% of the fund value every year.  These rebalancing and reallocation transactions would all be taxed at the 0.5%. So, in addition to to 0.5% paid when an individual investor pays for purchasing the fund, the fund itself pays taxes on it's own transactions, and as a result a fund managed as they currently are will lose ~0.8% of it's annual yield.  This would compound to hundreds of thousands less in the account at time of retirement for someone in their 20s.

Now obviously mutual fund managers will decrease their turnover in response to the new tax, so the effect on yield won't be as great as described above, but it is flat-out wrong to say that the only effect of the tax will be when someone first buys a mutual fund share.  I know you've said it for stock, but current regulations make it very difficult for an individual to maintain their own private stock shares in a 401k rather than buying mutual funds through a financial managing firm.  Even index funds, the least actively managed type of fund,  buy/sell regularly to rebalance their asset pool to keep in line with current indexing.

It's interesting to note that an earlier [2013 FTT bill of Sander's](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1782/text) meant for healthcare funding includes an exemption for retirement accounts  specifically excluded retirement accounts.

&gt;โ(2) EXCEPTION FOR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, ETC.โNo tax shall be imposed under subsection (a) on any covered transaction with respect to any security which is held in any plan, account, or arrangement described in section 220, 223, 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A, 529, or 530 (including assets held in a segregated asset account described in section 817 as part of any such plan, account, or arrangement).

However, this language was removed from his [2015 FTT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1373/text)  for funding college, making clear his intention that retirement accounts are to be taxed."
"1207","1461108922","If you tax each and every financial transaction the tax rate could drop remarkably low because the sum total of all financial transactions (sales, investments, speculative trading, swaps, etc.) far exceeds the GDP since much of those are not counted as ""product""."

On the one hand, Cruz is absolutely repulsive.  I have a feeling that he'd drive the country to the brink, hold hands with the rest of his born-again faithful, and jump!  Let Jesus sort it out.  I'm sorry, but I'm more in favor of solutions that are formulated in this particular dimension.

On the other hand, Kasich sounds like a less-loony solution.  Except that he's signed like 17 abortion restrictions into law over in Ohio.  I love women too much to subject them to a hammerhead like him, so he's out.

On the other hand, Trump is...well, Trump.  And while I'm not particularly keen on putting ""President"" ahead of his name, he is a bit of a known quantity, and is running against the kind of money that has been poisoning the political process.  Based on that alone, I should vote for him, right?  OK, but I was kind of hoping I could step into the booth to support something more than the default option....

And spare me the lectures about how unrealistic it would be to elect a third-party candidate--in this election year, you have a 74-year-old socialist Jew beating the most recognizable woman in politics and you've got the Republican Party falling apart while its voters are on the brink of nominating someone who has never held an elected office.

They don't want to believe that she could/would send anything to Blumenthal that was classified at any level.  They also want to ignore the fact that Blumenthal had NO security clearance of any kind with regard to the State Department.

Guccifer is most likely here to provide, under oath, testimony that he gained email server access (Blumenthal's and possibly Clinton's), read and downloaded a large number of Clinton/Blumenthal emails that were sensitive in nature, possibly at higher levels of secret.  The writing appears to be on the wall - Clinton aides being deposed and questioned, the IT guy that setup the server, the hacker from Romania that we KNOW got Blumenthal's email account and could potentially have hacked Clinton's.

His testimony will be valid as he is considered a subject matter expert with regard to countering system security and can state to what level the Clinton email server was 'secure' and the likelihood (not conjecture) of potential incursions from various threats around the world."

Black Dems are also older than white Dems since older whites tend to vote Republican. Additionally Sanders had virtually no familiarity to black voters while the Clinton's started out extremely popular with them.

"1418","1461053968","Just throwing some word vomit on Democracy Spring. 

There's been a lot of thoughts I've seen on twitter, primarily from Black Lives Matter and Black liberation activists. While in support of getting money out of politics, they had some pretty valid critiques of the actual event/demonstration itself. And one other note is I'd encourage you to search for the source of those critiques as I think it's important to hear different perspectives. 

1. Coordination with Police/Arrests for the sake of getting arrested: So it's been pretty widely acknowledged by those organizing the event that many of the NGOs involved with the event basically coordinated with the police to assure a basically scripted event. No violence at all, basically people going to a spot and ""getting arrested."" Even before I saw criticism, it seemed really weird. I know Cenk is pretty sarcastic when he talks about getting arrested but when people talk about the number of arrests, it doesn't always come with the context. Especially when you consider that these arrests only end up profiting the police department. They've made around 70,000 dollars so far I think? If they do reach 3,500 arrests that'll be 175,000 dollars.

2. Protest Tourism: There was also a sentiment that the protesting was more of a means of bragging about it then really having a sort of goal. The attention and spreading the message makes sense, but the focus on arrests seems strange. Especially when you juxtapose to protests in Ferguson and Baltimore, and how activists there did not have the same type of arrests and police resistance. It sort of cheapens it all. Obviously there is a larger operation behind this with Wolf PAC and similar groups, but the connection between the two doesn't feel that strong. 

3. Pro-Police Chants/Not many People of Color: This was a pretty big issue for me. Cenk Uygur's tweet about pro police chants and them being part of the 99% really got a lot of people mad. And it sort of links with the seemingly very white group of protesters. Not so say there were none, but from almost every picture I've seen, it seems about 90% white. Seeing pro-police chants also is just really sketch to me. Especially when you consider there was coordination between the NGOs and the police to begin with. When you take the Pro-Police chants into account, it plays into the aspect of not many people of color. Essentially the Negotiated Management + the fertishization of arrests + reinforcement of the ""good protester"", pro police chants + money for cops all were factors that really bothered me. There's a lot more people have said, especially about the DC police that I think is worth reading and listening to."

"1439","1461100787","From the comments section:

&gt;So the Bernies are cheering because they think they've retained some FUTURE right to contest TODAY'S primary.

&gt;They haven't. What they ""won"" was simply standing for just under 79 plaintiffs to advance their complaints by filing deadlines for some future possible argument against ... the NYS BoE, or certain NYS county election boards, or whoever.

&gt;None of this is capable of stopping or delaying the DNC or the NYS Dem party from going ahead with delegate selection and ignoring this lawsuit. It might have some effect on FUTURE NYS federal primaries in FUTURE years, but not in 2016.

&gt;They did KIND of make a precedent: they got standing for close to 70 'types' of voters (assuming those voters actually exist and were telling not just the truth but got their stories correct) to argue the issue about where closed primaries are illegal under the Voting Right Act where the 14th amendment applies, EVEN WHEN they file the case the day before a primary and have the claim expanded on the same day as that primary. That's not ""nothing"", but it's not much to go on. I get the impression the EJUSA group is thrilled with winning ANY 'victory'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; hundreds of voters.....yeah....that'll make a difference Bernie

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; yes...and no doubt the great great majority were appropriately purged

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; HA! No it won't! It's OVER!

&gt; The judge granted them standing to argue in the unspecified FUTURE. It's got nothing at all to do with today's NYS Dem primary now. It's sitting there as a little potential weapon for the EJUSA to use in future, in NYS at least.

&gt; But again: this case didn't involve HRC or Sanders or the DNC or RNC or any government authority or campaign. It simply CAN NOTget ""ugly"" without the involvement of those parties, and they simply are not and can not and will not be involved.

I am already strapped with over 1 MM in taxes, which greatly hinders my ability to create jobs.  
With Bernie's new tax plan, our company's growth will stagnate and I will be forced to pay an exorbitant amount of taxes to fund federal programs that do far less for the overall economic growth of the country than I am able to provide on a local scale.  
I have given serious thought of moving my company to Singapore and renouncing my citizenship should he be elected, so as to continue to grow my company.  
(For reference, Singapore has single digit tax rates for both corporations and individuals. The only way to only be taxed at that rate would be to renounce my citizenship, so as to avoid American taxes.)  
This is the biggest problem that I feel many people do not realize.  
This tax plan will cause many businesses to set up headquarters overseas so as to avoid the insane level of taxes they will be subject to, which will cause far more harm to the economy than good.  
For example, if I chose to move, then that's 40 less jobs that will be in the Central Florida region. The mean income in my company is over 60k, so that's quite a bit of lost income for families that are depending on my company for their existence.

Related to State &amp; Local elections and initiatives &amp; referendums, all of which have an *enormous* effect on national politics - yuuuuuge:  

[**Range and/or Approval voting** is currently the BEST method of voting.](http://rangevoting.org/BayRegsFig.html) Some people like to argue that Instant-Runoff voting is what we should go to, but that is incorrect, wrong, misguided, inaccurate ([1](http://rangevoting.org/IrvExec.html), [2](http://rangevoting.org/TarrIrv.html)). Again, instant-runoff voting is NOT what we want or need. *It's a trap!* I fell into that at one point, believing it to be a strong method of voting, but it is not, when it's all said and done.

With Range and/or Approval voting:

* People can still vote *exactly the same* as Winner-Take-All, if they want to.

* Requires [*no new* voting machines](http://rangevoting.org/VMSumm.html) *or* constitutional amendments (very important).  

* Winner-Take-All voting doesn't give the electorate a chance to be more than binary nutcases, practically. Winner-Take-All voting forces both the people and representatives into black and white (or red and blue), extremist-esque thinking.

* If changing the voting system wouldn't help at all, as some like to argue, then there's no good reason not to advocate for changing it to something that *allows and provides for more expressivity and nuance.* &lt;------ the whole point and reason for having elections, hello? express yoself! treat yoself! quit being robotic! 

* There's no good reason, no reason that doesn't fly in the face of liberty, freedom, and/or representative democracy not to go to something like **Range and/or Approval voting** - two methods that undoubtedly give our better nature's - our better selves - a chance to vote and be represented.

Approval Voting is, *in fact*, used and endorsed by the [Mathematical Association of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting), the American Mathematical Society, and the Institute of Management Sciences (now the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences).

&gt;It may be little exaggeration to say that this last will be to voting as the invention of the zero was to mathematics...

&gt;There are few ways we as individuals can work effectively against the widespread evils of the modern world. Helping to bring about really sound elections could be the most powerful.

We deserve better. We deserve more accurate representation. We are worth it. 

If the United States is going to be a world leader and bastion of real, true, actual democracy we need to SHOW IT and BE IT.

I'm 31 - a millennial through and through. I hated Clinton in 2008, was Obama all the way. But I seem to have taken the total opposite lesson of the past 8 years than the rest of my age cohort.

My age group seems to have seen Obama's promises in 2008, saw they didn't work in the face of GOP opposition, and their response is ""we just need to find someone willing to be even *more* pure and *more* righteous and *more* willing to ignore the reality of entrenched opposition"".

I don't get it. All those things that I hear people say they love about Bernie are almost the exact same things Obama was doing in 2008 (the ""not me, us"" stuff, for example, is basically the exact same line as ""we are the ones we've been waiting for""). There's nothing new under the sun here. But whereas Obama clearly learned his lessons in office, and seems to understand that there actually are conservatives in this country and they don't just disappear because you hope they will, Sanders has evinced no such awareness. And his supporters seem to have the same blinders about what the last 6 years has actually been like.

I've seen no good argument from any Sanders supporters ever as to why Bernie would succeed where Obama failed. The only answer I ever hear is the ""political revolution"", and that Sanders will keep people engaged which, to me, is just utter nonsense.

From my perspective, Sanders is not speaking raw truths. He's just repeating the same pablum we heard 8 years ago and totally ignoring the realities of why they failed the last time around.

Everyone talks about biologically born men using womens bathrooms.  But this case was actually the opposite.  It was a biologically born female that identified as a male and wanted to use the men's room.  No one had a problem with him using the men's bathroom.  It was a non issue with the school staff.  Teachers were happy to accommodate the student's decision.  Everything was fine until the state legislators decided they knew better than the teachers.

Ironically the appeals court went to the dictionary definition of sex.  Which is what the legislators should have done in the first place.

Sex (gender) - the sum of the morphological, physiological, and   behavioral   peculiarities   of   living beings     that     subserves     biparental reproduction  with  its  concomitant  genetic  segregation and recombination which underlie most   evolutionary   change,   that   in   its   
typical  dichotomous  occurrence  is  **usually**  genetically  controlled  and  associated  with  special   sex   chromosomes,   and   that 
is **typically** manifested   as   maleness   and femaleness

Even the dictionary makes it clear that gender is not defined solely by genetics.

Noble agreed. โThey really are throwing their weight behind a particular candidate,โ he said. โTheir argument is usually that it helps the party generally, but the practical and legal reality is that it benefits Hillary Clinton.

The process is convoluted in all sorts of ways that aren't necessarily malicious. I personally don't think this set of elections makes things better and should be scrapped. I would prefer party leadership to directly vote for the party leader as we do in Canada to:
1) prevent disunity in the party - the primaries gut the party from within
2) prevent populist pandering 
3) prevent hijacking a party
4) encourage 3rd party runs instead of vying for one of the two big brands. If it weren't for primaries, I bet the US would have a real 3rd or 4th party
5) similarly to 4), enhanced cooperation in government due to a 3rd party because in a 3 party system, there almost always needs to be cooperation. Prevent an adversarial 2 party system. 
6) save time and money

"
"1736","1461076679","Most people support Clinton.  If you look at either RCP or 538, Sanders has never had has much support as Clinton in the average national poll computed by either one.

Most people vote for Clinton.  Sanders primarily wins small caucus states.    He has only won 5 primaries this entire election season.  Clinton has a significant lead in pledged delegates chosen by the people.

Clinton will certainly be the nominee.  Sanders has not had a realistic chance of winning since SC.

I seems to me that the process is working fine.  There have been some problems.  There always are.  

When I voted in mu caucus in WA, there were lots of problems, an it took way too long.  All the organizers were for Sanders.  We poor Clinton people were swamped.  But it never occurred to me to blame the problems on evil intent by the Sanders people running the process.  Everyone was volunteers just trying to do a good job.  I was pleased just to see so many people out to support their candidate and participate in the process if though we lost.  

But it seems that, too often, the Sanders campaign can't accept that it loses, and is sure that, since it sees itself as the will of the people, if it loses, then the will of the people has been denied and that is corrupt by definition.  So it looks at every little screw up or oddity as signs of evil.  The coin toss tantrums in Ohio were embarrassing.  The cries of foul because of Super Tuesday are scapegoating. 

The fact is that the most undemocratic aspect of the Democratic primary system is the use of caucuses with a high bar to participation.  In WA we have about 3% of the eligible Democrats participate.  Most people are not able to devote 4-5 hours to voting at some randomly fixed time.  This has been a huge boon for Sanders.  As I mentioned, he has only won 5 primaries.  Most of his delegates are from undemocratic caucus victories where he can run up large percentages.  But Clinton supporters have never claimed that this was a sign of evil corruption.   It s just how the system is set up.  Maybe it should be changed, but it was not set up to help Sanders, and we accept that.

The fact is, sometimes you lose.  


edit:  P.S. The complaint about Sander soliciting Super Delegates not that it is clear that he will not win the pledged delegates is not about it being unfair, and are not concerned that it might succeed.   It is about it being hypocritical.  He has been denouncing this very idea as undemocratic.  It is like denouncing Clinton for having a PAC, but has not ruled out using one for the general election if he gets the nomination.    If it is corrupt, it's corrupt.  "

"1748","1461025852","So the Hillary Victory Fund is this:

The DNC, Hillary campaign, and 32 states.

Voter donation limits to individual campaigns are $2700

Limit Donation to a state Democratic Party is: $10000 per state 

Max donation to the DNC is: $33,400 to the dollar.

32 states have a ""stake"" in her victory fund, meaning they are looking for a return on their investment.

What Hillary is doing currently is having people donating $10000 to each state through this victory fund, and $33400 to the DNC. But the issue is, that most of the money is going into this fund for her campaign, but she promises these states and the DNC a senate majority. That is why superdelegates pledged so early on. This is where the problem is. It is laundering money through this fund into her campaign.

Let's calculate this: $10000 x 32 states = $320,000

$320,000 + $33400 max donation to the DNC = WHAT DO YA KNOW?  $353,400.

Think that clooney dinner donation price was a coincidence?

Edit: She bought the loyalty of superdelegates before Bernie even announced his candidacy, and it's said she funneled more than maximum into her campaign as it stands. That's where the issue is. DNC is supposed to be impartial during this time and essentially coronated her before Bernie even had a chance. He had a 350 delegate gap that he had to make up before the first states even voted.

Edit: yes, she bought their loyalty by taking their state money and then awarding them with seats in the house later on, which is what I mean. Bernie has down ballot selections, but they aren't necessarily establishment democrats.


EDIT: So. 

Given that the Hillary Clinton Victory Fund has specifically disclosed that approximately 28.27% of the funds went to Hillary Clinton (9.5/33.6m) while only 16.37% went down ticket (5.5/33.6m).... 

(And DO note that it mostly went to parties and committees!) 

353,400 * 0.2827 = 99,906.18 directly to Hillary Clinton. 

3, 330.21~ for SOME of the state parties. Not candidates. The party. Specifically. 

Now, the individual campaign contributions limit is 2700. 

99,906.18 / 2700 = 37.002288...

Thirty fucking seven times the individual contributions amount. 

This is straight up Bull Shit."

The maximum an individual donor can give to a Joint Fundraising Fund is over $300K. Hillary's Victory Fund (HVF) throws these Joint Fundraising Events. But the most that Hillary For America (HFA), her current campaign fund, can take of each donation is $2,700 per donor. So there is no problem with the HVF in itself. Hilary is not able to circumvent the rules in any substantial way in this fashion.

What Sanders is alleging is that the HVF is indirectly subsidizing the HFA since HVF money is used to send mail/place advertisements which requests money for *both* the HVF and the HFA funds. Using HVF funds to pay for mailers/ads asking for donations for **both** the HFA and HVF is clearly suspect, and I would not be surprised if the FEC issued a decision clarifying the law in this area.

"1767","1461018350","&gt;Yet, even as the candidates lavish love on Brooklyn, a WNYC analysis of state voter enrollment statistics found that the number of active registered Democrats dropped there by 63,558 voters between November 2015 and April 2016. That translates into a 7 percent drop in registered Democrats in the borough. 

&gt;No other borough in New York City nor county in the rest of the state saw such a significant decline in active registered Democrats. In fact, only 7 of the state's 62 counties saw a drop in the number of Democrats. Everywhere else saw the numbers increase.

...

&gt;But even though more than 60,000 people were dropped from the list of active registered Democrats in Brooklyn, there was only an increase of roughly 10,000 inactive voters in the county. That means some 50,000 voters are unaccounted for entirely.

anyone think of any good excuse for this?  because my blood is starting to boil...

**Edit**: u/DrapeRape brought [this graph](https://imgur.com/a/LJ48R) to my attention and linked me to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4fedzj/60000_fewer_democrats_in_brooklyn_and_no_clear/d28deh6) by u/EVJoe.  While I have no idea as to why the numbers fluctuate as they do, it does seem like WNYC should have probably mentioned these fluctuations in their article, and at least respond to them before continuing to pump our conspiratorial intuitions.

**Edit 2**: u/Amaranthine [points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4fedzj/60000_fewer_democrats_in_brooklyn_and_no_clear/d28ir2z) that, while perhaps not impossible, this is a significant drop in registered voters compared to semiannual norms.  So far I don't see any particular evidence of any wrongdoing, these changes are not so distinct from past trends, but this area is really the crux on the issue.  It would be nice if someone familiar with these numbers could explain the official difference between people listed as ""inactive"" vs. people who are no longer counted, and how one falls into either group.

**The Latest**: A new [report from WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/story/de-blasio-demands-explanation-boe-drops-126000-brooklyn-democrats/) has come out with another article (currently on the front page of this subreddit) that claims that the count is not 60,000 fewer Dems, but actually 

&gt;includes 12,000 people who moved out of the borough, 44,000 people who were moved from active to inactive voter status and 70,000 voters removed from the inactive voter list."

"1794","1461075234","60,000 fewer in Brooklyn will be the least of the DNC's worries if they keep shoving Hillary down our throats. Whether you think the DNC has been playing favorites with Hillary or not, the perception that Sanders has been treated unfairly has damaged the image of the DNC with unaffiliated voters. Running a fair and honest election could have help the DNC attract even more unaffiliated voters to their cause, especially with the clowns the GOP put up. Instead the ""democratic"" party seems to be doing all they can to make their private primaries as exclusive as possible. As a former republican and current independent, this election has only strengthened my resolve in refusing to vote for the lesser of two evils. As much as I dont want to see Trump or Cruz in office, I simply cannot support a party who both uses the concept of democracy in their namesake, while at the same time telling people who aren't party of their club to fuck off during the primary, but to vote for them in the general.

I'm not saying they needed to hand the election to Sanders, but the endless fuckery by the Clinton campaign has left me feeling bitter. A fair, impartial election - even if the result is a Clinton victory - would have left me disappointed, but understanding. I still probably would not have voted for her, but my opinion of the DNC would not be diminished. However, the favoritism and now this issue of potential voter suppression in AZ and NY leave me feeling suspicious. With all the claims of registration switching and confusion with dates, the NY democratic party should simply open the election. It may not keep their club exclusive like they want, but ensuring the American people have a voice in choosing their leaders should be more important to a the ""democratic"" party.

One last thought - I see a lot of people claiming close primaries are okay because it is a private organization, and in open primaries republicans could manipulate the vote by voting democratic. As a disenfranchised former republican, do you knkw what that sounds like to me? It sounds like the exact same bullshit logic the republicans were using to justify voter ID. Neither issue is about fraud, or corruption, or ensuring people play fair - it is about controlling the vote and suppressing the will of the American people in favor of the will of the respective party. It is undemocratic and shameful, and anyone pretending that it is acceptable needs to have their head checked.

"1898","1461079867","I think fewer people are against a speculation tax than against Bernie's implementation.  HRC's for instance, is targeted against FTT.  Bernie's target everyone, and will particularly impact middle class retirement.

You have to make &lt;$50k to get his proposed offset tax credit  ($75k married).

Currently the average mutual fund has a turnover of 130%, meaning they sell/buy 130% of the fund value every year.  These rebalancing and reallocation transactions would all be taxed at the 0.5%. So, in addition to to 0.5% paid when an individual investor pays for purchasing the fund, the fund itself pays taxes on it's own transactions, and as a result a fund managed as they currently are will lose ~0.8% of it's annual yield.  This would compound to hundreds of thousands less in the account at time of retirement for someone in their 20s.

Now obviously mutual fund managers will decrease their turnover in response to the new tax, so the effect on yield won't be as great as described above, but it is flat-out wrong to say that the only effect of the tax will be when someone first buys a mutual fund share.  I know you've said it for stock, but current regulations make it very difficult for an individual to maintain their own private stock shares in a 401k rather than buying mutual funds through a financial managing firm.  Even index funds, the least actively managed type of fund,  buy/sell regularly to rebalance their asset pool to keep in line with current indexing.

It's interesting to note that an earlier [2013 FTT bill of Sander's](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1782/text) meant for healthcare funding includes an exemption for retirement accounts  specifically excluded retirement accounts.

&gt;โ(2) EXCEPTION FOR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, ETC.โNo tax shall be imposed under subsection (a) on any covered transaction with respect to any security which is held in any plan, account, or arrangement described in section 220, 223, 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A, 529, or 530 (including assets held in a segregated asset account described in section 817 as part of any such plan, account, or arrangement).

However, this language was removed from his [2015 FTT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1373/text)  for funding college, making clear his intention that retirement accounts are to be taxed."

Sanders proposes a 0.5% transactional tax on equities, that's heinously high.  I'm also confident big investors will come up with clever ways to skirt the definition of investments subject to the tax (edit: or make international plays that accomplish the same type of investment they would have made in the US)

The article writer says that England has had no issues with their transactional tax, he omits the [modern day analog in Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax) that had disastrous consequences.  

Finally, hedging is necessary for commerce.  Although Sanders' plan drops the rate to 0.2% for Futures, some industries are in the Futures market *daily* as a necessity to ""lock in"" prices for commodities their business uses.  Oil, grain, cows, lumber, copper, currencies, etc... if you do business with commodities or currencies, you should be hedging.  That 0.2% now becomes an awful choice for business... do I hedge and pay 0.2% every single time, or do I ride the volatility?  That small tax could very easily translate to mid to high double digit rate if normal hedging activity continues (which it won't, and volatility will sky rocket, and these companies will still be paying hefty fees for the privilege of hedging)."

They're figuring out that they're less likely to get robbed by chain smoking halfwit burger flippers fighting for a minimum wage than by big banks and institutional investors rigging the deck behind the scenes.

In the short term this likely helps Clinton IMO because she is pulling in those disenchanted Republican voters.  In the long term a Clinton presidency will cause serious economic and social problems, possibly another great depression.  So basically the ""Democratic Party"" is fighting what remains of the Republican Party for the nursing home vote.  Whoever gets it wins. Trump is going to drag the big money, genocide supporting Clinton's names so far into the dirt as to make it unrecognizable.  But this is just a show to satiate disenfranchised middle and lower class whites. The powers that be have already decided on Clinton, they probably just didn't figure on Bernie and some Trump supporters figuring all this out from under their stage managed campaigns.  

The policies these people put in will likely result in further alienation of the majority and, as the baby boomers die off and their base erodes, in the disintegration/balkanisation of the US.

___

&gt;I want to let you know about a development that just occurred, because it matters. The tone of this primary matters, and the condition of our party at the end of it will matter as we prepare to face Donald Trump or Ted Cruz this fall.
Earlier today, the Sanders campaign wrote a letter to the Democratic National Committee, falsely accusing us of violating campaign finance law.


&gt;You wonโt be surprised by what happened next: 26 minutes after the letter was sent, his campaign sent a fundraising email attempting to capitalize on the phony charges.


&gt;(Before you read any further, let's get one thing straight: this accusation is false. They're questioning our joint fundraising agreement with the DNC, which allows us to support Democrats running up and down the ticket -- the same fundraising structure used by President Obama in 2008 and 2012.)


&gt;This latest incident is part of a troubling pattern of behavior -- occurring just as Bernieโs mathematical odds of winning the nomination dwindle toward zero -- in which Sanders and his team are not just debating us on issues (which we all agree is perfectly fair), but rather attacking Hillary Clintonโs character, integrity, and motivations.


&gt;The fact that they include the Democratic Party in these charges -- an organization we want future generations of progressives to trust and support -- further confirms that the Sanders campaign has let things get out of hand in its waning days. To wit:
Over the weekend, they had protesters outside one of our fundraising events -- one whose proceeds went not just to Hillary for America, but to the Democratic National Committee and 32 state Democratic Parties -- throwing dollar bills at Hillaryโs motorcade, as if they were at, shall we say, an adult entertainment venue. This was just days after someone introducing Bernie at a rally called Hillary a โDemocratic whore.โ


&gt;In last weekโs debate, Bernie questioned Hillaryโs commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2% of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2%, mind you: 0.2%.
And of course, Sanders spent several days calling Hillary unqualified for the presidency, based on an entirely false claim that Hillary had said the same about him. She hadnโt (and still hasnโt, even after what he said).


&gt;To be clear, we welcome a debate on the important issues facing Americans, like how to prevent gun violence, encourage tolerance, and do more to level the playing field for Americans who are counting on us.


&gt;But itโs hard to see how anyone -- other than Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- benefits from this downward spiral of irresponsible and baseless attacks. Right about now is when we ought to be talking about coming together as a progressive movement, not undermining a generation of votersโ faith in the Democratic Party and in the woman who is almost certain to be its nominee.


&gt;Thank you for everything you do to support our campaign.

"2027","1461023771","So the Hillary Victory Fund is this:

The DNC, Hillary campaign, and 32 states.

Voter donation limits to individual campaigns are $2700

Limit Donation to a state Democratic Party is: $10000 per state 

Max donation to the DNC is: $33,400 to the dollar.

32 states have a ""stake"" in her victory fund, meaning they are looking for a return on their investment. That is why those superdelegates committed so early on.

What Hillary is doing currently is having people donating $10000 to each state through this victory fund, and $33400 to the DNC. But the issue is, that most of the money is going into this fund for her campaign, but she promises these states and the DNC a senate majority. This is where the problem is. It is laundering money through this fund into her campaign.

Let's calculate this: $10000 x 32 states = $320,000

$320,000 + $33400 max donation to the DNC = WHAT DO YA KNOW?  $353,400.

Think that clooney dinner donation price was a coincidence?"
"2028","1461018613","The issue isn't the money it's the fact that she claims she's helping the dos ticket races when in reality a lot of that money seems to be funneled back to her own campaign instead of being spent on state/local elections. "
"2029","1461038897","Remember, this is the same type of fund raising that Obama banned. Here is what he said:

&gt;""We are going to change how Washington works,"" Obama said at the time. **Lobbyists and corporate PACs โwill not fund my party.** They will not run our White House. And they will not drown out the voice of the American people when I'm president of the United States of America.โ
"
"2030","1461008399","&gt;โAt worst, using funds received from large-dollar donors who have already contributed the $2,700 maximum to HFA [Hillary for America] may represent an excessive contribution to HFA from these individuals.โ

If those 28 pages didn't show Saudi involvement, they wouldn't freak out and threaten to sell US treasuries. And yes, they should be held accountable.

In fact, the Bush administration should have frozen all Saudi assets if the report proved Saudi government involvement...even at the risk of losing a key ally in the ME. The reason they didn't is likely because of A) oil and B) the risk of losing a key foothold and staging ground.

So while I totally agree the Saudis should be held accountable, it WILL open a huge can of worms...which imo is necessary and good, but it WILL hurt the economy more than just by Saudi selling treasuries.

We simply look at this as a Saudi bad, US good issue. In reality, the US has done PLENTY of horrible things that would allow foreign citizens to sue the US if sovereign immunity falls away (which it would if they allow that lawsuit against Saudi Arabia). 

**What about the poor people in El Salvador the US infected with STDs as a ""test""? What about the US starting a war over bananas in Honduras simply because Chiquita Banana had influence over the US government?**

Christ, we attacked a whole country under false pretenses and the 2 war criminals (Bush &amp; Cheney) who knew about it still walk free...and yet we expect SA to accept a verdict???

In short, yes, the US could hold Saudi Arabia accountable (and imo should)...but at the same time, brace yourself for a TON of lawsuits against the US. And if we expect Saudi Arabia to accept a verdict, so do we. 

The president is between a rock and a hard place. Sure, allowing the lawsuit would make him popular...for like a a month...before he has to stand in front of US citizens explaining to them why the government now owns billions to people in El Salvador and Honduras among a crapload of other countries the US wronged. 

Any monetary gains made by winning the case against SA would likely be completely wiped out by all those foreign citizens suing the US.

Well, shit.

____

Sidenote: 

&gt; the fact that no other firm failed as a result of Lehmanโs failure demonstrated that these large nonbank firms are not so โinterconnectedโ that the failure of one will drag down others and cause a systemic event.

That's BS.

The other banks didn't fail (aside from Bear Stearns, which I guess we're ignoring because they didn't technically go bankrupt?), but that's because we threw taxpayer money at them. We solved for their ""inter-connectedness"" with the TARP, which stopped a chain reaction of bank collapses.

"2237","1461015245","Two things here stick out to me.  First, that this is just one more way the very rich are able to buy elections.  There is a maximum contribution limit of $2,700 for a reason, and this is just blatant disregard of this law. 

&gt;The letter said the Hillary Victory Fund reported receiving individual contributions as high at $353,400 or more, ""which is over 130 times the $2,700 limit that applies for contributions to Secretary Clinton's campaign.""

Secondly, this is just one more clear sign of favoritism by the DNC towards Hillary.  This is just a major slap in the face to democracy.  What's even the point of voting or caucusing for a candidate in a primary if the committee is just going to set the rules to help other candidates more than yours, fundraise with only select candidates, and have people within the party end up choosing the candidate in the end if it's even somewhat close.  

&gt;โWhile the use of joint fundraising agreements has existed for some time โ it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest,โ said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, in a news release.

"2238","1461016439","I'd say what he's really accusing her of is political money laundering.  Using very liberal interpretations of what can be used to pay for various things in order to use funds from big money donors for the Hillary Victory Fund that can't be directly used on her campaign to generate money from small donors that can be directly used on her campaign.  Inefficient, but the result is clean money out the other side.  Plus it helps pay salaries for people working both."
"2239","1461016067","I usually lean Hillary, but Bernie absolutely has a point here. The maximum an individual donor can give to a Joint Fundraising Fund is over $300K. However, the most that Hillary For America (HFA), her current campaign fund, can take from the Joint Fundraising Events which raise money for the Hillary Victory Fund (HVF) is $2,700 per donor. So there is no problem with the HVF in itself. Hilary is not able to circumvent the rules in any substantial way in this fashion.

What Sanders is alleging is that the HVF is indirectly subsidizing the HFA since HVF money is used to send mail/place advertisements which requests money for *both* the HVF and the HFA funds. Using HVF funds to pay for mailers/ads asking for donations for **both** the HFA and HVF is clearly suspect, and I would not be surprised if the FEC issued a decision clarifying the law in this area. 

Another thing to remember is that Bernie probably took this as a slap in the face, and rightfully so. These Victory Funds are generally not set up until a Candidate is the Nominee or the Presumptive Nominee. "

Hillary for America Campaign Manager Robby Mook released the following statement in response to the latest false attacks from Sanders campaign:
 โThe Sanders campaignโs false attacks have gotten out of hand. As Senator Sanders faces nearly insurmountable odds, he is resorting to baseless accusations of illegal actions and poisoning the well for Democratic candidates up and down the ticket. It is shameful that Senator Sanders has resorted to irresponsible and misleading attacks just to raise money for himself.
Instead of trying to convince the next generation of progressives that the Democratic Party is corrupt, Senator Sanders should stick to the issues and think about what he can do to help the Party he is seeking to lead.
Furthermore, we call on Senator Sanders to end his frivolous and cynical lawsuit against the DNC which continues to drain resources needed to help the Democrats up and down the ticket win in November, and protect the progress weโve made under President Obama.โ

* And this is the ""non-response"" response from the DNC:

&gt; โThe DNC offered to engage in the same joint fundraising efforts with all the major presidential candidates early in the cycle and we welcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties now to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in November.โ

I thought you were only legally allowed to donate $2,700 to a campaign, and then any further donations had to be towards an entity (Super PAC or party committee) that either:

- Pushes that individual campaign but doesn't coordinate with them (like the Priorities USA Super PAC)

- Doesn't push that individual campaign, but pushes values and issues that closely parallel the individual campaign (Like when the Planned Parenthood Action fund sends you a mailer telling you to vote for women's rights, and *implying* a vote for Hillary)

- Doesn't push that individual campaign, but pushes an assortment of other candidates in other races. (Like the DNC or the DCCC)

If what the DNC is doing is legal, doesn't this make a party committee effectively a MegaSuperPac that allows you to donate more than your maximum amount to an entity that's openly coordinating with and pushing **the specific candidate** you already maxed out for?"

The other issue, which holds more water, is that democrats are being switched to unaffiliated without their knowledge/consent. I'm definitely interesed to see if this is true/widespread. The only example provided was the woman who says she unknowingly waived her party affiliation after hurricane sandy when there was an emergency measure to allow people to vote in any precinct. I'd want to see some corroborating stories that this happened to others after hurricane sandy though, and that it was truly ""hidden"" (for some reason?). The only official quoted just says that so far all the cases investigated have been errors on the part of the people registering.

 And finally the article really goes to great lengths to imply this is to intentionally hurt Sanders. But quietly changing the registration of people who've been democrata for years seems more likely to hurt Clinton. Or at least as likely. How would the people purging the affiliations know who that person was going to vote for? Especially if it did occur in 2012 after Sandy.

"2295","1461003998","It appears a lot of people are conflating the right to vote with the right to select a parties nominee in this thread. For those who don't know, they're not the same thing. Parties select their nominee. How democratic they want to be about it is entirely up to them. No where does the Constitution give you the right to vote for a party nominee. It's a perk of being in the club.

That said, I don't necessarily agree with it. Certainly it's better than a nominee selected without voting, but I understand the rationale of limiting it to those who are affiliated. For those complaining about grass-roots/third party/revolutions being squelched by these sort of antics, you are right. Those sorts of uprisings should be difficult and should represent something systemic, something pervasive. It should not be so easy to usurp the will of the people, either enough people will it, or they don't. With the kindling Sanders as laid I'm sure a third party based around his ideals could definitely begin to build real traction at this point.

As Senator Sanders faces nearly insurmountable odds, he is resorting to baseless accusations of illegal actions and poisoning the well for Democratic candidates up and down the ticket. It is shameful that Senator Sanders has resorted to irresponsible and misleading attacks just to raise money for himself.
Instead of trying to convince the next generation of progressives that the Democratic Party is corrupt, Senator Sanders should stick to the issues and think about what he can do to help the Party he is seeking to lead.
Furthermore, we call on Senator Sanders to end his frivolous and cynical lawsuit against the DNC which continues to drain resources needed to help the Democrats up and down the ticket win in November, and protect the progress weโve made under President Obama.โ

"2433","1461106480","Two things:  

First, what you're actually seeing here is a failure of UnitedHealthCare to effectively compete in the marketplace, and blame it on Obamacare.  It is not the government's job to make sure that private companies can make a profit - that's the job of their executives (for which they are lavishly compensated, regardless of whether they do or not).  The government's responsibility is to define the rules of the market, to ensure that all entrants have an equal opportunity to success.  In regulating insurance they have done exactly this.  Premiums are increasing substantially and there are something like 15M new customers, so it's kind of puzzling to see UHC cite Obamacare as a reason for it struggling.  A health insurance policy isn't a widget - it's a redistribution of risk, for which the insurance company charges a premium.

&gt; inverted totalitarianism is described as a system where corporations have corrupted and subverted democracy and where economics trumps politics.[5] In inverted totalitarianism, every natural resource and every living being is commodified and exploited to collapse as the citizenry is lulled and manipulated into surrendering their liberties and their participation in government through excess consumerism and sensationalism.[6][7]

Even more surprising, she specifically said she supported the call for $15 here in Seattle, the first major city to pass it.

&gt;I can tell you, this came as a news flash to all the activists and fast-food workers who fought hard against Big Business to win $15 in Seattle.

&gt;When we started, our demand was ridiculed by Seattleโs political and media establishment. We were told to โtone it down,โ not unlike Hillaryโs recent advice to Bernie.  For almost the entire 2013 election, no part of Seattleโs Democratic establishment supported $15 an hour. Local media asked mayoral and other city council candidates if they would support $15, and not a single one initially would! Some went out of their way to make opposing arguments, saying it would be a job killer, or that it was โpresumptuous.โ

&gt;At that point, if someone like Hillary Clinton had so much as tweeted in support of $15, it would have made our work a lot easier. But she did nothing of the kind."

Clinton had a strong hand with her original (?) stance of $12 as a national minimum with cities/regions able to choose to go higher. California and New York adopting $15 *fit perfectly* with her position yet she felt compelled to insert herself into the Fight for 15. 

FWIW I don't see the logic in NYC and a small town in the midwest (or wherever) having the same minimum wage. In this instance, Clinton had the better policy but completely blew it.

Glen Greenwald has done some great reporting on this over at The Intercept. Though it should be noted that we don't support corruption, either, for Bernie supporters to make hay out of Clinton's remarks by tying them to Dilma's impeachment would be to undermine the very values for which we stand while they are being attacked.

Crazy how...no, strike that. It's actually *sad* how every four years I get to watch this really nasty process of people growing up politically and watch people get their hopes up for some candidate that promises them free unlimited candy and then realize that the adults in the room think it's bad and they need to eat a balanced meal.

Paul (X2), Obama, Warren, now Trump/Sanders, it's always that one person who's going to save us all from the evil...whatever, and a large portion of Reddit then decides to demonize whoever is in their candidate's way for the better part of a year thinking they just might get their person where they want them to be.

Then it's a few months of wailing and gnashing of teeth, because politically realistically, free candy doth not run a nation nor does it make for good laws, and people who actually show up to polls know this. Their horse doesn't win, and the world is a wrong and evil place designed to keep them from getting their candy. 

The last Reddit backed hope that made office, really, was President Obama. And predictably, he didn't meet their high expectations so now he's routinely torn down by the same redditors that filled the front page with joy the day he was elected.

The likely truth? Hillary thought Rousseff was a good example of a leader, until later, we found out she wasn't. It wasn't bad judgment to say a nice thing about someone she wanted as a US ally then, and it doesn't reflect badly on her now that the woman wasn't. This is really an attempt to make Clinton look bad so the most recent anointed one looks like a better option.

Even if Bernie gets elected, he's still going to have to shake hands, be nice, make deals with and generally kiss ass of people you will not like. He will still have to order others to kill people that live somewhere else, and you may not like who it is, or why. He will have to sign into laws things you don't agree with, and advance policies that make America money but give power to someone you've decided is demonic. His halo will slip too.

Based on this, it seems very petty and more of like a middle finger to the Federal Government and now all those people on United Health are going to have to find other health insurance policies.

The lobbyists aren't giving money to tell a senator or congressman to vote a certain way, they're giving them  money so they can have access to argue and convince them that their position is the right one.  That's why there's no smoking gun where Hillary flip flops on a position in favor of a big bank.  It's a slow evolutionary process where people with the most money have the most access and therefore the loudest voices and the regular people views are drowned out.

Huh, I can think of a way to offset the FAA budget. $100/year for a private plane which would still be less than a car in several states is a start."

Do you think Democrats want to win the Presidency every four years only to be obstructed on everything by Republican majorities in the Congress? Obama spends 6 of his 8 years as a lame duck, of course the party is going to move to the right. Republicans have been sabotaging the economic recovery and shutting down the government and Obama never got any reinforcements in the midterms. 

People think that not voting for Democrats sends them a message to be more liberal when it in fact does the opposite. Conservatives vote reliably. Reliability is what the Democrats need more than anything, so they're becoming more conservative.

"2827","1460987779","Say what you will about Salon and its biases, writers, or whatever, but this article hits on something that most everyone in the nation can agree on. 

&gt;... more and more Americans are tired of voting for a politician simply because he or she is less ghastly than the other partyโs candidate.

First-Past-the-Post voting is one of the major roots of the issue and must be removed from use and operation. It essentially forces both candidates, representatives, and society itself into angry, extremist positions. That's not what we're about. That's not what we stand for. We are better than that. We can do better. 

[Range and/or Approval voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4a5ijh/privacy_sos_fbi_quietly_changes_its_privacy_rules/d0xt6nt) is where we need to move for the betterment of not only the nation, but the world, as well. We deserve better.  

With Range and/or Approval voting:

* People can still vote *exactly the same* as FPtP, if they want to.

* Requires *no new* voting machines *or* constitutional amendments (very important).  

* First-Past-the-Post voting doesn't give the electorate and representatives a chance to be more than binary nutcases, practically. FPtP voting forces both the people and representatives into black and white, extremist-esque thinking.

* If changing the voting system wouldn't help at all, as some like to argue, then there's no good reason not to advocate for changing it to something that *allows and provides for more expressivity and nuance.* &lt;------ the whole point and reason for having elections is to express preferences to the best of our ability, hello? express yoself! treat yoself! quit being robotic! 

* There's no good reason, no reason that doesn't fly in the face of liberty, freedom, and/or representative democracy not to go to something like **Range and/or Approval voting** - two methods that undoubtedly give our better nature's - our better selves - a chance to vote and be represented.

You have a choice between an honorable man promising you things he has no chance to deliver and a highly experienced, well seasoned woman who is uniquely qualified for the presidency, sufficiently left, isn't promising you the sun and the moon and is frankly better suited for the gig.

The media weren't merely tools to spread the propaganda of American exceptionalism, etc. They cut no corners in highlighting where the US was lagging, or highlighting where US policy was amoral.

Kennedy would explain his foreign policy decisions honestly and frankly to the American people.

The civil rights movement cheered when the national guard was deployed - because it was there to protect their demonstrations. What a far cry from Ferguson or Baltimore.

The Washington March was huge yet allowed to proceed undisturbed. In marked contrast to the demonstrations last week when hundreds were arrested.

In Mondayโs radio interview, Clinton reiterated that her love of hot sauce is partly to do with its health benefits.

"2996","1460992750","People seem to forget that the reason why social issues divide the parties now is that under Reagan the religious right became a primary constituency of the Republican party. Prior to the Voting Rights Act, social issues were not a relevant cleavage, mainly due to the fact that liberal Democrats coalitioned with southern (conservative) Democrats. As southern Democrats retired, they were replaced with southern (conservative) Republicans who barely changed policy positions but were more religious. The Democratic party was left with mainly northern liberals. As southern (former Democrats and new Republicans) and traditional Republicans largely agreed on fiscal policy, they were free to diversify on social issues. The Democrats, being largely liberal, had no control of the executive for 12 years (Reagan to HW). So to win back the executive, it makes sense that a more moderate Democrat was nominated (Clinton). However, the radical policies supported by Gingrich and the new conservative caucuses in Congress merely pushed Republicans farther to the right. Movement to the right incentivized Democrats to move to the left, but this really has only been seen on the social issue spectrum. The parties have both moved economically right the midpoint of the two party policies has largely remained largely very 'neo-liberal'.

Honestly, few politicians have different economic policies. Few dispute the free market as a useful mechanism, including Bernie. Separation is between advocating laissez-faire (Republican) or a tightly regulated  free market (Democrat). No one is advocating market socialism or anything actually radical. When people argue against free trade, it's more advocating no new trade agreements and some modifiers to existing agreements, not the reintroduction of tariffs. 

So is H. Clinton a moderate Republican? On economic policy, few aren't. On social policy, hell no. "

'In many areas poverty and its attendant ills afflict large numbers of Americans. Distrust and fear plague us all. Our inner cities teem with poor, crowded in slums. Many rural areas are run down and barren of challenge or opportunity. Minorities among usโparticularly the black community, the Mexican-American, the American Indianโsuffer disproportionately.""

""Air and water pollution, already acute in many areas, require vigorous state and federal action, regional planning, and maximum cooperation among neighboring cities, counties and states. We will encourage this planning and cooperation and also spur industrial participation by means of economic incentives.""

""Our metropolitan transportation systemsโthe lifelines of our citiesโhave become tangled webs of congestion which not only create vast citizen inconvenience, discontent and economic inefficiency, but also tend to barricade inner city people against job opportunities in suburban areas. We will encourage priority attention by private enterprise and all levels of government to sound planning and the rapid development of improved mass transportation systems, Additionally, in the location of federal buildings and installations and the awarding of federal contracts, account will be taken of such factors as traffic congestion, housing, and the effect on community development.""

""A vigorous nation-wide drive against trafficking in narcotics and dangerous drugs, including special emphasis on the first steps toward addiction the use of marijuana and such drugs as LSD; 
Total commitment to a federal program to deter, apprehend, prosecute, convict and punish the overlords of organized crime in America, including full implementation of the Congressional mandate that court-supervised wiretapping and electronic surveillance tools be used against the mobsters and racketeers...""

""We pledge to encourage the broadening of private health insurance plans, many of which cover hospital care only, and to review the operation of government hospital care programs in order to encourage more patients to utilize non-hospital facilities. Expansion of the number of doctors, nurses, and supporting staff to relieve shortages and spread the availability of health care services will have our support...""

I could go on, but the point is, from fiscal &amp; military positions, Hillary is absolutely a Nixonian/Reagan Republican. More Nixon than Reagan, in my opinion. Obviously she's progressive socially, but I think that's a reflection of the changing base of American voters, as social issues have long tended to be utilized to pander to a specific portion of  the base, and it's impossible to be a Democrat in 2016 without championing social issues."

The Roosevelt Democrats, and Democrats in general, got destroyed in presidential elections for a long time. McGovern lost an extremely lopsided election in 1972. Jimmy Carter served one term in 76. He only won that because he was an evangelical and Nixon scandalized the Republican party. Then Reagan dominated the next two election cycles. And then bush got the Republican party a third term. America was no longer interested in Roosevelt Democrats. They lost lop sided elections. The Democrats needed to reform themselves, and the Clintons did just that. 

I can appreciate how much you guys like Sanders, but the amount of hate I see on here for Clinton is counterproductive. She's a million times better than Ted Cruz, and she wouldn't win a single vote in a Republican primary.

"3033","1460996400","People have ignored a simple fact in this primary. Bernie Sanders is an agent of the Canadian government. Bernie Sanders has thus far won *every* primary/caucus in states bordering Canada. 

Bernie won Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Minnesota, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Indeed, excluding states bordering Canada, Hillary has won 18 contests, Bernie only 7.

CONNECT THE DOTS SHEEPLE!

Bernie Sanders is from Vermont, a major producer of *maple syrup*. The Canadians want to make Sanders president so that they can form a global maple syrup cartel. 

From 2012-2015, Canada exported over A BILLION DOLLARS worth of maple syrup, 84.9% of global exports. The US was the second largest exporter with 7.8% of exports. If you combined the two, you'd get a maple syrup BEHEMOTH with 92.7% of all exports. You could form a cartel that would make OPEC look like the Mickey Mouse Club.

The resulting price gouge will be terrible for the American consumer - the largest importers of maple syrup. Think about Bernie Sanders' policies. What is the real aim of all of them? Helping people? Redistributing wealth? No. Bernie Sanders is a pawn of the BRUNCH-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.

He wants to end tuition so that young people can have nice regular brunch, slathering their pancakes with CANADIAN maple syrup in a sugar shakedown for the ages. OPEN YOUR EYES!"
"3034","1460980824","This weekend, Sanders volunteers made 3 million GOTV phone calls, and had massive ground support canvassing.  I think the biggest detriment to him will be the closed primary.  I hope he can get enough *properly registered* voters out to close the gap somewhat.

I wonder how many thousands of people will show up at the polls thinking they are registered properly, and are turned away.  I can imagine a lot of angry people, justified or not.  

*A few other things that may help Bernie:  NY has little early voting, and difficult to obtain absentee voting; Clinton's campaign has relied on these heavily in every primary so far.  Also, NY shortened the polling hours, and there will be long lines; Sander's supporters seem to be younger and more passionate, which probably translates into being more willing to wait in long lines. Maybe a boost because of speech at Vatican, NY is 40% Catholic.

**I guess there's issues with voter status and registration.  If you're in NY, I copied this information from another thread:

Foreign policy in the Middle East may not be at the top of my issue list when it comes to voting, but a candidate's stance on the Middle East can tell so much about their critical thinking and skill at interpreting history.

To me, this issue effectively disqualifies the current crop of Republican candidates from the White House.

"3063","1460996004","So here's my take on Syria for the longest time:

If you are going to take a side, take a side that you want to win that could credibly do it. 

So far we've done very little in terms of side taking, HRC is talking about doing a little more. But most of the side taking has been along the lines of ""We will fuck up isis, because we want them to lose,"" and ""We will fuck up Assad, because we want him to lose."" 

Who do we want to win? I dunno, there's a couple groups in syria that are kinda secular. Sometimes they band together into larger groups but sometimes they fight each other. And some of them aren't as secular in practice as we were lead to believe when they were asking for weapons. So it'd be cool if one of them could win maybe? As long as it's not Isis or Assad. Then maybe all these heavily armed people will put their weapons down and have elections. 

That is not a strategy. That doesn't move the conflict to an end game. Picking losers without picking winners is a recipe for perpetual war. 

The Russians picked Assad as a winner. He has a significant military and a significant territory and a united organization within his sphere of influence. You and I may disagree that he's an appropriate choice, but it IS a choice. It is a strategy. It has a goal that if successful moves the conflict towards an end. It even allows for less ambitious end games such as ""We will ensure the Assad government, and therefore our interests, have considerable voice in some power-sharing agreement."" It is easy to imagine a spectrum of acceptable end-games for Russia. 

To anyone who disagrees with my assesment I ask, ""Who are we backing? What is their name?""

"3067","1461013928","How would there be a ""no fly zone"" established anyway? It would likely have to be approved through the UNSC and Russia would never allow it and frankly even China would probably go against it after what happened in Libya. That means there will be no ""no fly zone"". Of course it wouldn't work either even if approved. Libya and Syria are completely different zones of conflict. Libya also saw NATO forces attack Libyan forces so it was more than a simple no fly zone, but a bombing campaign. If the US tried bombing Syrian forces, Russia would intervene and potentially lead to war in Europe."

This is the level of thinking that prevails in Washington, it's mindless.

We don't want to stop the conflict, we want it to go on as long as possible, and to deepen and expand, dragging in as many Muslim groups and countries a possible, thereby weakening the Camp of Islam and Jihad. 

What is good for America and the world is to have as much intra-Muslim sectarian war as possible. 

America should do everything in its power to get Muslims to go to war with one another. This can be done by simply cutting Muslim countries off from aid, as just about every Muslim country is dependent on Western aid and help, including Saudi Arabia, which does not support itself.


Deprived of aid and industrial resources, Muslim countries will devolve into sectarian civil war and slaughter one another, slaughter which we can watch with grim satisfaction, knowing that wars waged by Muslims have no natural end.

"3105","1461010926","Let's break down the letter from Sanders' campaign (it was posted by OP elsewhere in the thread).

1) The DNC and the Clinton campaign created a joint fundraising team (""Hillary Victory Fund"") designed to partially raise funds for Clinton's campaign, but supposedly raise quite a bit more for down-ticket elections and the DNC.

2) The HVF is spending significant amounts of money soliciting small-amount donations via mail and electronic advertising. By the terms of the agreement, the Clinton campaign gets the first $2,700 of any donation--meaning that the DNC's fundraiser is pretty much diverting *all* of those small-amount donations to the Clinton campaign and *not* to down-ticket elections.

3) On top of that, the Clinton campaign has access to the DNC's donation lists in order to reach these donors, which may not be true for other campaigns.

4) and probably most importantly, it appears as though the Clinton campaign is either running this thing for themselves by themselves, or is receiving reimbursements (to the tune of $2.6 million dollars so far) from the HVF for unspecified ""overhead"" costs.

Tl;dr:

The DNC is seriously bending rules in order to directly raise money for Clinton's campaign and allow her to reach people she otherwise would not be able to, and to take a huge cut of money supposedly budgeted for down-ticket elections."

There is an unstated assumption there that he did something wrong - that he should have disclosed donations. It is left unstated, in an attempt to let the reader create the conclusion for themselves.

What is that technique called?

For example, if i said:

By phrasing it that way, the reader is being pushed to draw the conclusion that the author intends. When in reality, it is just a statement of fact.

What is the term for the technique of pushing the reader to draw a negative conclusion, but without having to say it directly?

&gt;The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organised political society.

&gt;This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.
   
&gt;**Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education).** It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

In that respect, they're not very different than the Hillary supporters that flock to CNN or the GOP members that flock to Fox.  

People don't value ""accuracy, timeliness, and clarity;"" they value confirmation of their own opinions."

"3252","1460999567","Clinton people say ""reddit is a pro-sanders echo chamber!"" and they have a point. But let's be honest: CNN, MSNBC, WaPo, the Globe?

"
"3253","1461010246","Hardly anyone trusts Congress, too, but people keep voting for the same congressmen over and over. Because their congressman isn't the problem. It's everyone else's congressman. 

Similarly, when you ask people if they trust the ""media,"" they'll say they don't trust the outlets that don't conform to their views. A conservative might say that he doesn't trust the media but still unquestioningly watches Fox News and reads the Wall Street Journal every day. Similarly a liberal might say he doesn't trust the media but still unquestioningly watches the The Young Turks and reads Salon every day.  

And of course all of this is perception. Ask the average person (or Redditor) why they don't trust the media and they'll cherrypick instances of bias that go against what they believe. Very rarely will you hear someone say ""I don't trust the media even when I agree with what they're saying."" "

A news organization makes money from advertisements. Which means they are incentivized by attention, not by informing.

Their profits are then tied to their ability to draw attention, which is not directly correlated with their ability to inform. Informing viewers/readers becomes only tangential to getting their attention.

Any news organization that puts informing over attention, also gives up profit. Meaning they go under or get absorbed by one who doesn't.

It's impossible for them to be anything else."

also professionalism is pretty important too. when live news studios will take in random callers on hearsay without validating them (e.x. 4chan anons who called in during the whole dorner incident) it shows how they're more concerned with getting high ratings than getting the truth."

Not saying Trump would be good, but come on, Hitler had a book on the shelves that called for global conquest and genocide while running for chancellor, Trump has one that says if you want to make a deal you must give people something they want. One of these things is not like the other."

&gt;We cannot allow our children to be poisoned by toxic drinking water just so a handful of fossil fuel companies can make even more in profits. There is simply no good way to contain the cocktail of toxic chemicals pumped into the ground.

&gt;**Moreover, the threat of methane emissions from fracking presents a profound danger to our climate. Methane traps more than 84 times the heat of carbon dioxide. While natural gas might burn cleaner than coal, the enormous explosion of fracking and the resulting release of methane presents a significant danger to our planet.**

&gt;Iโm proud that my state of Vermont has joined with New York to ban fracking. According to New Yorkโs Department of Environmental Conservation, **no amount of regulation can safely guard against the dangers fracking poses to our land, water, air, natural resources and public health.**

&gt;If we are serious about safe and clean drinking water and clean air, if we are serious about protecting the health of our children and families, and if we are serious about combating climate change, **we need to phase out fracking nationwide.**

In regards to national security and foreign affairs, it's a tie. They were equally as bad (at essentially the same problem. Carter had Iran and Obama has ISIS). In terms of worst president during their term, I'm going to lean Carter just because the economy was so much worse. On a longer term/legacy basis, I'm going Obama just because I think he has done more than anyone to break the country in two. The best thing about Carter's presidency was that it was only 4 years, unfortunately Obama has had 8 and Hillary wants to make it 12."

(http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-call-on-fcc-to_probe-cable-broadband-prices)

&gt;Friday, July 10, 2015
WASHINGTON, July 10 - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and three colleagues today asked the Federal Communications Commission to investigate โridiculous pricesโ for cable and broadband services.

&gt;โConsumers in our country have little or no choice in their Internet and cable provider,โ Sanders wrote in the letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. โAs a result, these companies are able to charge ridiculous prices and add hidden fees onto a customerโs bill,โ he added in the letter also signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Al Franken (D-Minn.). โItโs no wonder the American public rank these providers last in customer satisfaction,โ the senators said.

&gt;The letter asks the FCC to collect information on what Americans pay for broadband and cable services by location, provider and the fees these companies charge. Currently, America ranks 25th worldwide for broadband speed, and we pay more for poorer quality broadband than customers in Slovakia, Estonia, South Korea, and the U.K.

&gt;The recent increased concentration in the cable and Internet industries has created a de facto monopoly where substantial price increases have become the norm.

&gt;The senators said an investigation by the commission would give consumers a better understanding of cable and broadband prices. They also said it would help policymakers evaluate the impact of corporate mergers, such as a proposed deal involving Charter, Time-Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. 

&gt;โAmericans deserve affordable access to the Internet, not hidden fees and rising prices,โ said Sanders. โI hope Chairman Wheeler will take action and continue to defend American consumers.โ"

There is no voter suppression and there are no voter ID problems like in many Republican-led states. 

Every registered voter will be able to vote and if you are not currently registered, registering can easily be done online. http://registertovote.ca.gov/ You have until May 23, 2016 to register to vote in California.

Every registered voter will be able to vote in their state primaries, including for US Senator, because California has an open, top-two primary.

The problem is that some voters will not be able to vote in the presidential primary that they want to vote in because they accidentally registered for the American Independent Party, an extreme right-wing political party, instead of registering as a No Party Preference voter.

You can check you current party registration by going here: 

http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/registration-status/

Here are some of the rules for the presidential primary in California: If you want to vote in the Republican primary, you must be registered as a Republican. If you want to vote in the Democratic primary, you can be registered as a Democrat or as a No Party Preference voter.

I also suggested a simple fix: put the ""Decline to State"" box at the beginning, not the end of the alphabetical list of parties. Since it commonly refers to voters with no party preference, it would also be helpful to use the term ""independent"" (small i) somewhere in the description next to this box. 

Perhaps because independents are the fastest growing block of voters, neither D's nor R's really favor this change since it might mean even more people checking the box.

"3882","1460998188","As a Mormon myself, I will say that I understand why Trump is not popular in Utah.  He clashes with Mormon culture/lifestyle/religion.  If I were to admit I like Trump, I would likely be judged or questioned, ""Wow, you like him.  Maybe GeneticsGuy isn't a very righteous person to consider someone like Trump, an unrepentant sinner, as a candidate.""  Seriously, I was chatting with some fellow brethren after church and I expressed my like of Trump and it was like awkwardness all around. Good thing I am well-liked and know how to lead a conversation to make it less-awkward, but ya, it is a social minefield among Mormons to admit Trump support right now.

A large part of it has to do with a perceived anti-Hispanic aura about Trump, even though it's not really true.  The media has done a good job of pushing this ""Trump is racist"" thing, or the idea of the wall and such, and while Mormons are very conservative on social issues, for the most part, there are some anomalies, like with immigration.  Mormons are more lenient on immigration than the mainstream conservatives on the right.  Not just immigration though, but in the latin world as a whole.

Mexico has the 2nd largest population of Mormons outside of the US, and the vast majority of Mormons living outside of the US are in Mexico, Central and South America.  Utah has the higher % per capita of white people that speak Spanish (and Portuguese) fluently.  Why?  Many Mormons serve 2 year missions, and something like 60-70% of Mormon missionaries live in Latin-American nations and often develop a bit of a soft-spot for it.  So, painting Trump as anti-Hispanic (even though I believe he is not), has been largely a success by the media, and it shows harshly in a place like Utah.

There's many other reasons I won't go into, but he clashes, let's leave it at that.

Now, here is why these hypotheticals are stupid though and Utah is never going to vote for someone like Hillary or Bernie.  Abortion issues and gun control.  Right now, Trump is in the media and making a lot of noise.  The anti-Democrat media that will surely hit Utah in a general election only needs to touch on those 2 things and Utah will be right back in line.  The only difference is that instead of voting 75% Republican this year and 25% Democrat, they might vote 65-70% Republican this year instead.  It won't even be close, just like usual.

Bring up liberal ideologies of Bernie and Hillary and boom, they are going to drop like a rock.  This is why I say, even though these hypothetical polls are out there, they are just not going to be accurate at all.

These primary matchup hypotheticals rarely reflect how things are in the general election once it is finally down to 2 candidates."

PresidentยKabila was reportedly present during the abusive interrogation, which apparentlyยtook placeยon a farm he owns near Kinshasa. Afroamerica News describes its source for the beating story as an unnamed โofficial close to Rwandan President Paul Kagame.โ For the record, the parliament speaker was not my source for that article nor is he among the sources for this one.ยThis beating is just one more alleged injustice of the Kabila regime.

&gt;Itโs critical not to confuse โindependentsโ with โmoderates.โ Sandersโs career itself underscores that point: He long called himself an independent, even while compiling a very liberal voting record. Sanders has demonstrated a real outsider appeal that does better among people with a similar profile, people who lean left but are wary of calling themselves Democrats. But appealing to people who are especially disaffected politically is a double-edged sword: It wins votes disproportionately among people less likely to be registered as Democrats, putting Sanders at a disadvantage in closed primaries such as New Yorkโs and Pennsylvaniaโs. We should also avoid reading too much into Sandersโs support among independent leaners in terms of how heโd fare in November: The independents who vote in party primaries are in no way representative of independents generally."

PSA: Affordable Housing != Public Housing

Politicians have been conflating the two. That's not good for people who live in public housing.

Sanders public housing plan is a single line tucked into his much longer [Affordable Housing Plan](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-for-affordable-housing/), which is linked from OP's press release:

&gt; **Repair Public Housing.** We need sufficient funding for public housing operating and capital costs, and we need to reduce the unacceptable backlog of public housing capital needs.

[That's it](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-for-affordable-housing/).

Lawrence O'donnell has been talking about it all week, and he's right. **Neither of these Democratic candidates** have put forward good enough plans to help address the $17B in repairs needed for NYCHA residents... *who outnumber the entire population of Vermont...* And that's just public housing residents in New York City alone.

Both candidates talk a big game on affordable housing, but it's *not the same* as public housing. Affordable housing is a middle class issue. Public housing is different and should get specific, national visibility.

It's disgraceful how nobody is actually putting forward substantive policies that address the most basic housing needs of people who live in public housing.

I suppose the element of partial ownership would also empower residents and also smaller agencies and charities that help develop the buildings on top of the leased land. They'd be able to conduct their matters in a rational way.

Still, if we want affordable housing, we also need a lot more market rate housing. A lot more. At this point each large American city could be measured by how many housing units are delivered per year minus how many people need one.  Even luxury condo skyscrapers still serve a purpose if they act like a huge sink for excess money and demand that would gentrify and ruin outlying neighborhoods if wasn't being soaked up.

The federal government could actually help solve this problem, by tying funding given to projects to how responsible each recipient community is for the housing shortage. Places with ""growth management"" that's really just meant to exclude the plebs would find themselves under the gun."

"4406","1461030900","&gt;Black activists took aim at the financial arm of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) on Monday, with scathing accusations that the group is tied too closely to corporations undermining human rights and other black causes. 

&gt;In a letter to members of the CBC, the advocates โโ including leaders of Black Lives Matter and ColorOfChange โโ called on the lawmakers to overhaul the board of the CBC Political Action Committee in order to ""end the dominance of corporate lobbyists in its decision making.""

&gt;The critics say the current board is too closely aligned with corporations they deem harmful to black communities, including private prisons, certain pharmaceutical companies, student loan managers ""and anti-worker companies like Walmart.""

&gt;""The board should be lead by people accountable to Black folks, including elected officials and representatives from organizations representing the interests of Black people, not lobbyists paid to wield corporate power,"" the civil rights groups wrote. 

&gt;They're also asking that ""the board cut ties with funders from the private prison lobbyists, the tobacco industry, and the National Restaurant Association, just three of the worst corporate sponsors of the PAC.โ

&gt;""Between donors and board members, the committee is under the influence of some of the companies and industries with the worst track records of abuse and exploitation of Black people,"" they added.

&gt;The letter is also endorsed by the Black Alliance for Just Immigration and the Campaign for Media Justice.

&gt;**The CBC PAC, the fundraising arm of the caucus, boasts eight members of the CBC on its 21-member board. The others are largely lobbyists and consultants representing a number of prominent law firms around Washington and beyond.**

I recall reading that the actual CBC members weren't exactly pleased with the PAC's endorsement of Hillary.

EDIT: Yup.

This pay raise was staunchly opposed by foreign manufacturers who had set up shop in the country, and the United States Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development backed those manufacturers.  After Haiti's government mandated the raise, the United States aggressively (and successfully) pushed Haiti's president to lower the minimum wage for garment workers to what factory owners were willing to pay: the equivalent of about $0.31 an hour (or $2.50 per eight-hour day).

For example, I live in a city in the Midwest where $15 would be far more than a living wage; shouldn't the minimum wage be decided on a state-to-state basis? Obviously somewhere like New York/Cali need a high minimum wage because things are expensive. But if I'm living in say, Jackson Mississippi that's going to be quite a bit of money. Thoughts?

"4652","1460932191","The one major ignorance about Bernie's $15 dollar minimum wage is to failure to understand about cost of living costs in different communities and employer's ability to maintain that wage in a particular locality. $15 an hour minimum wage in a high-cost area where people have lots of disposible income is absolutely necessary just to get by without living on a stream.  However, in an area of rural Texas or Nebraska, the area just does not have enough high-paying jobs to sustain the increase in prices that it would take the business to cover the wage.  In addition, the living costs could be way cheaper allowing a person to survive on a lower wage than in Los Angeles or Seattle.  

The federal government pays its workers based on locality.  The most expensive areas have the highest wages while areas with lower wages have lower of cost of living.  Aka: that is minimum wage should be.  I think Hillary being a former cabinet member understand this very well.  Most of Bernie Sanders followers probably never worked the federal government and therefore, do not understand when Hillary makes reference to a $12 minimum for some areas and $15 dollars for other areas.

We are hearing about this now for two reasons: 1. They found out about the request because of the freedom of information act releasing Hillary's emails from her time as SoS. 2.

"4728","1460981674","So. Let's get a few things straight here starting with some history.  GE used PCBs during manufacturing of various components at its plant in Fort Edward. They had a permit to dump in the river. They vastly exceeded the amount they were allowed to dump heavily polluting the area near Fort Edward. 

PCBs will flow a bit in water (they look like an inkblot with a little oily sheen), but they are heavy and have a tendency to sink into soils leaching out a little at a time over. When the USACE blew up the earthen dam near the plant, rather than help anything, it spread the pollution down river for miles. While this diluted the pollution in any particular area, it also increased the cost of the cleanup substantially.  

Now, for the last decade GE has been paying to cleanup the pollution as mandated by the EPA under CERCLA. While GE and the EPA are still fighting in court over how much cleanup is required, in either groups opinions the cleanup is actually nearing its end. The majority of the remaining debate is more about the depth of the shipping channel and less about remaining pollution. 

Now on to what Bernie said.  GE will never pay to clean the river South of the Mohawk and frankly they shouldn't be forced to. There is so much other pollution flowing into the Hudson from the Mohawk (from Alcoa for example) there is no way to prove what was put there by GE. I know they have deep pockets and it would be nice to make them pay to clean this up instead of having it fall on taxpayers, but there is no legal recourse allowing for that to happen. Realistically, if people want to eat fish from the Hudson again, they are going to have to pay the taxes to fund a cleanup. 

America as a whole needs to start realizing that there was a price to the industrial revolution and that the bill is coming due in places like the Hudson valley. Or we can live with the current cancer cluster and avoid any fish from the river.

* US multinationals reported 43 percent of their foreign earnings from five tax havens, countries that accounted for only 4 percent of their foreign workforce and 7 percent of foreign investment.

His article purposefully covers for the monopolistic sins of past Democratic Presidents.

For starters, the entire reason Verizon doesn't have competition is b/c of the 1996 Telecommunications Bill signed into law by Bill Clinton, which allowed the mass consolidation of the telecommunications industry by way of mergers.  Remember all of the regional Bell companies?  Illinois Bell, Southwestern Bell, et al?  Remember MCI?  All of them were gobbled up as a result of that bill, which was bought &amp; paid for by powerful lobbies representing the interests of the telecom giants.  [SOURCE](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/34789-democracy-in-peril-twenty-years-of-media-consolidation-under-the-telecommunications-act)

In addition, the catastrophes of Wall Street were overwhelmingly a result of Clinton, who signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which deregulated the financial services industry, allowing for mass mergers &amp; consolidation of power.  It also removed much of the regulatory power of the SEC, giving banks free reign to do almost whatever they wanted.  Current Vice President, Joe Biden, was an ardent supporter of the bill.  

In addition, AT&amp;T just purchased DirecTV last year for over $48B.  The deal was announced in May 2014, it was presented to Obama's administration, went through the necessary channels, and was approved &amp; closed in July 2015.  Don't tell me President Obama was ""too busy"" dealing with the Bush years to care about one of the largest mergers in US history.  

Heck, the Affordable Care Act is nothing more than a legalized cash grab designed to funnel hundreds of billions into the hands of key pharmaceutical &amp; insurance companies.  

Further, the author is obviously biased.  Obama has been too busy over the last 8 years dealing with the economic impact of the Bush years, but Bush wasn't too busy dealing with 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, etc?  "

National networks of big-money donors funneled mountains of cash into targeted state races. By 2014, one party controlled both the governorโs mansion and the state legislature in 36 states โ the most since the 1950s.

"4998","1461050049","&gt;It's not just trade that's to blame. Technology plays a big role: With computers and automation, factories and all kinds of other workplaces need fewer people. And that kills a lot of jobs.

Seems like an odd thing to mention when we are talking specifically about jobs lost to china.  Most of that technology is being used in facilities in China too, and you'd think if the number of employees needed were so low we'd be seeing more of those factories staying in the US since labor would only be a small advantage that at large enough scales would be offset by the shipping costs. But China has a whole host of infrastructural advantages when it comes to manufacturing as well.

It's absolutely the case that automation is going to keep on killing off low-skill jobs until there eventually aren't any left. I'm interested to see what we do at that point because it really comes down to a question of either providing for a large percentage of the population who are essentially completely unemployable or else... not... providing for a large percentage of the population who are completely unemployable. Either way the effect on the economy will be pretty wild."

For months now I've seen posts indicating that Sanders is closing the gap with Clinton, or has closed the gap with Clinton, or that Sanders has defeated Clinton in some district/primary/whatever (I'm not American so I'm not completely ""up"" on the terminology/logistics). But these posts, which all seem to say the same thing over and over, keep coming up (like the proverbial arrow shot at a target; it covers half the remaining distance over and over but will never reach the target). I'm forced to conclude that all of the previous posts about him gaining were exaggerated, or there's something else coming into play that isn't being reported.

As it stands, after seeing all these similar posts, I get the impression that there's no way for him to win because, despite having the popular vote, there are too many die-hard Democrat super delegates that will be able to tip the scales in Clinton's favor no matter how well Sanders does. Am I reading this wrong? Am I alone in this assessment?

If this race were taking place in any other country, I would think that he would have/could have run as an independent and would end up as the next president. But I sense that isn't an option for him. Could someone ELI5 why he can't/hasn't run as an independent?

&gt; The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw &amp; Company Research (R).  The poll was conducted by telephone with live interviewers April 11-13, 2016 among a random national sample of 1,021 registered voters (RV).  Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 

&gt; Landline (489) and cellphone (532) telephone numbers were randomly selected for inclusion in the survey using a probability proportionate to size method, which means phone numbers for each state are proportional to the number of voters in each state.  Fieldwork conducted by Braun Research, Inc. of Princeton, NJ.

This part really sticks out with respect to the point the article is trying to make:

&gt;""How are we going to create wealth without Wall Street?...I think we can,"" he said on CNN's morning show ""New Day.""
Sanders has been clear that he thinks the big banks are hurting America in their current form. He has slammed them for being ""greedy"" and ""fraudulent"" since the first day of his campaign (and even before announcing his White House bid).
He thinks Wall Street has too much power, and the way to change that is to make banks like J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) smaller. But he's been criticized by rival Hillary Clinton and others for not being able to talk details on policing Wall Street.
""I think you can break up these large financial institutions,"" Sanders said.
""How?"" Cuomo asked.
""You can do it through Section 121 of Dodd-Frank. You can do it through my legislation. All you need is the secretary of Treasury to determine which banks, if they fail, will cause systemic damage to our economy. That's not a hard thing to do,"" Sanders said.
It's a big change for Sanders. Only a few weeks ago Sanders seemed confused about the Dodd--Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the major financial reform law that went into effect in the summer of 2010.
In an April 1 interview with the New York Daily News, Sanders said ""I don't know"" when pressed about details of the regulations that big banks face right now. His critics pounced.
Clinton says Glass-Steagall is akin to dial-up Internet. It's outdated. The financial industry has changed a lot. She argues the rise of hedge funds and other non-bank players means the U.S. needs different laws to protect taxpayers and the economy."
"5223","1461017591","Another example of how Sanders doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. All he ever talks about is banks being too large when that isn't even the problem.

The problem was weak regulation on a market that was rapidly getting more complex with ever more abstract bundled assets being created and illegal mortgage underwriting practices to create the supply for those assets. No one ever talks about the actual causes of the financial collapse; they just talk about how big the banks are, as if that has anything to do with why they collapsed.

How about instead of focusing on minimizing the damage caused when the collapse by keeping banks small, we stop them from fucking collapsing in the first place?

It's becoming more and more apparent to me that Sanders has about a dozen talking points about wall street, and that those talking points are his entire understanding of the financial crisis and wall street generally."
"5224","1461033701","I just want someone to ask him about specific investment banking activities, because I'm pretty sure he doesn't know what they are or what investment banks do."
"5225","1461002701","Are you shitting me? ""Bernie""??? Dude... bro... dude... wow...

Look, you can demonize the rich, that is fine, you can take otherwise fine upstanding citizens and organizations and convince your followers that they're establishment and doing the devils work... that's cool.

But come on, at some point you can't just keep going more and more off the deep end.

Being able to invest is pretty much the foundation for retirement in America, it's a function of our economy, we need it.

Sanders tweeted a couple of years ago that one of his life goals was to end capitalism... well, this would be a step towards that I guess."

WS is a parasitic virtual construct that creates no real wealth whatsoever. It actually siphons off wealth away from those who think up stuff, who invent, create and produce things. It's there to give yet more money and power to '*investors*' or '*fund managers*'  and other such parasites that have some much of it already they can position themselves to exploit the real economy. 

But that's not even what Bernie's referring to. He would let WS stand as it is. He just wants to divide some of the obscenely huge investment banks into smaller ones, to reduce their overwhelming power both over the US economy and US politics and to minimise the damage if one of them should fail.

Heโs the man with a vision
to better this country.
Running for president 
but the rich donโt want him.
Bernie Sanders is his name.
Now you're going to feel his burn.

New York is the state where he was born.
Brooklyn where he grew up.
As kid he started noticing 
the rich getting richer
and the poor working longer hours.
Still many don't make enough to survive.

He's the son of Immigrants 
who came in search of better lives.
Working to succeed
like we all do every day.
We come here with the same dream:
Provide our families a better chance at life.

The rich and the media don't like him
and theyโre scared that he can win.
He wants college to be free
so our children can progress.
He believes health care is for all.
Not a business, but a human right.

Years ago, in Chicago, he was arrested 
for protesting against segregation.
He doesnโt care about the color of your skin
to him we are all children of God.
Many call him Robin Hood
others call him The Bern.

Fighting for the rights of the people
even law enforcement could not stop him.
He'll keep battling until he becomes 
president of this nation.
Bernie Sanders is his name.
This is his corrido The Bern!"

"5348","1460925165","I am actually seeing this right now. Before I got to talk to my 49 yo mother about Bernie Sanders she had already heard about ""the old man"" and that he may be ""better than Hillary"". So it seems his recognition has risen. But make no mistake , many if most Latinos are okay with Hillary. 

While r politics loves Rosario Dawson taking jabs at Clinton and backing Sanders it should be noted Hillary has the support of a TON of Latino leaders like Eva Longoria, Ricky Martin, Salma Hayek. These are all people that have been advocating for the rights of Latinos for at least a decade now and certainly have more political scars and reach than Rosario Dawson. 

So it's not over until it's over. Bernie  can win California, but a lot has to happen before he gets here.

"5480","1460893255","Populism and anti-establishment feeling has sprung up across the world. 

See success of the Five Star movement in Italy, the election of Syriza in Greece and to a lesser extent the resurgence of the Front National in France and the presence of UKIP in the UK.

At some stage in the last half a decade the trust that people have in both politicians and the political process has dropped off a cliff. 

Now, in continental Europe, proportional voting systems mean that dissatisfaction is very easy to express and alternative parties can spring up, and get a foothold, in a matter of years or even months.

In the US things are different.

The first past the post voting system means that change is both difficult and slow. The quickest way to effect change is from within the existing party structure of the dominant parties the Republicans and the Democrats.

In the case of the Democrats Sanders had a slow start but has gained quickly as he established himself and his platform as an alternative candidate. His lack of name-recognition meant that he was always going to start on the back-foot against the well-known Hillary Clinton. It makes sense that he has picked up as time has gone-on but it looks like it may well be too late. 

The Republicans situation is almost the opposite. The insurgent candidate is immensely well known and has been for decades. This meant that he started on the front-foot. Trump has also benefited from a very split field. While the majority of votes cast have been for non-Trump candidates he was polling higher than any other perspective nominee. And in the winner-takes all states it meant that he mopped up.

We should also bear in mind that this is not the general election. The people voting in Primaries are self-selecting and represent a tiny-fraction of the electorate. And both the insurgent Republican and Democratic candidates are immensely unpopular with huge swathes of voters who identify as the opposite Party. 

Come the general it could be that the prevailing forces of conservatism favour an establishment candidate. 

Populism is a double-edged sword in this race. It can win you the nomination but lose you the general election. "

"5491","1460922547","Gather round children and I'll tell you a tale, about how our political system came to be...

When designing our electoral system the founders instituted a simple first-past-the-post system that had been the standard in most western democracies since the Athenians. Parties emerged, and every generation or so one party would get too out of touch and a new party would replace them. The Democrat-Republicans replaced the Federalists, the Democrats and the Whigs replaced the Democrat-Republicans (truly beginning the two party system) and the Whigs were replaced by the Republicans. Then in 1912 Theodore Roosevelt tried to do this again by running under the Bull Moose Progressive Party, but something different happened this time. Rather than grow into their own party, the progressive Republicans who joined TR in 1912 jumped ship for the Democrats. Both parties were now much more powerful than their predecessors had been, thanks to the increased cost of running a national campaign, and it became harder to simply unseat one with a newer agenda. Another interesting change began at the turn of the 20th century: Political Primaries started to be adopted. Only about a dozen states ever used them to assign delegates, and both parties still preferred to nominate at a national convention, but the progressive era was beginning to lay the groundwork for a more involved body politic than in previous generations, and a greater scrutiny towards political elites/party bosses. Successive elections like 1924, 1948 and 1960 would see progressives leave the Republican party and racists leave the Democratic party, leaving the Democrats with smaller conservative wings and Republicans with smaller Liberal wings.

Then came 1968, [the last election until 2008 that would see voter turnout break 60%](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voter_turnout.png) and in that election we saw a paradigm shift in political culture. This would be the election that purged the last elements of the ""Dixiecrats"" (racist southern Democrats) from the Democratic party and set the stage for the rise of national primaries. For the Republicans, the primary contest was a close race between Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon (Reagan narrowly won the primary contest), but Nixon won the national convention handily... for the Democrats it was a very different story. Hubert Humphrey, as Johnson's VP, had to run in support of the Vietnam war, with college students and African American democrats hated, and they voted in the primaries overwhelmingly in opposition to Humphrey. 69% of primary voters voted for either Bobby Kennedy or Gene McCarthy, and most Kennedy supporters believed McCarthy would be their guy after Kennedy was assassinated. With only 2.21% of primary voters supporting him, McCarthy still received the Democratic party nomination. The result was a close race in terms of the popular vote, but one where Richard Nixon swept 32 states and 301 electoral votes. The Democrats blamed their loss on Humphrey (and the party nominating system) failing to engage minorities, women, and the youth. So in 1969 the McGovernโFraser Commission adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for the aforementioned voters, leading to most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections.

And this is where things start to fall apart. The primary process (also adopted by the Republicans, much for the same reasons outlined in the McGovernโFraser Commission) resulted in the parties seeking ideological purity over electability and a desire to govern. At first the system was just chaotic, with no clear consensus candidates between 1972 and 1980 for the Democrats, and primary challengers for both parties in 1976 and 1980. Ronald Reagan was really the first candidate to use the primary process to his advantage by building a coalition from within his party rather than the traditional process of parties building coalitions among demographic interests. And there's the problem: primary voters are party loyalists often more interested in ideological purity than electability or the ability to govern. And if all you have to do to win the election is appeal to the party ideology, guess what? The more moderate members will start to leave and not vote in the general. This is what led to the low turnouts of the late 20th Century and early 2000s. Also, primaries made elections longer and more expensive, not just for Presidential campaigns, but for House and Senate elections as well. Politicians had to simultaneously appeal to the worst elements within their party and interest groups who now could directly influence politicians rather than negotiate with party leaders. So parties got more radical and voters less interested. Things changed under the Bush administration as the country's disgust with his policies led to the Democratic ""Big Tent"" (that pushed the party more to the middle), but the radicalization in the primary process continued (it just got a reprieve in the Democratic party), and that's how we wound up with the current crop of Republican nut bags, and one very liberal independent and one center-left (by American Standards) Democratic candidates.

TL/DR: Primaries suck."

You all rant and rave about corporations supposedly stripping you of your rights, yet you do not even take a moment to think about what your movement would create. Undoubtedly, it would lead to handing political power to the hands of a few. You would be trading what is in reality minimal corporate overreach for something remarkably worse.

"5594","1460915740","One of the things about getting excessive money out of politics is that a bunch of spending is required to get it done. Either money spent on initiatives/referenda or money spent on candidates.

If a state/congress passes a law that is challenged due to Citizens United/SpeechNow and the court upholds that law, it doesn't just bring back the laws overturned by those cases. The quickest way to ""overturn"" those decisions is to pass tougher laws and take your chances that the court is more favorable.

So there's a inherent contradiction in play where money would need to be spent to elect candidates that support a better campaign finance system.

This Fox TV thing is a *very*  pro-Sanders article - so why does the Reddit Headline above intentionally miss that?

Is Sanders so upset with that statement?  That he has to hide it on Reddit? Then he's **really** not going to like this one, is he:

&gt;What Clooney pointed to is that Clinton has been bringing in millions of dollars, not just for her campaign, but also for Democrats running in House, Senate and other local races.

&gt;""It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress,"" Clooney said on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday. ""And the reason that's important, and the reason it's important to me, is because we need โ I'm a Democrat. So if you're a Republican, you're going to disagree, but we need to take the Senate back.""

http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474585666/george-clooney-on-a-big-money-difference-between-clinton-and-sanders

The the headline above manages to miss the first major point **even though it is central to Bernies campaign!**

Why?  Why throw the major point out?  Huh? Possibly because no one would pay attention if the actual (Fox) headline was used?

But since it mentions this indirectly, it is time that we look at it.  The problem is two fold.

1.  Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will be carpet bombed by Adelson, Pope, the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Bush Rangers. Ad Sanders is not equipped to deal with that. And rejecting the strongest statement Clooney made about it just makes Sanders  worse off. 

2.  What Clooney ALSO Said: Democrat Congressional campaigns also need money  and Bernie Sanders has no clue how to handle this. 

The entire attempt to get rid of Citizens United requires a team. Otherwise it would  end in a fiasco if there is no money for Congressional campaigns and apparently Bernie Sanders has no plans.
"
"5645","1460944622","That *obscene* amount of money is mainly going to the downballot to turn the Senate blue and hopefully (over the next two elections) the House. Sanders has not raised a nickle to help Democrats running in November. Which is astonishing."
"5646","1460922468","The article is actually largely about Bernie. AND the quote from George Clooney IS INCOMPLETE!  And My sense is it was done that way specifically to AVOID the problems that Bernie Sanders is creating.

Could we possibly consider what the article actually is instead of pretending that this is something written by George Clooney and that its accurate.  

It is neither.   There is much truth to what he says but that is only PARTLY considered by the headline and since people ""Vote up"" these headlines without every discussing the or finding out that they aren't complete, they become lies created for the benefit of Fox News or some other source where A) it gets to USE Reddit to post its headlines for free or B) someone USES the people in the article for their own purpose.

Many folks here seem to be under the delusion that someone who is a climate denier is denying that the Earth goes through climate shifts. That is not the case at all. 

I myself am what most of you would call a ""climate denier"", but not because I don't believe in the effects of climate change. Quite the contrary. I live in Alaska. I have seen first hand the effects of climate change. When I was growing up we never used to have thunder storms in the summer, and now we get them every year. In my life time I have seen the reduction of one of our glaciers. The question with all of this change is not whether or not it is happening, buy WHY it is happening. I question the narrative that humans are causing climate change because in all the research presented, and in all the documentation I have seen, I have never seen anyone substantially account for the fact that we are living next to a giant ball of plasma that has its own shifts in climate over time. We have seen the history of the Earth in the rock sediment. We have an accurate history of the Earth going through heating and cooling cycles long before humans ever even arrived on the scene, let alone began using fossil fuels.

Denying someone their first amendment rights because they dare to say that humans are not the cause of climate change, and that the Sun is the likely culprit, is no different than when Galileo was put under house arrest for daring to suggest that humanity was not the center of the Universe and that the Earth might actually orbit the Sun. 

But of course I will likely receive several comments along the lines of ""he has fewer brain cells, so his opinions are invalid"", or ""don't listen to him, he doesn't believe in science"". If daring to have an opinion in 2016 is considered an act warranting damnation, then perhaps we have come full circle back to when the church was dictating every facet of reality. People who questioned the church hundreds of years ago were called ""blasphemers"", now it seems we are called ""deniers"", and to much the same effects. "

"5786","1460929638","&gt;The problem with this new wrinkle in Hillary Clinton's K-12 education agenda is the assertion that the federal government is to blame for over-testing. Nothing could be further from the truth. __On average, federal policies account for seven hours of testing per year โ roughly 0.6 percent of an average school year.__ The time students spend on assessments required by states and school districts is, on average, two to three times that required by the federal government.

This seems very reasonable. The federal government should prevent state governments from enacting their own standardized testing."
"5787","1460955145","Pre statement: I like Bernie Sanders and do not trust/respect Hillary for a vast majority of her views and actions. I am a high school math/science teacher at an alternative High School.

That being said, I agree with Hillary on this issue - state testing in its current iteration needs to end. Although the federal requirement only asks for 7 hours of testing a year, those seven hours ripple out into the rest of the school year and warp the education of my students.

I hate those tests.

I could elaborate on any of the following points, but I want to clearly explain why the testing requirements need to end.

1) The federal requirement has shifted the focus of education from learning many/deep ideas to testing well. This has impoverished our curriculum by focusing teachers on how to cover test material instead of the art of teaching. Do you remember the review day before a high school test -- it's like that for the whole year. Teaching on rails sucks.

2) Required testing creates more required testing. Because school districts have a financial incentive for their their kids to test well, they are driven to give the students more tests throughout the year to make sure they know if the kids will test well during the test that counts. Schools do not use the federally mandated tests to measure themselves -- that would be a lagging indicator. Instead, they use predictive tests several times a year to map out students' progress so they know they will be ready for the Big One.

3 &amp; 4) There are rarely accommodations for students who do not test well (test anxiety, better at once subject than another, life events outside school impacting their attentiveness, lower levels of Academic English because they speak another language at home, etc.). This leads students to believe they are stupid when they are simply different. Or, 4) they had a bad day.

Which leads to

5) This can be a barrier to graduation. Some students are not able to get their high school diploma because they did not meet the testing requirements for graduation. While this is only a few students, it is abominable to me that this happens at all. Some legislatures are making changes to ensure this does not happen, but the fact that it existed at all is morally wrong to me.

It is for these reasons and several more which are harder to quantify that I oppose high-stakes testing. It is one thing if we want to test our students to ""take their temperature"" so to speak. It is entirely a different sort of thing to ""measure their height"" and deem that some students are to ""short"" to be part of our society."
"5788","1460932818","""Apparently, the Clintons have parted ways with the vast majority of fellow Democrats, as well as civil rights and business groups, on the importance of annually measuring student progress against state academic benchmarks. Just last week, stumping on the campaign trail, former President Bill Clinton announced that Hillary Clinton ""thinks the federal government requires too many tests for U.S. schoolchildren.""

Unlike the phony debate about Common Core on the Republican side, this is an issue where the policies of the next president will actually matter. **And if Hillary Clinton acted to roll back what are already fairly minimal federal testing requirements, it would be to the detriment of our students, particularly poor and minority children, children of recent immigrants and students with disabilities.**

It's likely no coincidence that Bill Clinton made these comments in the lead-up to the Democratic primary in New York, where polls show the former secretary of state with a narrower lead than expected over rival and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. **The announcement also came on the eve of the first day of annual student testing in New York, where some largely well-to-do, suburban activists have been advocating that parents opt their children out of taking state assessments.**"""

I'm from New York. Western New York, though. The land of arctic wastelands and factories. I don't at all associate Bernie with New York. He's from Vermont.

Also as a Western New Yorker, it annoys me when people forget that there's an entire other part of the state that isn't NYC, but are all still ""New Yorkers."" Yes, that Apple Farmer is a New Yorker, as much as that logger, that engineer, that scientest. The line worker in Buffalo. The web developer in Rochester. All New Yorkers. You can't put all of them under one little bubble of opinions. And you certainly can't pretend a dude from Vermont is from New York. Doing that will just put people off of Bernie. Because if there's one thing New Yorkers all hate, it's people wearing I &lt;3 NY t-shirts who aren't even from the state or were born here or visited it as a kid and want to pretend they're part of the state because New York is awesome and everyone wants to be from New York. 

Hillary and Trump can call themselves New Yorkers because both of them put in the work to gain the state's respect and be accepted as important and well known people of the state. Bernie has spent the majority of his life in Vermont and lol Mr Ohio and the Zodiac Killer. Especially the latter. Pro-tip: Don't insult an entire state you need to win."

It could be, for example, that Cruz and Trump would make things worse than her - making her the favourable candidate in that instance. Or, perhaps, that Sanders would improve relations compared to her - in which case he would be favourable.

"5980","1460911392","In terms of foreign policy, I think Hillary Clinton will be the best out there.   I will tell you why.  For years, I leaned somewhat towards the isolationist policy similar to that of Ron Paul, and perhaps Bernie Sanders too.  But from what I have seen in the last 8 years, I concluded that this isolationistic view was naive.  If the USA completely withdraws from intervention everywhere in the world, it will have a great impact on the US economy.  Gasoline will be $7/gallon.  Travel will be much more expensive.  Things will be much more costly.  I don't think Americans can deal with this.  But once you intervene, it's very hard not to be aggressive.  Look at Russia, China, Iran, etc.  Whenever they sense weakness from the US, they make a move.  China in Southeast Asia. Russia in the Middle East.  It's like football, if you don't watch, they gain a few yards.  So, the reality is you have to keep these guys in check.  What makes things complicated is that with China in particular, you also do business with them.  So, it requires a very sophisticated leader who is willing to participate in diplomacy as well as is prepared to be strong if necessary.  This is why I think Clinton is the great fit for this role at this time.  I don't think she's as hawkish as these guys portrayed her.  Don't forget she championed the ""reset"" with Russia.  It was successful for a while, when she was in office.  I think Clinton possesses a balanced understanding of diplomacy and military engagement that is better than anyone else in this race.

America has become a hive of Politicalcorrectness, since Obama came into office 7 years ago; it has been a Leftistradical plot, which has been regressive to essentiallytransform America into a third worldcountry.  Look at what this President hasachieved by the time he leaves the White House. Allowing millions of illegalaliens to enter the country, claiming he has executive right to enter withoutany encumbrance from the US Border Patrol and even any need to see a judge.There are limits even to a sitting President, according to Article (1) of theConstitution, but he has already spat on the Congress that he has a lawfulright, to do as he wishes, but to ignore the overwhelming majority thatcitizens who want serious enforcement.

 

Not only the illegal alien invasion causedby Obamas failure to stop this travesty, but because of the 14th amendment andthe fabrication that not only slaves that after the Civil War can gaincitizenship, but yet people admitted through chain-migration or the so-calledfamily reunification policies that led to the admission of 1,976,122immigrants to America in the last three years driven by Obama. Every one ofthose newly admitted immigrants represents a new demand on Americaโs schools, roads, healthcare,and other public services by people who has contributed all but zero to fundingthem. Citizens have worked all their lives and millions of people comeinto our nation and collect welfare and every other public service, whileObamas administration has served to the American people a $19 plus Trilliondollar deficit that's climbing. You have to ask why this lame-duck president ispandering to millions of illegal aliens, when our Senior low income Citizenscan hardly exist on what they get and the fact that Vets, who came home maimedand broken have to wait for appointments, and now its known many commit suicideor die waiting?"

**Here's the truth, from Scientific American:**

""Consensus science is a phrase often heard today in conjunction with anthropogenic global warming (AGW). Is there a consensus on AGW? There is. The tens of thousands of scientists who belong to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American Medical Association, the American Meteorological Society, the American Physical Society, the Geological Society of America, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most notably, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change all concur that AGW is in fact real. Why?""

""It is not because of the sheer number of scientists. After all, science is not conducted by poll. As Albert Einstein said in response to a 1931 book skeptical of relativity theory entitled 100 Authors against Einstein, 'Why 100? If I were wrong, one would have been enough.' The answer is that there is a convergence of evidence from multiple lines of inquiryโpollen, tree rings, ice cores, corals, glacial and polar ice-cap melt, sea-level rise, ecological shifts, carbon dioxide increases, the unprecedented rate of temperature increaseโthat all converge to a singular conclusion. AGW doubters point to the occasional anomaly in a particular data set, as if one incongruity gainsays all the other lines of evidence. But that is not how consilience science works. For AGW skeptics to overturn the consensus, they would need to find flaws with all the lines of supportive evidence and show a consistent convergence of evidence toward a different theory that explains the data.""

&gt;

Americans today are selfish assholes who can't equate this fact. You've been thought to think that you can have this and still not pay higher taxes. You cannot. 

You need to ask yourself: What is more important to you? 35% tax rates or all these programs. That is really what it comes down to. 

Even Sanders is guilty of pulling this trick on you. Thinking that you can have it both. Although, granted, he's been mentioning it briefly at times. Hillary and the others have understood though. That you all actually want both. So they are forced to find a middle ground. Promising social programs and only manage to deliver some that is good enough for the general public. While doing tax breaks at the same time. That is a recipe for disaster. And you are to blame for it when you ask for both extended social programs and tax breaks. "

As far as I'm concerned they don't have as much Economic weight as they think they do.. We're importing &lt; 15% of our Oil from Saudi Arabia now and something like 40% from Canada. 

We're really not as dependent on Middle Eastern Oil as we used to be and that just becomes more and more true every year. 

Honestly, just look at the Data from 2009 through today.. You'll see it starting to take a big fuckin' nose dive.

http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec3_8.pdf

OPEC Imports aren't what makes up a majority of our Oil anymore and now that Sanctions have been lifted on Iran they've had a direct influence on Saudi Arabia's (used to be cornered) Market and now Saudi Arabia's hurting. 

Honestly in a lot of ways (this is speculation though so take it with a grain of salt) this is probably why we tried so hard to get this Nuclear Deal passed with Iran, to try and squeeze Saudi Arabia as much as we could after all these years. 

Edit: 

One thing I forgot to mention.. I'm not sure what the Imports look like for OTHER countries though. I mean I know Saudi Arabia is still an Oil Powerhouse but they're not ""the powerhouse"" anymore and just to reiterate, my source for their financial troubles is the IMF which should also be taken with a grain of salt.

Suppose they did decide to sell -- they have to sell at whatever levels the market is offering.  T-bill prices would drop like a rock, and yields would spike, and SA would realize huge losses by selling T-bills for far less than they'd bought them.  Meanwhile, other investors would be scrambling to buy T-bills at fire sale prices, likely dumping other asset classes to do so.  This activity would create some market turmoil, but the effects would tend to dissipate soon enough.

If you have a problem with this, you have a problem with the party system. This is all in place so they can exercise control over their platform and how they allocate the party's money. It's their money and infrastructure, not party outsiders and certainly not yours anymore if you handed it over.

This election is special in that we have not one but two candidates that are usurping the notoriety, infrastructure and money of the two dominate parties. If anything, I think that's what is unseemly here. There's something pretty disingenuous and manipulative about using the resources of a group that you openly say you have little in common with and have demonstrably acted in ways at odds with what they are.

This is Uber being misleading (no surprise there).

When companies like Reddit, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and basically everyone else except Uber release a transparency report they are reporting on data that was requested by law enforcement or agencies involved in national security. In other words, subpoenas, warrants, and so on.

Uber received ~400 of those kind of requests for user data, and ~200 for driver data.

Uber's transparency report includes that, plus a bunch of other data they have to give to various government agencies that has nothing to do with crime or law enforcement or national security.

For instance, legal, licensed transportation companies in California are required to provide certain rider data to the California Public Utilities Commission so that the PUC can determine whether or not the company is serving all kinds of passengers in any neighborhood or are discriminating against minorities or disabled people and things like that. In other words the kind of stuff that PUC, as the body that regulates these companies in California, needs to actually regulate them.

As part of a deal with the PUC to not be shut down in California for operating an illegal, unlicensed taxi service Uber agreed to also provide this data. (And then they tried to renege on their agreement, were fined $7.6 million dollars, and then provided the data)."

Here is some info I posted before on some of the shadiness from the last Clinton presidency:

If they do go back, and I hope they don't, let's ensure they understand what is to stay in the house when they depart this time.

[""After they were criticized for taking $190,000 worth of china, flatware, rugs, televisions, sofas and other gifts with them when they left, the Clintons announced last week that they would pay for $86,000 worth of gifts, or nearly half the amount.""](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121856&amp;amp;page=1)

Also:
""Lawmakers are questioning Clintonโs desire to rent expensive office space in New York City at government expense. Because of the contention, the former presidentโs foundation has offered to pay at least $300,000 of an estimated $790,000 annual rent for the office Clinton favors.
**Mrs. Clinton, the new senator from New York, has faced questions about the propriety of accepting the gifts in the period between her election and her swearing-in.** Senate rules would have limited what she could accept had she been a senator.
Members of both parties also have criticized Clinton for granting scores of eleventh-hour clemency requests, including the pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive in Switzerland from 51 counts in the United States of tax evasion and fraud.""

Are you sure you want these people back in office? Seriously.

Edit: what do ya know, Marc Rich was a hedge fund manager. Check this out: 

""Marc Rich (born Marcell David Reich; December 18, 1934 โ June 26, 2013) was an **international commodities trader, hedge fund manager, financier and businessman**. He was best known for founding the commodities company Glencore and for being indicted in the United States on **federal charges of tax evasion and illegally making oil deals with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis**. He was in Switzerland at the time of the indictment and never returned to the United States.  **He received a controversial presidential pardon from U.S. President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, Clinton's last day in office.**""

That kind of statement would hurt her among many liberals who, like Sanders, genuinely believe that the business of Wall Street is fraud. This of course reflects a severe disconnect in how investment and banking actually works. So I understand why she can't release the transcripts and frankly I don't blame her.

In almost every other way, she is actually *more* transparent than any of the other candidates, tax returns being a perfect example."

"6671","1460859198","For me, it's become not so much about the transcripts themselves but rather the defense she used to justify not releasing them. Saying she won't release them until republicans release theirs? Dodging the question by bringing up Sanders tax returns?

It's just shameful. I'd be angry if I weren't so disappointed. Clinton complains about being held to a different standard. As the media-crowned nominee, she's exactly the person who should be held to a higher standard.

meanwhile i thought ""well yeah BUT *you* aren't OBAMA"" and besides, correct me if i am wrong, but i also don't think Obama gave speeches to big intrest, i bet he did take money, but he didn't gave speeches. 

which why would you give a speech on a big corporation if it isn't a ""scratch my back, i'll scratch yours"" type of deal

"
"6676","1460862722","I'm not a Hillary supporter, but I don't really understand the drive to get the transcripts released.

Do I think it's a definite gray area of conflict of interest? Certainly. Although I don't think $200K is that much to someone like Hillary, it's still dodgy to take money from an industry that has too much influence already.

But do I think the speeches themselves contain a bunch of smoking gun gotchas? No way. I've been to events like this, and most likely if people did get their hands on the transcripts, they'd be bored out of their skulls reading them. The least boring scenario is that Hillary actually said something substantive, and you get an idea of her philosophy on how to change / govern the world. But it's not going to be stuff like, ""Make sure I get elected, and I'll make sure your industry is allowed to operate how it wants.""

Even if there *is* such an arrangement, that's a back room deal, not something she is announcing to the rank and file employees of a big company. First of all, that's not how these things are done, and second, in case you hadn't noticed, Hillary pays a *lot* of attention to what information gets into whose hands (hence the private email servers).

Of course, I'm lying a bit here. I actually do understand the drive to get transcripts released. Regardless of how dull they probably really are, by *insinuating* that they contain something interesting, it creates doubt, and that works for attacking Hillary. So that's obviously what it's about, but I'm really not a fan of tactics like that."
"6677","1460853008","What could there possibly be? We all know what they'll say, more or less.  They're obvious Wall Street pandering to raise campaign money that probably include support for policies that make Wall Street profitable and sustainable.

The audience seems to get the joke. There was no doubt among Goldman Sachs and the other banks that provided speaking fees that would be deemed illegal had she announced her candidacy that Clinton was going to run for President in 2016. They openly flaunt the fact that they have found a way to skirt the spirit of a law enacted to prevent the corruption of candidates who are ""actively"" running for office.

If she talked about running for office in those paid speeches it would be a crime. The bankers in that audience certainly ""knew"" as did the VP of Goldman who made the joke that she was running.

The contention here is, as a president can't legislate, he presumably will have to work through congress to get any of this stuff done. As a non-Democrat, he's not really doing any down-ticket campaigning. How is he going to get this stuff passed, if not with the help of a democratic house and senate?

I think that's a really fair point. Someone serious about accomplishing these big goals should be looking to the future, looking to hit certain way-points along the path to success. A friendly congress seems like a necessary step in the right direction, and the democratic party as the vehicle to reach a friendly congress seems like the only realistic approach.

Sticking with the two big ticket items mentioned in the article--free college and single-payer health care--how exactly is he going to accomplish these with a congress similar to our current one?"

Think about this while you're crying about these obviously rigged elections. The Clinton Foundation took 10's of millions from Saudi royals. Hillary Clinton turned around and sold them [$29bill in weapons as Secretary of State](http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187). The Saudis [murdered 24 children](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/22/families-were-blown-up-scenes-from-a-saudi-led-bombing-in-yemen/) last month with weapons sold to them through 'your' government. Nobody on Reddit gives a damn about this at all. They all keep chirping about delegate math and voting machines like this election was ever real to begin with.

How is it that there is no law that says politicians can't take money from people associated with countries that are clearly human rights abusers? How is it legal for Clinton to push through these weapons sales as Secretary of State after they gave their family foundation millions? How is there no accountability when the result is dead kids' bodies strewn out across a marketplace? Well look in the mirror cause you are the problem. You don't understand a damn thing and certainly don't give one shit about those people that were slaughtered. You sit on your fluffy ass and talk about delegate math and bs in the NY Times about voting machines.  In four years you'll get behind the next 'opposition' movement and fall for the same bullshit all over again. Maybe if you clowns didn't fall for this same thing every four years those kids would still be alive.  But sadly, you're all fake, good for nothing pieces of shit.

We need a member of congress to stand up for us and propose a law that says all leaders in the US are banned from taking money from people associated with human rights violating regimes. Period. If a leader takes money from a human rights violating regime and then sells them weapons then they will be charged with treason. Full stop.

I mean, what do you think the penalty is for treason in a place like North Korea or Saudi Arabia? Probably a lot worse than whatever that penalty is here. They'd get off easy no?

(""Sanders' supporters are lashing out, but here's how they might be hurting his campaign,"" April 15)

&gt;Having viewed all nine Democratic debates of the campaign, I have watched as Sanders has transformed from a thoughtful, even-tempered candidate with a coherent message to an increasingly strident, petulant and self-righteous crank.

So, he insults Sanders and his supporters... and then in the same message... asks for their support afterwards as shown with the final paragraph of that note to the editor:

&gt;Since it appears highly unlikely that Sanders can overcome Clinton's substantial lead to win the Democratic nomination, I hope that he and his enthusiastic backers will show Clinton the same magnanimity in 2016 that she showed Barack Obama in 2008.

This is the level of hypocrisy that is expected from Clinton and her supporters. The level of disdain they feel for supporters of Sanders is only matched by their level of entitlement of their support after the fact.

"6904","1461016500","One approach is to balance income tax against increasing wealth inequality, to keep inequality at current levels proportional to GDP. It's not a full tax plan, but it's a condition that different plans could meet. Not to say that level of tax is good or bad, but it can be calculated.

Piketty says, if r&gt;g then inequality increases. If the rate of return on capital is higher than the growth rate of the economy, then money accumulates with those who have it already. He says the return on capital is about 5%, as a surprisingly robust long term trend. If a country is in an economic boom with a real growth rate over 5%, they don't have to worry about wealth inequality. Old money dwindles relative to GDP, and a rising tide really does float all boats. Under those conditions.

The US growth rate is about 2%. That's not small, that's the long term global average. Economic booms occur under unique historical conditions, and there's no way to get one back just by building a wall. Piketty says the long term averages are about 5% and 2%. Therefore, the capital gains tax that balances against change in wealth inequality would be 60%. Return on investment would be pegged to real economic growth. They say they're job creators, and I believe them if growth is over 5%. Capital income tax could be lowered under those conditions, after all wealth inequality would be going down then. If growth is lower, they are creating less than their return, so they are rent seekers in the amount of the difference. 

To flesh it out a bit, income from capital and income from labor could be treated comparably, on the same brackets, with capital at a higher rate, topping out at 60%. Income from 'Capital gains' is not different from 'income'. This way the tax rate on the very top brackets would go up to 60%, rather than mysteriously down to 20%. Income from capital is distributed with wealth inequality, rather than income inequality, so the high rates will naturally fall on the very very highest earners. It would also reduce loopholes based on obscuring income as capital gains. CEOs could just pay themselves and be done with it, if that's the more efficient way. Income from labor could be taxed at a lower rate this way, to be revenue neutral.

Anyway, that's my formula for the 'zero level' of tax. Capitalism is inherently redistrubitory, under some circumstances. A top tax level over 60% is also redistribution, taxes during the wars were like that, and lower than that is 'redistribution' from a certain point of view. I put the balance point at 60%, at current rates. Sort of the opposite of the Laffer curve. The Reffal curve."

Your effective tax is lower than your tax bracket for most people who don't make millions because your first x amount of income is taxed at that tax bracket, then your next x amount of income is taxed at the next tax bracket. And then of course deductions are factored in, and not all income is taxable depending on where it comes from and what it pays for. To say because Bernie made $205k in gross income he should have paid 28% is a gross misrepresentation or misunderstanding of how the tax system works in the US. 

And to only say he paid 13% in taxes is also showing only half the picture, he paid closer to 20% when you factor in state income tax and Medicare. "

"6923","1461094675","So, they discount that Bernie *did* win the states with relatively high turnout compared to their turnout in the 2008 primaries, on the basis that it only broke the record-setting 2008 turnout in 7 out of 33 states so far (and most of those were caucuses)? That doesn't seem like very good reasoning, by which I mean it seems blatantly disingenuous.

The fact of the matter is that, when compared to the record turnout in the 2008 primaries, according to politifact's data, Bernie has won 7 of the top 10 states in terms of relative turnout, and 11 of the top 15, while Hillary has won 8 of the bottom 10, and 13 of the bottom 15. In addition, of the 4 states in the top 15 that Bernie *didn't* win, he was within 2 points in 2. That is clear *support for* Bernie's statement.

Arguably more importantly, though, I noticed in their table of turnout relative to 2008 that something seemed weird: the massive decline in Washington turnout, which didn't match my recollections of the turnout relative to 2008. So, with a couple seconds of digging, I realized what they did, and boy is it bullshit. See, in 2008, Washington held both a caucus and a primary, with the latter being essentially a preference poll, with no impact on the actual results. The 2008 primary drew nearly 700,000 votes, while the caucus drew only around [246,000](http://www.opb.org/news/article/washingtons-caucus-voter-turnout-2008-record/). But they took the 2008 primary (not caucus) turnout, and compared that to the 2016 caucus turnout. If one were to use an honest comparison, Washington's turnout was down about 6.5% from 2008, not nearly 67%."

Several analysts have projected that this change would close Social Security's funding gap for at least 75 years.""

Wealthier citizens live longer than poor ones. In some parts of the US, wealthier citizens live on average 13 years longer than poor citizen.

In this article it claims that this would transform social security from an insurance program into a welfare program that explicitly transfers wealth from the rich to the poor.

Removing the contribution cap on social security while leaving the annual benefits cap in place is the only plausible measure to correct for the difference in years in which the wealthiest can expect to benefit from their insurance investment.

Every measure to ""improve"" social security that proposes raising the retirement age explicitly transfers wealth from poor to rich.

* Father came from Poland and was satisfied with humble life he had as paint salesman. His mother was born and raised in the U.S. and had bigger dreams of wanting their own house. This would create tensions. 

&gt;That was a dream,โ he said. โShe died at the age of 46. She never achieved that dream.โ

* Doesn't like shopping after his experience of having his mother take him to 15+ stores to find the cheapest leather jacket. 

* Hillary Clinton  did a fundraising in California that costed $33K per person. Before that, she listened to five black mothers whose children died to gun violence.

Before that happens, we need a 9th justice, probably someone liberal.  And we need a Democratic Congress that's  willing to propose the campaign financing reforms we want despite them going against the current interpretation of the constitution.


Or, in what would be the most effective way to achieve it, we need to amend the constitution.  We all know how hard that is.

"7078","1460847653","I was there today (flew out from Los Angeles) and was among those arrested on the steps of the Capitol.  If you have questions let me know.  Most questions about the movement itself can be found at [democracyspring.org](http://www.democracyspring.org/) including [specific legislation](http://www.democracyspring.org/demands) proposed to combat the influence of big money interests in politics and voter suppression issues.

[Here's a photo](http://imgur.com/wxZ3Q9K) I took from the sit-in on the steps.  You can see the rally on the other side of the police line.  For the most part the Capitol city police were friendly.  I spent some time during processing talking to one of them about the Warriors for a while.

Here are a couple of short videos of the event: [one from the march](https://vid.me/vFFE) as we reached the Capitol and [one from the steps](https://vid.me/bjQA) right as we were about to begin the sit-in.

There was a 3 hour training session for those participating in the sit-in so many of us were well prepared and well informed.  Many people had participated in the arrests throughout the week and others had lots of experience in protests in years past.  The organization takes nonviolent direct action very seriously.  Members include Noam Chomsky and Lawrence Lessig as well as celebrities like Mark Ruffalo.

Those who chose to sit-in on the steps of the Capitol in violation of the law and be arrested were also fined $50, resulting in $45,000+ in fines.  Some people did go to jail and others were processed on-site (see details in comments below).  Those who chose not to sit-in (the majority) protested in the ""designated"" protest area.

The protests earlier in the week had coverage by better news organizations:
