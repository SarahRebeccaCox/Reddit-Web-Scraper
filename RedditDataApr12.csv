"77","1460463900","This is a fascinating response from the party chairman:
&gt; Asked why he told one campaign and not the other, Palacio said ""it didn't necessarily affect (them). It was our mistake that ended up affecting the estimation on Hillary's campaign.""

Apparently math only affects the Clinton campaign."
"78","1460460856","&gt;The error — first uncovered by The Denver Post — was shared with rival Hillary Clinton's campaign by party officials but kept from Sanders until the Post told his staff Monday night.

Sadly typical dishonest behavior from the corrupt Democratic party leadership.  

This revelation calls to question how many other occasions Bernie was shorted by caucus counting mistakes."
"79","1460462169","So, if there was a known counting mistake, can't that mistake be corrected?

*apparently it was corrected. That's good to hear "
"80","1460460857","Luckily Clinton is the ""most transparent public official in modern history"", so she immediately told the Sanders campaign about Colorado's mistake.

What, she *didn't*? Hey, wait a minute."
"81","1460464322","""Asked why he told one campaign and not the other, Palacio said ""it didn't necessarily affect (them). It was our mistake that ended up affecting the estimation on Hillary's campaign."" 

Wtf. Doesn't that ultimately end up hurting Sanders estimation as well? This is shady as hell. "
"82","1460465405","Key things to know:

This was an error in reporting that has essentially already been fixed. The error only affected the projected total that we see reported on election night.

The delegates were elected using the correct voting total, so Sanders will have the right number of delegates (and would have no matter if the Sanders campaign were told about the reporting error or not.)

Why only the Clinton campaign was only told makes little sense to me, and the explanation that the error only affected the Clinton campaign makes zero sense.

Colorado probably needs to get their act together "
"83","1460465521","American politics is broken.    
* Super PACs    
* Super delegates    
* Winner-takes-all states    
* Voters being told to get out of the room while voting takes place    
* Votes being counted by show of hands, scraps of paper    
* Waiting hours for votes to be counted, re-counted while voters get impatient and leave.    
* The whole caucus system     
* Arbitrary rules for deciding winners on a state-by-state basis, and in some cases these rules being arcane.         
* Lobby groups    
* Clear violation of procedures leading to zero action of recourse at all.    
* Electronic voting machines with no paper trail, non-open-source software, and count-center authorities not knowing what an MDB file is.    
* People being barred from voting at all.

Are you a democratic country or what exactly are you, USA?"
"84","1460477333","What really bugs me is all of this talk about ""at worst they end up tied""... no... that's if you're counting super-delegates. No one in there right mind would ever say that Sanders &amp; Clinton tied in Colorado. sanders won decisively and saying otherwise is deceptive. If you want to say that Sanders won, but they tied in delegates that's fine - but don't simply say ""they tied"". That indicates that they were about equally as popular which is bullshit."
"85","1460469096","Not defending the way the party handled it, but it should be noted for anyone who didn't read the article that it was a reporting error only. Both candidates received the correct number of delegates in the end.

&gt;The new math became apparent when the 1st District convention straw poll Saturday gave Sanders took five delegates and Clinton three. "
"86","1460472030","Caucuses suck. News at 11."
"87","1460476034","The way I see it, both the Democratic Party and Republican Party are trying to disenfranchise voters, just in different ways.

The Republican try and keep voters that they do not approve of from voting through ID requirements, gerrymandering and restricting voting in the areas they do not approve of.

The Democrats have super delegates to override the voters will at the convention. Sanders won Wyoming votes by 12%. Delegates were awarded Clinton 11 Sanders 7

Both sides are arrogant. The-powers-that-be know what is best for you, and you should just suck it up and accept that they know what is best for this country. 

The problem is that neither the Parties or elected officials are doing what is best for the USA any more. They are doing what is best for themselves individually first, their Party second , their social class third and maybe, if there are any scraps left over, the people of the United States might get a crumb.
"
"88","1460467442","They were going to tell the Sanders campaign, but they were running on CP time. "
"89","1460463687","Are they going to fix it?  Because there's still time.  If they don't fix it now, the Colorado Democratic party should be sued."
"90","1460465427","I'm confused: Did this actually cost him a delegate, or did it just make it look like he won one fewer delegate in the news for a while?"
"91","1460469992","It has nothing to do with Sanders or Trump.

This has everything to do with the fact that establishment party leaders think they are better than everyone else and think they can decide what's best for us.

Time to teach these ""party leaders"" a lesson."
"92","1460472416","I'm still not sure I understand how Colorado does the caucus thing. The article ends with this statement: ""To match the results from caucus night, a campaign's supporters need to show up in the same proportions to match the projections. Sanders won the state 60 percent to 40 percent in the popular vote and is expected to reap the benefits at the state convention if his supporters turn out."" How many times do Coloradans need to get out the vote before we know who wins the Democratic primary? Sanders won, but not really, unless folks also attend a state convention?"
"93","1460478260","""Whomever dialed the numbers in must have had a *little weirdness* happen.""

Just a little weirdness is all!"
"94","1460469069","That awkward moment when Donald Trump was right."
"95","1460464823","Gee now can somebody tell me what I should do WHEN MY POLITICAL PARTY DOESN""T REPRESENT ME? Should I vote for Hillary???? because I'm thinking more than ever .. Bernie or Bust was and is the correct reponse. "
"96","1460460509","Fucking hell. CO is fuckin' shitty. "
"97","1460470708","It's amazing how much corruption seems to be unearthed in both parties when you have ""non-establishment"" candidates who are making a good showing, or winning, on both sides of the aisle at the same time.  
  
Seems like there needs to be a shakeup of party leadership for both the Dems and the GOP.  They need to remember that their constituencies change, even if they themselves never do."
"98","1460472898","In Australia people resigned with grovelling apologies when 5000 Senate ballots were lost, the issue was investigated by the courts who then ruled a revote needed to happen. It really shocks me to see this stuff happen regularly in the US and no one bats an eye. Makes me quite sad that this happens. "
"99","1460474211","&gt;Even if Clinton wins all 12 superdelegates


Superdelegates are not 'won', they're bequeathed upon the chosen one.

&gt;If he lands one Colorado superdelegate — two are still undecided and others are facing significant pressure — Sanders could win the state's delegation.


Ffs he did win it, superdelegates generally vote for the most popular candidate at the end and should not be counted yet. The misinformation campaign during this primary season has been atrocious."
"100","1460476197","The lack of communication was odd but I think what people are misunderstanding here is that the party was not keeping the ""key delegate"" from Bernie until the Post reported this.  The proper amount of delegates were sent to the county convention and then on to the state convention.  The error was in the number reported to the press for primary night reporting.  The steps that the party goes through to get delegates to the national convention where going properly and not being tampered with.  Bernie was still going to get the proper number of earned delegates at the national convention. The Denver Post is doing some sensationalizing IMHO."
"101","1460476616","makes me feel so much better about being called 'petulant' by paul krugman for not wanting to unite behind hillary clinton /s"
"102","1460477068","Jesus. Fuck that woman and fuck her campaign. What's more shocking to me is that election rigging like this has been overlooked for over 40 years in the interest of keeping the elite in power. They're only being exposed now, when a popular outsider is fighting a system so obviously rigged against him. "
"103","1460477317","This is why I am not and never will be a democrat or part of ANY party.

I cannot handle people cheating, even if they are supposed to be on ""my team."" Winning is not what is important. Win honestly or go the fuck home. Anything less is an embarrassment."
"104","1460477816","No questions anymore that we have a government of the establishment, by the establishment, for the establishment.

And just to add to that allusion, these despicable rats obviously believe that they can fool all of the people all of the time.

""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable"""
"105","1460478089","Apparently the fix is on, deep, and Bernie Sanders has already officially taken second place, no matter what happens.  Does anyone really believe the delegates and superdelegates are going to vote, en masse, against Clinton, their insider candidate?  Anyone?  One would think the oligarchy is determined that only a Democratic Wall Street or a Republican Wall Street candidate will win.  Either will work.  The Party name - Democrat or Republican - is not that important.

So, when does this ""democracy"" thing kick in?

And only the Democrats in a state are allowed to vote in the closed primaries, even though ""Independents"" is a larger group than either Democrats or Republicans.  In Open Primary Wisconsin, Sanders won Independents 72 to 28.  Sanders has lost ALL the primaries in states that bar independents from voting.  New York only allows registered Democrats to vote in the Democratic Primaries.  Who do you suppose will win that fixed race?

The only way a Closed Primary makes sense in the real world is if Independents are barred from voting in the general election for President.  And, because of the Closed Primaries, they effectually ARE barred from having the opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choice, as they won't have the opportunity to show their preference for Sanders.

I'm amazed Sanders has hung on this long with all the DNC disrespect that's been heaped on him so far from Superdelegates, Wasserman Schultz, the press, and now Palacio."
"106","1460478596","So, there's going to be a correction right? Or has there already been?

Because, you know. Correcting primary mistakes far before the general is doable and potentially illegal if not corrected? Right?"
"107","1460464932","Add this to the long list of shady management of the DNC elections."
"108","1460461564","You know how it is. You go to Vermont, check out Ben &amp; Jerry's, visit a dairy farm, get some guns, and then head on to NY."
"109","1460461793","The dumbest part of this claim is that it wouldn't even be Bernie's fault. He's federal government, this would be cause by governors (who still, for some reason, support her).

Bernie should turn it around and blame Vermont's heroin epidemic on New York. But he won't, because he's above that."
"110","1460461480","&gt;We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. Clinton has carefully crafted its talking point to find the particular government data that support her point, which gives a wildly different view than how trafficking flows are tracked. 

Hillary Clinton told yet another of her carefully crafted bald-faced lies. She deserves four Pinocchios for this episode. 

 Hillary also needs to admit she lied and apologize to Sanders for her deliberately dishonest behavior."
"111","1460464326","Seeing as guns from Vermont cause so much crime, shouldn't Vermont have higher crime rates than New York?"
"112","1460470027","As a Vermonter, this pisses me off so much!
You can't just go to Vermont and buy a gun. If you live out of state you have to follow your states regulations. 
Any Vermont gun shop will sell you a gun if you are a Vermont resident. 
If not you can still buy a gun and have it shipped to an FFL your home state.

"115","1460466958","Okay, I spent way to much time finding this... I should have just linked the whole powerpoint from the original source which can be found [here](https://www.atf.gov/about/docs/report/new-york-firearms-trace-data-–-2014/download).  

For those to lazy to look for that I've also went and actually just grabbed the slide that relates to this argument, which can be found [here](http://imgur.com/ZND9rZN).

From this you can see almost as many guns come from California as do from VT... which is over 2438 miles away as apposed to VT which borders the state of NY.  Almost 7 times as many guns make it to NY and used in crimes from PA as from VT.

As a fun way to show that Hillary Clinton is just making fun data stats into pretend causality correlation, I've done the math that shows on the east coast states with lower total cow populations had less guns that were used in crimes in NY. [Source: for cow populations](http://beef2live.com/story-cattle-inventory-vs-human-population-state-0-114255)."
"116","1460463282","So weird.

People keep telling me Clinton has this thing won, the math is unassaible, she will be the Democratic Presidential nominee and only unrealistic delusional fools could say otherwise.

Yet, here she is, telling awful desperate lies about an already beaten opponent upsetting the few supporters he has that she will probably need.

Doesn't make much sense, am I missing something?"
"117","1460469360","Woo even West Virginia is contributing more guns to New York crimes.  We rarely succeed at beating Vermont at anything, but at least we did that.  "

I was waiting, hoping, they would mention that she was bullshitting, but nope, went to the commercial.

"257","1460473907","There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

This whole scheme - including this very article - seems geared toward privatizing education via ""charter schools"" - basically private schools using public dollars, the holy grail of crony capitalism. "
"258","1460476300","Education reform is and has been a shitbasket. Not to say the current system isn't in need of reform, but the reform that was being peddled was and is bad. Do you want a system where teachers are mearly administrators of the material, or where kids sit in front of computers all day using rigid learning programs with minimal teacher interaction? 

Reform usually comes in the form of busting teacher unions. How is the system going to get better if the focus is on reducing the number of teachers and reducing pay. "

"260","1460475136","Yeah, this is a good thing. Sorry, but the amount of emphasis placed on testing in the current environment is ridiculous. Kids aren't actually learning anything except how to cram names and dates into their head for one time usage on a test. 

This may actually be one of the first times I've seen the national testing agenda cast as sound progressive policy. A few years ago progressives were falling all over themselves to condemn No Child Left Behind and the emphasis it placed on national testing. Now Clinton's education stance is anti-progressive for opposing the testing culture?"
"261","1460479403","The only thing I gathered from this article is that Bill Clinton said that Hillary wishes to move away from constant standardized tests. Where the fuck do you get she's abandoning education from this?"

Besides she has already been fact checked.  She knows the media won't say she is a liar and she continues on the same thread today."
"268","1460478790","There's a little secret that many rural dems share, we appreciate his attitude towards guns. Gun laws required for the countryside have little to do with those required for a city of 9mil people."
"269","1460471560","ah balls, this is exactly what Clinton wants.  Whether she's lying or not, ""guns in the spotlight"" is their strategy because it's (quite literally) the only Sanders position they can legitimately attack him on.  I suspect they want a boiling point in time for Thursday night's questioning."
"270","1460477183","So Vermont definitely has issues with guns leaving their state illegally. This wasn't a very strong attack because it doesn't apply to New York in the same numbers. But Vermont is *per-capita* responsible for the most guns recovered in other states in general. 

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-vermont-guns-responsible-for-new-york-violence/

&gt;Her statistics come from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issued a report in 2013 saying **Vermont was in fact, adjusted for population, the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states.** That year, 23.5 guns per 100,000 residents, or a total of 147, were recovered in crimes committed outside of Vermont. The next-highest per capita state was New Hampshire, with 22.3 guns per 100,000 residents.

&gt;An ATF report from 2014 put Vermont in the top 15 states whose guns were recovered in New York. Still, it's worth noting that guns from Vermont are just a tiny fraction of the overall number of out-of-state guns recovered there: that year, Vermont's guns were 55 of the total 4,585 out-of-state guns. In the same year Georgia was the source for 386 out-of-state guns and 395 were traced to Virginia.

Here is her quote- ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest **per capita** number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""

So she was wrong about the New York part. But it is true that per- capita, Vermont is the number one source of guns recovered in other states. Which doesn't sound good, but obviously there aren't very many people in Vermont. "

Why are we gonna need a shit ton of coal? Because nuclear power is 19% of our grid and natural gas is a large amount too. And we want to be transitioning to renewables at the same time. 

But renewables won't be able to possibly come on line fast enough to cover our growing need for electricity if we really want to make all our cars ect electric as well. This means in the meantime, more coal, and more OIL imported from around the world, include Saudi.

Two, New York, while big, is only slightly bigger than his deficit in delegates.  Sanders would still be behind in delegates even with a big win in New York.

I'll answer that for him because Sanders isn't going to answer it and his supporters are only going to weave you another fucking web of lies:

If Bernie Sanders loses NY by the numbers all the polls are showing (13-20%), then his campaign goes from improbable to impossible. Yes, impossible. The Bernie Sanders crew will tell you ""nothing is impossible if you dream hard enough!"" Or ""nuh uh! He has a 5% chance of winning! That's hope!"".
It's not. 

Unless this is your first rodeo, you know how primaries and elections work. You know that nobody recovers from a loss that huge. You know that with a lead that fat, the supers will stay with Hillary. You know and are aware that Sanders has MAJOR weaknesses when it comes to campaigning and he probably won't be able to recover from the 300 delegate deficit after NY. You know that Hillary is going to absolutely win Indiana, Maryland, DC, Pennsylvania... Those states alone will deliver all the delegates Hillary needs to win. If she wins Maryland 60-40, it's wraps. If she wins PA by 55, it's wraps. If she wins Indiana by 50%, it's wraps. 

Another way to put it:He just isn't going to win in a meaningful way. If Bernie loses New York by the margins predicted (or by more), it will have erased almost all the gains he made all of March and early April. If she goes on to take PA like she's forecasted to, then she finishes erasing the Sanders wins and then pads her own lead... Again. Losing NY will mean Sanders has to win by a margin of 60% from here on out.


And he Berned through his favorable states with very little to show for it. They'll downvote me to shut me up, you can be guaranteed of that. But Jesus Christ, people in this sub ought to and need to hear the truth. This place is such a tight echo chamber people actually believe this race is close/neck and neck.

&gt;Bernies Sanders supporter and business/Corporate attorney here...

&gt;This is pretty common. Businesses incorporate in Delaware more than any other state, and a lot of those businesses don't actually have a physical business in Delaware. They need an address for service of process reasons, and so there are companies set up that just act as agents for that reason at one address. Every state has at least a few companies that are service of process agencies that will have thousands and thousands of companies listed under their address. Incredibly normal and honestly, not in the least bit shady. I help set up entities every day that are completely above-board that we use these types of agencies for. As an attorney, I am obligated to do what is legally permissible that is in my clients best interest. It's no different here.

&gt;*Edit: I should also note that setting up a business entity, which is more than likely pass-through and it is taxed as ordinary income, for consulting, receiving fees, etc. is not unusual in the least. I would have recommended that to every single one of my clients in their position, and I'm honestly surprised it took Bill until 2008 to set his LLC up.

&gt;**Edit part deux: There have been a lot of statements with the general tone of ""It's not about whether it's legal, it's about whether it is ethical,"" in regards to organizing entities in Delaware vs. their home state. My response to that would be two-fold:

&gt;First, the smallest and the largest of companies organize in Delaware not really for tax benefits, but because of the Court of Chancery and the extensive case-law Delaware provides (if she was setting up the limited liability company as a tax-haven, she would have organized it in Nevada--not Delaware). Over half of the companies organized in America are organized in Delaware, so they have judicial rulings on almost every aspect, whereas many states will have issues that have never even been brought before their Courts. It's all about certainty and speed. The Court of Chancery is incredibly quick (as is the Delaware Sec. of State's office) in resolving issues. Something that would probably take a year to litigate in California might be a few weeks in Delaware. In addition, they are constantly updating their statutes to correct and ambiguities or conflicting provisions--things other states just don't do. There are some banks that will only lend to companies organized in Delaware because of the certainty of their laws and court rulings. If you want businesses to organize in your home jurisdictions, then I beg you to encourage your state legislature to pour more money into our back-logged court system.

&gt;Second, and I can't stress this point enough, I guarantee you the most likely reason that their entities were incorporated in Delaware was probably because that's what their attorneys and accountants told them to do. There are some tax benefits for her to set up an LLC to receive revenue from her book deal in Delaware, as intangible assets aren't taxed (which is why a lot of bands, artists, consultants, authors, etc. will set up LLCs in Delaware), but the savings are likely not that huge. The biggest reason is probably because that is the jurisdiction her attorney's and accountants are familiar with and it makes their life a shit-ton easier. The type of LLC she set it is probably considered a ""disregarded entity"" anyways and is essentially treated as a sole proprietorship.

&gt;***Edit Part Trois: This is more a personal thing--I am a Bernie Sander's donor, volunteer, and even a state delegate for him. However, as several individuals have pointed out, a lot of my comments are essentially ""If you love Bernie Sanders for his policies, do whatever you can to help him win the nomination, but IF he doesn't--please for the sake of all that Bernie cares for, vote for Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination."" That's because I'm a pragmatist with idealist tendencies. And for me, the only issue is the Supreme Court. Go through my past comments and you will find a giant list of cases that were decided 5-4 which were harmful to the poor, to minorities, and to the average American and beneficial for the rich and corporations. The Supreme Court is basically all I've talked about since even before Scalia died. Bernie Sander's policies, progressive legislation of the past and future, and essentially everything liberals have fought for since the 1930s is under threat or has already been destroyed by a conservative Supreme Court. Don't give it another 30 years to keep undermining our Democracy.

&gt;Go read Sander's book ""An Outsider in the House"" beginning on page 24. Replace ""Bill"" with ""Hillary"" and ""Dick Armey"" with ""Paul Ryan"" and you have Bernie Sanders explaining exactly why I would support a Hillary Presidency if she gets the nomination vs Trump, Cruz (who is the most dangerous of any candidate in decades), John Kasich, or even Paul Ryan. This election is too important for a protest vote for me. So call me a shill for Hillary--I'll keep donating and working for Sanders regardless--but for the love of God, stop posting baseless smear shit like this or you are the same as Rush Limbaugh.

Yes, we all know how great Delaware is for business, yes we *know it's legal to operate like this*, but like many things this isn't a pull that the American people should have to continue to swallow. Incorporating in an area states away that has lower corporate taxes is a legal tax dodge, that doesn't make it okay and something which should be kept permanent.

Dear REPRESENTATIVE XXXX,

I am writing you today in support of Representative Rick Nolan's motion to declassify 28 pages of the 9-11 Commission's official report in the hope that you will do the same. As the most serious attack against the United States since Pearl Harbor, the terrorism of September 11th obviously holds an eminent place in our minds. Doubly so given that we have embroiled ourselves in what is now our third war related to the events of that tragic day. 

Consequently, it is essential that the American people have full knowledge of the circumstances and history of September 11th. It is only when we are fully informed that we will be able to make the important decisions required of a democratic electorate. There is no place for the sort of paternalism which would withhold critical information out of the fear that the voters are not equipped to reliably interpret it. To admit as much is a rejection of democratic principles.

If those 28 pages about the financing of the September 11th terrorists should reveal some shocking fact about our allies in Saudi Arabia so be it. Perhaps they should not be our allies after all.

Sincerely,

YYYY"

"798","1460441238","Since this is almost surely destined for the front-page, here are Clinton's [unabridged statements](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-hillary-clinton-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2596292) to the NYDN on Honduras (which is the basis for OP's article) for anyone who wants to read more:

&gt; **Daily News:** Secretary Clinton, I'd like to ask you if I can about Latin-America and the policies specifically you were directly involved in, the coup in Honduras. As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn't do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias adeal for new elections.

&gt; But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There's been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?

&gt; **Clinton:** Well, let me again try to put this in context. The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent the military to take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people, and that triggers a legal necessity. There's no way to get around it. So our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow walk and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of without calling it a coup.

&gt; So you're right. I worked very hard with leaders in the region and got Oscar Arias, the Nobel Prize winner, to take the lead on trying to broker a resolution. Without bloodshed. And that was very important to us that… Zelaya had friends and allies not just in Honduras but in some of the neighboring countries like Nicaragua, and that we could have had a terrible civil war that would have been just terrifying in its loss of life.

&gt; So I think we came out with a solution that did hold new elections, but it did not in any way address the structural, systemic problems in that society. And I share your concern that it's not just government actions. Drug gangs, traffickers of all kinds are preying on the people of Honduras.

&gt; So I think we need to do more of a Colombian plan for Central America, because remember what was going in Colombia when first my husband and then followed by President Bush had Plan Colombia, which was to try to use our leverage to rein in the government in their actions against the FARC and the guerillas, but also to help the government stop the advance of the FARC and guerillas.

&gt; And now we're in the middle of peace talks. It didn't happen overnight. It took a number of years, but I want to see a much more comprehensive approach towards Central America because it's just Honduras. The highest murder rate is in El Salvador and we've got Guatemala with all the problems you know so well.

&gt; So I think in retrospect we managed a very difficult situation without bloodshed, without a civil war that led to a new election, and I think that was better for the Honduran people, but we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with violence and the gangs and so much else.

"799","1460466170","Well, me try put this in context, Clinton is an imperialist with the blood of thousands upon thousands of Hondurans on her hands. Incidentally, she's wrong about the law as the wikileaks emails prove that even the DOS in Honduras believed this to be an illegal coup and called it as much in their own private channels. Outside of the US, there was unanimous agreement amongst our peers that the Honduran military had acted illegally. More importantly though, HRC has no remorse over any of the people that she has hurt over the course of her career, specifically as secretary of state. She has no problem lying to you and saying that her reasons for not using the word coup were humanitarian - as opposed to serving the financial interests of the oligarchs who constructed the coup and subsequently lobbied the State Department for preferential treatment. 

That's why I'm never voting for her, regardless of who wins the Democratic primary."

B) Show full support to the new post-coup leaders. Despite them taking power through an armed coup.

C) Call for immediate new elections assuming that the installation of a new democratically elected leader will defuse the clearly armed and ready to act opposition while maintaining democracy.

D) Ignore it. Honduras is Honduras's problem."

"828","1460412997","Why does the U.S. have the right to profits made overseas?  Shouldn't the tax on those profits be subject to those countries in which the profits are made?

This seems theft of a very low kind--the richest country in the world reaching into the economies of poorer countries to take funds that by right belong to them.  It is quite......imperial really.

"
"829","1460394052","The challenge with taxing overseas profits is that other corporations in those markets are not paying US tax rates. This means the US itself, would be making US companies less competitive compared to foreign companies in foreign markets.

Since the US has the [2nd highest effective corporate tax rate in the developed world](http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Special-Reports/Paying-Taxes-2014.pdf) and 15th highest of 189 countries analysed...if we taxed foreign profits at US tax rates, we would be ensuring that our companies are disadvantaged in almost every foreign market in the world."
"830","1460417058","With child-like wonder you all applaud these efforts, but you don't see the issue on the horizon.

How many of you know that the so called Nordic socialist countries have a much lower corporate tax rate than the US?  Or that Singapore, South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Japan all carve out tax shelters for their national champions?

China is destined to become the world's biggest economy in 25 years, if not sooner.  I don't mean by purchasing power parity measures ... I mean in absolute terms.  China will be the biggest market, and the US might even fall to third behind India.

Domination of foreign markets is in the interest of the US both from an economical point of view, and also a military point of view.  Having national companies that are dominant players in the most dynamic and competitive markets ensures that the nation's technology will remain ahead of competitors.

The US tax code is a terrible mix of loopholes and high rates.  If companies actually paid the US's ridiculous tax rates, they could not exist in competition with foreign companies.  They need the loopholes just to compete.

When margins are slim, even a small tax increase can mean the difference between profitable and unsustainable business.

The issue is that Sanders and his supporters don't understand that business is international and that markets are everywhere.  For sure you could force US companies to stay at home by making their foreign tax rates so high that they can't compete with anyone.  Then you would have to raise high tariff walls to keep foreign companies out of the US market, so US companies could survive at least in the domestic market.

But then you will have committed to tariffs and a protected market.

In the long run, the world outside the protected market will move on and leave the US far behind.  Markets outside the US won't be so protected and soft as the US market.  They'll be bloody and vicious.  In those markets companies will become lean and will evolve quickly.  Their technology and products will be better, because they will have to get better just to survive.

It'll be like when the Japanese Shogun shut off Japan from the outside world because he didn't like muskets and wanted to protect the sword-wielding Samurai.  Well, the outside world didn't stand still.  The outside world had bloody competition, and when the US came back a century later with warships and canons, the Japanese were far behind.

50 years of Sanders-type of tariffs, and high taxation, and our grand children will have a bunch of musket companies trying to face off against machine gun companies outside the US.

You want an example of this, see the history of India's auto company called Hindustan Motor Company (which made the Ambassador car).  Compare the Ambassador car in the year 2012 to any other car in that year.  That tells you the effectiveness of protecting national champions, instead of forcing them to compete abroad (with the best products and tax rates)."

Why is this important? Well if Ford were to make themselves a one massive legal entity like the lot of you are suggesting it makes the company liable for penalties in multiple juristictions and taxations in such
 For example if ford were to become one giant single entity what laws would it adhere to? Where would it pay its taxes?

He wants to force them to pay tax on income earned abroad, I don't think a single other major country does that.  Good luck.

As much as people want to kick and scream about it, Trump definitely has the best plan of action.  Overhaul the corporate tax system so that it's more forgiving to those who play by the rules, but more harsh on those that break them.

"924","1460391754","Bernies Sanders supporter and business/Corporate attorney here...

This is pretty common. Businesses incorporate in Delaware more than any other state, and a lot of those businesses don't actually have a physical business in Delaware. They need an address for service of process reasons, and so there are companies set up that just act as agents for that reason at one address. Every state has at least a few companies that are service of process agencies that will have thousands and thousands of companies listed under their address. Incredibly normal and honestly, not in the least bit shady. I help set up entities every day that are completely above-board that we use these types of agencies for. As an attorney, I am obligated to do what is legally permissible that is in my clients best interest. It's no different here.

*Edit: I should also note that setting up a business entity, which is more than likely pass-through and it is taxed as ordinary income, for consulting, receiving fees, etc. is not unusual in the least. I would have recommended that to every single one of my clients in their position, and I'm honestly surprised it took Bill until 2008 to set his LLC up.

**Edit part deux: There have been a lot of statements with the general tone of ""It's not about whether it's legal, it's about whether it is ethical,"" in regards to organizing entities in Delaware vs. their home state. My response to that would be two-fold: 

First, the smallest and the largest of companies organize in Delaware not really for tax benefits, but because of the Court of Chancery and the extensive case-law Delaware provides (if she was setting up the limited liability company as a tax-haven, she would have organized it in Nevada--not Delaware). Over half of the companies organized in America are organized in Delaware, so they have judicial rulings on almost every aspect, whereas many states will have issues that have never even been brought before their Courts. It's all about certainty and speed. The Court of Chancery is incredibly quick (as is the Delaware Sec. of State's office) in resolving issues. Something that would probably take a year to litigate in California might be a few weeks in Delaware. In addition, they are constantly updating their statutes to correct and ambiguities or conflicting provisions--things other states just don't do. There are some banks that will only lend to companies organized in Delaware because of the certainty of their laws and court rulings. If you want businesses to organize in your home jurisdictions, then I beg you to encourage your state legislature to pour more money into our back-logged court system.

Second, and I can't stress this point enough, I guarantee you the most likely reason that their entities were incorporated in Delaware was probably because that's what their attorneys and accountants told them to do. There are some tax benefits for her to set up an LLC to receive revenue from her book deal in Delaware, as intangible assets aren't taxed (which is why a lot of bands, artists, consultants, authors, etc. will set up LLCs in Delaware), but the savings are likely not that huge. The biggest reason is probably because that is the jurisdiction her attorney's and accountants are familiar with and it makes their life a shit-ton easier. The type of LLC she set it is probably considered a ""disregarded entity"" anyways and is essentially treated as a sole proprietorship.

***Edit Part Trois: This is more a personal thing--I am a Bernie Sander's donor, volunteer, and even a state delegate for him. However, as several individuals have pointed out, a lot of my comments are essentially ""If you love Bernie Sanders for his policies, do whatever you can to help him win the nomination, but IF he doesn't--please for the sake of all that Bernie cares for, vote for Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination."" That's because I'm a pragmatist with idealist tendencies. And for me, the only issue is the Supreme Court. Go through my past comments and you will find a giant list of cases that were decided 5-4 which were harmful to the poor, to minorities, and to the average American and beneficial for the rich and corporations. The Supreme Court is basically all I've talked about since even before Scalia died. Bernie Sander's policies, progressive legislation of the past and future, and essentially everything liberals have fought for since the 1930s is under threat or has already been destroyed by a conservative Supreme Court. Don't give it another 30 years to keep undermining our Democracy.

Go read Sander's book ""An Outsider in the House"" beginning on page 24. Replace ""Bill"" with ""Hillary"" and ""Dick Armey"" with ""Paul Ryan"" and you have Bernie Sanders explaining exactly why I would support a Hillary Presidency if she gets the nomination vs Trump, Cruz (who is the most dangerous of any candidate in decades), John Kasich, or even Paul Ryan. This election is too important for a protest vote for me. So call me a shill for Hillary--I'll keep donating and working for Sanders regardless--but for the love of God, stop posting baseless smear shit like this or you are the same as Rush Limbaugh."

I discriminate as to who my friends are, based on their attitude, appearance, and maybe even a little on their pregnancy status (I believe that having a child, especially at a young age, is stupid, immature, and is a red flag to both employers and *a friend.*). or, **How  is my (private) discrimination of friends any different from my (private) business?** What sets them apart, as both of them are my choices/""property?"""

Not exactly who I'm going to for analysis frankly.

&gt;In the entire forced dump of Clinton’s emails, you will be hard pressed to find a single one sympathetic toward the Jewish state from any of the people she relied on. 

Not really.  I've only read a fraction of them, and I've seen many about what the US needs to do to help Israel.

edit: Notice how the article provides no actual quotes?  They could very easily provide the entire emails themselves to put them in context, but instead just make vague references.

&gt;Sandy Berger was Clinton’s foreign policy adviser during her 2008 presidential campaign. In September of 2010 he sent her ideas on how to pressure Israel to make concessions for peace. Berger acknowledged “how fragile is Abbas’s political position,” and how “Palestinians are in disarray,” and that “failure is a real possibility.” Berger was well aware of, and informed Hillary of, the very real possibility that Israel would be placing its national security at grave risk in a deal that would very likely fail and lead to a Hamas takeover.

&gt;**But Berger felt the risks to Israeli lives were worth it.**

&gt;He advised the need to make Netanyahu feel “uneasy about incurring our displeasure....”

&gt;Berger emphasizes the need “to convince the prime minister – through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure – to make the necessary compromises” and talks of the “possibility – to turn his position against him.”


Sounds like Berger was just talking about standard negotiating?  I notice the point about ""Berger felt the risks to Israel lives were worth it"" isn't an actual quote, unlike the rest. 

edit: [I found the email in question - I don't think the author got the date correct](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_August_Web/IPS-0093/DOC_0C05771036/C05771036.pdf)

&gt;Anne Marie Slaughter was Clinton’s director of policy planning from 2009-2011. She wrote to Clinton in September of 2010 and devised a scheme to encourage wealthy philanthropists to pledge millions to the Palestinians (which no doubt would have been embezzled by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his cronies as were other funds).

&gt;She wrote: “This may be a crazy idea.... Suppose we launched a “Pledge for Palestine” campaign... Such a campaign among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world would reflect a strong vote of confidence in the building of a Palestinian state....”

&gt;She adds: “There would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis who, would be building settlements in the face of a pledge for peace.”

&gt;Clinton’s response to this email: “I am very interested- pls flesh out. Thx.”

[How is this anti-Israel?](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_NovWeb/08627IA2/DOC_0C05775206/C05775206.pdf)

&gt;Robert Russo, one of Clinton’s aides and currently her campaign’s “director of correspondence and briefings” sent an email in April of 2012 informing her of Netanyahu’s father’s death and advising her to give him a condolence call. Included with Russo’s email is an extremely biased article attacking both Netanyahu and his father, describing them as virulently racist warmongers and calling the elder Netanyahu “a behindthe- scenes adviser to his son, the most powerful person in Israel.”

&gt;The article noted that “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly denied that his father was a one-dimensional ideologue. He further emphasized that he himself was a different person from his father.”

&gt;But then it goes on to say, without providing any proof whatsoever, “Israelis seemed in the dark about the extent of paternal influence on their leader,” and “To understand Bibi, you have to understand the father.”

&gt;**One might be forgiven for questioning Clinton’s sympathy and sincerity when she later placed the call and gave Netanyahu her condolences.**

Can we be forgiven for assuming the author is incredibly biased or blatantly misleading?  [The author is bitching about a NYT story (note: wikileaks link)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/4845)

&gt;Thomas Pickering, former US ambassador to Israel, wrote to Clinton on December 18, 2011, and suggested a secret plan to stir up major Palestinian protests in an attempt to force the Israeli government into peace negotiations.

[Decide for yourself.](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_OctWeb/231/DOC_0C05790860/C05790860.pdf)

&gt;This idiotic reasoning that somehow only women would participate and things would stay peaceful is obviously absurd. As Pickering himself notes, “Palestinian men will not for long patiently demonstrate – they will be inclined over time and much too soon to be frustrated and use force. Their male culture comes close to requiring it.”

Pickering *didn't* say that only women would participate - he stressed that it was important that only women should - else it would turn violent."

Vermont has roughly 600k habitants. 

The statistics for rare events in states as small as Vermont have wide confidence intervals. Using only one year to make any kind of statement is misleading. 

For example: 

If the expected incidence of a rare cancer is 1 case per million: a year when 2 cancers happen in Vermont would mean 3.3 cases per million, probably the highest per capita incidence in the US. 

Does that mean that Vermonters are at higher risk of cancer when the next year you may have 0 cases?"
