"45",1460728258,"*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton's decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality.

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](, large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""]( When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this]( article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

> Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
> 
> Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
> 
> 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
> 
> 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders' exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
> 
> 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
> 
> Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts]( and [Wisconsin](, are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](;

> The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it's unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

Local, regional and national parliaments are then divided based on the corresponding voter percentages. No first past the post shit. No gerrymandering shit. No electoral college shit. It's basic and it works because it's damn hard to corrupt it.

The problem is Bernie doesn't want to fully hang the albatross around Hillary's neck, perhaps in deference to the fact that she is likely to be the nominee and will need progressives' support in the general. 

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

"1328",1460652034,"I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons]( In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907]( which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster]( who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](

> We can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man of no capital.

"1593",1460646328,"> On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn't really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

> The easy slogan here is ""Break up the big banks."" It's obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

> Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on ""shadow banks"" like Lehman Brothers that weren't necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts.

Kelly Ayotte, whose home state of New Hampshire is struggling to contain a heroin epidemic.""

>[...]

>In the 1990s, doctors opened up access to opioid painkillers, getting many patients hooked on the drugs. So when officials pulled back access to painkillers, many addicted users didn't just quit the drug; they moved to another opioid, heroin. And now, there are signs that some opioid users are moving on to an opioid that's more powerful and potentially cheaper than painkillers or heroin, fentanyl. And that's all causing more overdose deaths. (For more on the opioid epidemic, check out Vox's explainer.)

>The criminal justice reform bill's solution to this epidemic? A harsher punishment. And that means more nonviolent drug offenders will end up behind bars for long periods of time — particularly for fentanyl.

How is this different than your landlord being forced to open your apartment if you are suspected of committing a crime?  Or a cop breaking down your door because he has a warrant?  Or your bank being forced to disclose transactions that may be related to criminal activity?

I'm all for privacy, but if you commit a crime don't you forfeit that right to some extent?  Shouldn't we, as a society, have some mechanism for catching criminals and enforcing laws?  Why should we make it easier for the outlaws and scumbags of our society to hide their activity?

I understand the client-side encryption angle, but it seems that at the end of the day providers wouldn't be held liable for users implementing features not offered by their service.  It would be like the government suing the telephone company because I used their phone line to deal drugs.  They can ask for and subpoena call logs, but can't sue the phone company for my behavior.

To go out of the country for almost two days just a few days before the NY primary is dumbfounding, especially when Bernie has shown multiple times that the more time he spends campaigning in a state before the voters vote, the better he ends up doing. Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do.

"2247",1460643856,"He better hope the debate ends right on time. 

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him.","Reddit",167,0.568345323741007,22,12.6363636363636,1.31654676258993,1414,1105,7.78835840418574,82.629234793983,3.60958469587966,5.22910927857266,7,6,4.87343361674297,8.50719424460432,7.08712019986064,6.18181818181818,4,6,8.43807152340862,4,260,0.0153846153846154,0.5,0.0555555555555556,0.444444444444444,0,0.444444444444444,0,0.0555555555555556,0.0555555555555556,0.111111111111111,0.166666666666667,0.0555555555555556,0.111111111111111,0.555555555555556

"2308",1460660064,"> Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

> Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren't angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

> Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

> If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he's the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won't do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

> Don't Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job. Let's not make ovaries a requirement of high office--just like we wouldn't make religion or race or whatever.

>The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

"2521",1460647105,"As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result.","Reddit",214,0.524421593830334,21,18.5238095238095,1.40102827763496,2121,1676,11.0084955318888,69.5063410454156,8.12486106010528,7.93518182550025,89,89,8.16641939037826,8.89460154241645,8.93361762163144,10.9285714285714,5,8,10.5042237277757,5,384,0,1.15,0.35,0.9,0.2,0.55,0.2,0.25,0.55,0.4,0.45,0.85,0.5,1.4

I feel like the whole concept of a career is completely changing and my generation won't ever see the kind of working environment that generations before us have. Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily.

"3521",1460607809,"Okay. It is good as the whole build-up to it is ""Save the children!"". But here's why it is not good in the long run. It costs $10,000 just to apply to be a grower. Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

TL;DR Read the fucking thing. It's important!

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

Violence against the police only makes people STOP liking you.  You can get your message heard these days, thanks to mass media and social media, so easily.  But, there is also the side-effect that all the douchey stuff you do becomes noticeable too, on both sides, right away.

Seriously, if any of you are planning on protesting, do it peacefully.  Don't turn into one of those mentally challenged protesters, ""But you're a white male!"" as you scream in someone's face that they can't possibly relate because of that.  As soon as you start blocking ambulances and throwing stuff at police, I instantly think you are a scummy person of low intellectual capacity.

Seriously, think about it for a second, what does blocking an ambulance on the street actually do.  What is the purpose of your protest.  Do you think people are going to become enlightened to your message and flock to you and be inspired by you by doing that?  Now, I assume most of you reading this are reasonably intelligent people to agree with this idea that ya, that is dumb.

Flores is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy, Teachout is running for an open seat vacated by Republicans, and Jayapal is running for an open seat in a safe Democratic district.

"4522",1460564042,"One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

>No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

>Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

>But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

The reason why his 7 state win streak hasn't accounted to a huge change in the race is most of those states are smaller states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming) And the system is rarely a winner take all, and winning by a huge margin in a state worth 20 to 30 delegates isn't worth as much by winning a state worth 300 by the same margin or even a much closer one.  For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

>This interdisciplinary research project will advance basic understanding of how tax compliance behavior emerges by focusing on how perceptions of risk and tax fairness form, how these perceptions spread through a social network, and the interplay caused by the complex feedback loops among individual behaviors and population-level outcomes. The project also will address how audit, penalty, and taxation policies, and changes in those policies, influence perceptions and ultimately reduce tax evasion. The project will provide new insights regarding how tax compliance behavior is modified by the perceived aggregated compliance and on how behavior and the perceived aggregated compliance depend on social network structure over which perceptions of taxation spreads. The project will demonstrate the utility of the use of agent-based modeling for research on interactions between individuals and governments as well as how data from the American Life Panel collected by Rand Corporation can be employed to address problems like this. The analysis also will have practical utility, because it will shed light on why certain countries with high taxation levels, such as Scandinavian nations, can maintain high levels of tax compliance while other countries with lower taxation levels may have high levels of tax evasion as is the case in Greece and Italy. Project findings therefore should help nations like the United States reduce the occurrence of tax evasion.

>Income tax evasion is a problem that poses considerable challenges for tax authorities and governments at the local, state, and federal levels. Its causes and implications are both economic and social. The role of tax evasion-related perceptions and how social networks influence those perceptions remain poorly understood, however. The investigators will build an agent-based computational simulation model of income tax evasion. Within the simulation, the compliance behavior of individuals will change through an adaptation process based on their past experiences with audits and tax evasion penalties, their perception of the fairness in taxation rates, and social interactions with people in their social networks. In conjunction, the investigators will conduct a national survey on the perceptions of tax fairness. The survey will gather individual-level data that will inform the simulation model's behavioral mechanisms. These mechanisms influence the propensity to evade, and the survey provides an empirical basis for choosing model-specific parameter values. Model assumptions will further be informed using sensitivity analyses. The simulation model will be validated and calibrated to reproduce U.S. national levels of income tax compliance for different tax brackets. In addition to the U.S., the model also will be calibrated using data sets and compliance levels for Greece and Denmark. Once calibrated, the model will be used to understand how tax evasion behaviors evolve differently depending on various starting assumptions, such as how social networks are structured or what fiscal policies are in place and the conditions for the system to produce tipping point dynamics. The model then will be used to identify fiscal policies that are most effective in minimize tax evasion and recovering compliance. The investigators will employ robust decision making, a method for improving policy decision making, to rank policies based both on their potential performance, as well as how robust this performance is to the key sources of uncertainty. This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.

Of course the dimwitted among us will rush to say ""of course we know why people cheat on their taxes - they don't want to pay money.""  But that is a pretty dumb answer.

>>[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

>>Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

"5634",1460558032,"Goldman admitted to fraud, which largely contributed to the destruction of our economy.

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

>Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

>Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

>Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

>Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

>Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel Transaction. The 2014 effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone's noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership prior to the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

[Death Squads Are Back in Honduras, Activists Tell Congress](

>Bertha Oliva compared the current situation to the early 1980s, when the CIA funded, armed, and trained Honduran government death squads that murdered hundreds of opposition activists.

and:
>""When we first began in 1982, we faced death squads,"" said Oliva, also speaking through a translator. ""Now, it's like going back to the past. We know there are death squads in Honduras.""

also:
>The coup was accompanied by a huge rise in political violence. By 2012, state security forces had assassinated more than 300 people, and 34 members of the opposition and 13 journalists had disappeared, according to data compiled by Honduran human rights organizations. The political assassinations added to the emboldened violence from gangs and drug traffickers, making Honduras one of the most dangerous countries in the world. In 2012, Reuters reported that it had the highest murder rate of any country.

>Although the murder rate has since declined, political violence in Honduras has continued. Since the end of 2012, at least 22 prominent environmental activists have been killed, according to Global Witness.

Put more simply, if it's not windy, you need to have enough fossil fuel plants to serve the full public demand.   

Therefore, whatever the cost of wind is, it is almost entirely in addition to the cost of fossil fuel power generation.

"6000",1460473907,"There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

>Clinton: Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-à-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs.

And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime.

>Filler:So you wouldn't say don't do it, you would say do it right.

The reality is that you can't teach students that have such a range of ability level. It is just as ridiculous to expect a low achieving students to be able to do the same as a high achieving student ( or intelligent, a word you may never use in the educational system as eveeybody is the same apparently) as it is to expect a 5ft 60lbs girl to wrestle a 6ft 200lbs guy and be competitive. People are limited by their abilities; a good teacher, like a sports coach may have a 10% impact but it can't make a weak student strong. It is ridiculous to hold teachers or schools  accountable for the grades of their students. At our school, we have a large number of immigrants who barely speak english. Their score count the same as those of native speakers. It is all part of the American notion that everybody can achieve anything as long as they work hard. This is high,y naive: students can reach the goals they set for themselves, based on their interests and ability by working hard.
The downside of the European system is that it creates a class society where people at a young age are labeled and start acting and oerforming accordingly. Also, the level of the teachers at the lower level schools is lower because frankly most teachers don't want to work there, because of the behavioral issues. The other downside is that it is negatively biased towards boys, who tend to be behind in development and organizational skills, compared to their female peers. I know tons of freshmen that would have been put in the lower level schools because they can't even bring a pencil with them, who turned out responsible and dilligent seniors a few years later.

"6187",1460484621,"It's pretty rare for any Democrat [politicians] to discuss firearms publicly and not lie. Some do it because they simply parrot the Democrat propaganda. Others, like Clinton, do it because they knowingly push propaganda to facilitate their idealogical agenda.

The real crime is that anyone listens to anything any Democrat has to say on firearms and firearms policy. As a matter of course, the standard assumption is that everything they say is dishonest or at best a half-truth. Sadly, this is not a hyperbolic statement or exaggeration in any way. Which is especially frustrating because there are so many very knowledgeable people who know law, Constitution, research studies, and history, who can accurately discuss public policy and even societal root causes. Heck, a huge number of laymen know the subject matter far, far better than most Democrats attempting to make public policy and law. Take time to ponder that.

To give you an idea of how completely backwards political arena is on firearms, consider the following. When people want expert opinion, they go to experts. When Democrats want expert opinion on firearms and policy, they go to politicians. Which is painfully obvious why, as the experts contradict just about everything Democrat politicians have to say on the subject. Which brings us full circle to my opening sentence.

"6188",1460477183,"So Vermont definitely has issues with guns leaving their state illegally. This wasn't a very strong attack because it doesn't apply to New York in the same numbers. But Vermont is *per-capita* responsible for the most guns recovered in other states in general. 



>Her statistics come from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issued a report in 2013 saying **Vermont was in fact, adjusted for population, the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states.** That year, 23.5 guns per 100,000 residents, or a total of 147, were recovered in crimes committed outside of Vermont. The next-highest per capita state was New Hampshire, with 22.3 guns per 100,000 residents.

>An ATF report from 2014 put Vermont in the top 15 states whose guns were recovered in New York. Still, it's worth noting that guns from Vermont are just a tiny fraction of the overall number of out-of-state guns recovered there: that year, Vermont's guns were 55 of the total 4,585 out-of-state guns. In the same year Georgia was the source for 386 out-of-state guns and 395 were traced to Virginia.

Here is her quote- ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest **per capita** number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""

So she was wrong about the New York part. But it is true that per- capita, Vermont is the number one source of guns recovered in other states.

If anything, giving politicians and the democratic party MORE money from such groups is exacerbating an already existing problem. They will be knocking on doors for favors once elections are done.

Also, why do you think doing the same strategy of fundraising that's lost us both sides of congress, as well as numerous gubernatorial and legislative branches across the nation, will suddenly start to win?

Corporations employ tons of people. What do you think will happen if we tax them more? Not to mention, several corporations operate at a loss or break even.

""Instead of condemning the figures behind the uprising, suspending support to the illegitimate government of Zelaya's successor, Roberto Micheletti, and demanding a restoration of the democratically elected Zelaya, Secretary Clinton decided to move on. In her memoir ""Hard Choices,"" Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region ""to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot."" The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya's ouster.""

So is it fair to ask questions of why she didn't do more?  Sure.  Is it correct to say there was a coup we supported?  Only in the fevered imaginings of Bernie and Trump supporters.

Sorry but when you are a president you are supposed to be the leader and others should follow you and not the other way around. This is something I miss in Hillary. She hardly ever takes the initiative and just goes with the flow (also applicable on her stands towards most important progressive topics). 

Another trait of a good leader is taking the blame when it is yours to take and not blame somebody else for the mistakes you made! Yesterday in debate you could clearly see she that she doesn't understand this (she solely blamed Obama for some mistakes she was as much responsible for.

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window. I highly doubt that a candidate like Clinton will be elected again, but who knows

1.) to keep the pressure on and keep talking about these subjects and not let the media push them into the shadows again.
2.) to aggressively challenge any and all voter dis-enfranchisements. Voting should be a constitutional right! Americans should have the right to vote in a fair process free of party corruptions, free of gerrymandering, and free of false choices between 'lesser of two evils'. How to accomplish that technically?

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.  
e.) All states should switch to vote by mail.
f.) Each ballot should have a durable carbon copy record for auditing purposes that shall remain legible at least 10 years in the humid Southeast.
g.) Vote tallying or counting machines must be audited regularly and rigorously using statistical sampling.

>What you see, on this as on multiple issues, is the casual adoption, with no visible effort to check the premises, of a story line that sounds good. It's all about the big banks; single-payer is there for the taking if only we want it; government spending will yield huge payoffs — not the more modest payoffs conventional Keynesian analysis suggests; Republican support will vanish if we take on corporate media.

>In each case the story runs into big trouble if you do a bit of homework; if not completely wrong, it needs a lot of qualification. But the all-purpose response to anyone who raises questions is that she or he is a member of the establishment, personally corrupt, etc.. Ad hominem attacks aren't a final line of defense, they're argument .

>I know some people think that I'm obsessing over trivial policy details, but they're missing the point. *It's about an attitude, the sense that righteousness excuses you from the need for hard thinking and that any questioning of the righteous is treason to the cause.* **When you see Sanders supporters going over the top about ""corporate whores"" and such, you're not seeing a mysterious intrusion of bad behavior into an idealistic movement; you're seeing the intolerance that was always just under the surface of the movement, right from the start.**

I started out as neutral. I'm not American and I like to watch American politics from afar because I don't have to get emotionally invested and I don't have to eventually pick a side. But then the Sanders supporters got just so very toxic.

**Sanders supporters, you need to pay attention to this:** Your movement is toxic. You've taken it and tarnished it and smeared shit all over it. You've treated everyone who wasn't a True Believer in Bernie Sanders like a pariah, or like they're an evil paid corporate shill. You've acted like condescending assholes that nobody wants to associate with.

You will look back on this one day and you will cringe with embarrassment. You will get involved more deeply in politics one day and you will realize that your actions helped strangle Bernie Sanders's presidential bid in its cradle. You will look back at this and realize that you acted completely contrary to how people need to act in politics to win supporters.

"17496",1460004685,"Well, in point of fact, the US did not buy Alaska from Russia. They gave Russia a cheque for a specious claim and threatened Britain to secede its claim just a few months prior to Canadian Confederation. The cheque did not buy the land. To be clear, it was a gift to Russia in exchange for a political justification to a land claim.

The Brits gave up rights when the US pressed a claim which was not valid. If the US had not arranged a bogus purchase then Alaska would have been a part of Canada and a new war would have resulted if the US pushed a claim after confederation. 

That said, Alaska is now undeniably a state of the US, just as Hawaii is. The issue of independence is not about money. People in Alaska and Hawaii want more local autonomy just as the provinces of Alberta, BC, and Quebec do. As a Canadian living in Alberta, I'm of the opinion that the structure of politics and autonomy in Canada needs to change. 

I suspect many of the people of Alaska and Hawaii think in the same way. Unfortunately I don't see how they can press their claim without personal cost.

It's a side effect of the presidency and first-past-the-post voting for Congress.  Because you can only vote for one candidate, people tend to pick one of the two most viable candidates.  If you pick a less viable candidate, then you can be almost certain that your vote won't count.  This is called Duverger's Law.  

It would be possible for regional parties to develop.  For example, the California Democrats could fracture into moderates and liberals.  The moderates might replace the current Republican party in California.  However, in some states, this would mean choosing between voting in the primaries for a presidential candidate and local candidates (Congress, state legislature, etc.).  

Note that other countries with first-past-the-post voting have parliamentary systems where it's easier for parties to compete regionally.  Alliances can be made after the election to determine a prime minister.  Whereas in a presidential system, the president is elected as part of the election.  

If you wanted to change this behavior in the US, you would want to either eliminate the presidency or implement ranked voting.  Either of those things would make it less important that there are only two viable candidates.  

Note that proportional electors without ranked voting would increase the chances that the House of Representatives would choose the President.  That's the backup plan if no one gets a majority of the electors (270).  Obviously three or more candidates with electors increases the chance that there won't be a majority winner.  With just two, that can only happen with a tie.

Even when a petition reaches the required number of signatures, the petition committee of the parliament will only consider putting it up for debate in parliament. 
Being put up for debate means just that: the parliament will have a discussion about it, nothing more. It does not mean that any MP will consider turning it into a proper act to vote on. 
And even when someone decides to do that, the parliament will vote on it as usual and can decide to dismiss it.


By the way, demanding a new general election because people are unhappy with the prime minister does not make much sense, because the prime minister is not elected by the general public. The general public vote the members of the parliament and then the parliament decides who becomes prime minister (technically the monarch decides, but practically they always pick the one the parliament wants). So when the UK public wants a new prime minister, they should petition the parliament to ask the queen to appoint someone else. A reelection does not necessarily reach that goal because the new parliament could just pick the same prime minister again.

1- Yousef Yemen 's map is more accurate.

2- They are not allies but they have common interests. Some of common interests:
(i) Iran suffers US hostility which results UN sanctions. Russia can help Iran in the case: 1- Russia can soften severity of sanctions. 2- Iran need to have some technologies (e.g. atomic reactors) that only can deal with Russia in the absence of US (and Consequently EU). In this deal Russia, also, have many benefits. A big market with no rivals.
(ii) Iran and Syrian Government have cooperation against Israel. Russia has naval facility in Tartus. Both Iran and Russia are cautious about changing regime. I believe both want the change be gradual and the new regime were not US ally.
(iii) As Yousef Yemen says Soviet Union suffered very heavy losses from terrorist (which are Sunni Wahhabi). Usually Shiites dont Commit self-willed actions, because they believe that any fight must be with order of top religious scholar. Almost all Shiites top religious scholars knows killing people  against ""Sharia"". This even include infidels until they start fight with Muslims or occupy their land (today only fight with Israel is legal by this sentence). Spreading Shiites thought can help Russia in this case.  

3- It is not true that ""Putin together with Shiites is fighting against Sunnites"".
The problem here, for Iran, is Israel. Iran knows Israel as enemy, as I explained in 2(iii). Then Iran is friend of all Muslims that are against Israel in the scope of Sharia. So Iran support both Hezbollah (Shiite) and Hamas (Sunni).

"17631",1460225871,"Short answer: The well-being of the public.  For wide-ranging interpretations of well-being, and possibly of public.

The short answer is imprecise, but it's about as close as we can get.  Philosophers have tried to tackle this question as far back in history as democracies have been founded.  To answer with more context, we need to establish a common parlance on what we consider a politician, and make some assumptions on what we could defend to be their intended purpose.


  ""A politician (from Classical Greek πόλις, ""polis"") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek positions within a government through elections or appointment."" — Wikipedia: Politician
  
  ""Politics (from Greek: πολιτικός politikos, definition ""of, for, or relating to citizens"") is the making of a common decision for a group of people, that is, a uniform decision applying in the same way to all members of the group. It also involves the use of power by one person to affect the behavior of another person. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities."" — Wikipedia: Politics


So, a politician is someone who holds or seeks to hold a position of governance, and one who influences public policy.  Note that this does not imply or require a democracy; royalty, dictators, and warlords are also politicians in this sense.  This is as far as we get in commonalities between politicians and a joint purpose.

If we go from the charitable assumption that the well-being of the public is the end goal of politics, that still doesn't get us much further than just that assumption.  After all, depending on your value system, your morality and ethics, any of the following is defensible:


The view that public well-being is best served through a single, overarching faith or belief system, fostering a sense of community and limiting internal conflict.
The view that public well-being is best served through freedom of faith, promoting individual freedom and diversity.


Without arguing about viability or desirability of these views, they are defensible and largely incompatible.

Personally, I stick with my short answer up top: that politicians should pursue the well-being of the public as a kind of ""greater good,"" and I believe this may be about as close to a consensus view as we are likely to find, and as far as we can venture without wading into specific policies.

Various regions of the UK have rejected elected assemblies, while London, Scotland and Wales seemed to fairly enthusiastically embraced theirs. A lot of the debate seems to relate to different groups arguing over whether different layers (for us it goes from parish councils, to district, county, sometimes a regional assembly, national parliament, EU then in some ways the UN) can make useful decisions for their area of influence or will just be ""talking shops"".

Is there an analysis anywhere of how existing multilayered systems share their powers and, more speculatively, what an efficient distribution from the most local to the most global might be?

While the rules do not explicitly require official membership or registration in the party, the petition signature requirements may do so. States may require that voters in a primary be registered for a specific party (as in Maryland), but some states have ""open"" primaries.

Marylandprimary ballot for example does not seem to address the membership of the candidate in the party for which he is campaigning.


  For principal party candidates
  
  A candidate for federal, statewide or state legislative office seeking
  the nomination of a principal political party in a primary election
  must submit to the Maryland State Board of Elections a certificate of
  candidacy, which notes the office being sought, the year of the
  election, the name and address of the candidate, and includes a
  statement verifying that the candidate satisfies the legal
  requirements for candidacy for the office being sought. A candidate
  for statewide or state legislative office must also submit a financial
  disclosure form to the Maryland State Ethics Commission.[4][5]


Kansas also appears to have similar rules.


  For party candidates
  
  See statutes: Kansas Statutes, Chapter 25, Article 2,
  Section 5
  
  A candidate seeking the nomination of a party qualified to participate
  in primary elections can gain access to the primary ballot in one of
  two ways. These are detailed below. By filing a nomination petition
  
  Signature requirements for nomination petitions for party candidates
  vary according to the office being sought. For offices elected on a
  statewide basis, signatures must equal at least 1 percent of the
  state's current voter registration total of the party whose nomination
  the candidate is seeking. Gubernatorial candidates must collect
  signatures equaling at least 1 percent of the total votes cast for the
  party's candidate for secretary of state at the last preceding
  election. For offices elected by district, signatures must equal at
  least 2 percent of the district's current voter registration total of
  the party whose nomination the candidate is seeking.[2][3]
  
  Nomination petitions for federal and state-level offices (including
  state legislative seats) must be submitted to the Kansas Secretary of
  State by noon on June 1, prior to the primary election. If June 1
  falls on a holiday or weekend, petitions are due by noon on the next
  following business day.[2] By paying a filing fee
  
  A candidate may forgo the petition process by submitting a declaration
  of candidacy and paying a filing fee. The filing fee varies according
  to the office being sought. For statewide and federal offices, the fee
  is equal to 1 percent of the office's annual salary. For state senate
  candidates, the fee is $75. For state representative candidates, the
  fee is $50.[2][4]
  
  The declaration and accompanying filing fee for federal and
  state-level offices (including state legislative seats) must be
  submitted to the Kansas Secretary of State by noon on June 1, prior to
  the primary election. If June 1 falls on a holiday or weekend,
  petitions are due by noon on the next following business day.[2]
  
  In addition to the statutory filing fee, a candidate for federal and
  state offices must pay a $20 administrative fee to the Kansas
  Secretary of State. A state-level candidate must also pay a
  registration fee to the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission. For
  statewide executive offices, the fee is $480. For state legislative
  candidates, the fee is $35.[5][6]

  However, I can't find where the states are actually required to have a legislature in the first place, and what qualifies as a ""legislature"" (are democratic elections required?). Where is this specified?


It isn't specified.  Whether or not a democratic election is required is largely untested, although the ""One Person One Vote"" principle implies democratic elections are required based on Section 2 of the 14th amendment.  Section 4 of Article IV of the constitution says that it must be a republican government.  

There was a recent Supreme Court decision that allowed states to delegate redistricting power to a commission, even though that is supposed to be a power of the state legislature.  Under that theory, any law making assembly would be sufficient if it is part of a republican government.

That vote has been disputed as not being legal by many countries, however those same countries all supported internal votes to break up Yugoslavia, so the opposition is not to such an event in principle, but rather on very fine points of law as to when and how such votes can be made. In Canada there have been similar legal discussions on the process for a possible Quebec seccession for example.

In the US there is the debate as to whether Puerto Rico should be allowed to become a full state - also illustrating that such things need widespread agreement from all parties concerned as in Puerto Rico the desire for full statehood has established by referendum in 2012 where 54% stated their desire to end their current status as a protectorate and 61% who marked their preferred option selected statehood.
