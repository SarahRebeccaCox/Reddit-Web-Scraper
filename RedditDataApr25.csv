You make it sound like maybe *we're* the ones who didn't enforce the rules, and sold the entire forum out to a group of Sanders fanatics.

But that wasn't us.  It was you.  For months, you allowed them to spam multiple links to the same articles, write their own headlines, brigade-downvote any dissenting opinion, and generally behave like the rules didn't apply to them.

...because the rules didn't.

We didn't do this.  **You**, the Mods, did this.  You could have stopped it at any time, but you didn't.  In fact, to a lot of us, it looked like you were encouraging it.

And to be honest, it seems a little suspicious to me that you've only decided to have a newfound interest in enforcing the rules on the day after Sanders is out of the race.

**The problem, Mods, is that you've already let it go too far.** You let the Sanders supporters insult, attack, and Brigade the rest of us for so long that we are legitimately pissed off about it.  Yes, many of us are using the Clinton win as an excuse to attack the Bernie Bros.  But **it's you, the Mods**, who let them run amok for so long that this kind of payback was inevitable.  **If you'd stopped them from spamming, mass-downvoting, Brigading, and posting complete falsehoods and conspiracy theory bullshit, we would not currently be in this situation.**

So stop acting like we caused /r/politics to become the shithole it is today.  It's exactly the kind of /sub the Mods allowed it to become."

Also, what about the amount of vitriol spend by people on this sub towards users? RThis has been a problem for months now, yet only now mods are reaching out even though plenty of users have been bashed and harassed in the comments before last week?

That site was never put up until this election...so to say you want to intelligently talk about information regardless of site is a lie.

This subreddit has been pushing an agenda for the last 6 months.  To talk about shills in here is a complete joke because you guys have been shills (unpaid, I would hope) for the Sanders campaign.  Allowing multiple articles of the same pro-Sanders messages to be ok and then becoming super mods when it was anything positive about Clinton.

This sub is a disaster for intelligent conversation and it is 100% your fault.  To think that suddenly just recently this place has become bad shows how you all should be removed and replaced with more neutral minded people who encourage supporting political discussion rather than a pro-Sanders page.

/r/politics used to be left-leaning, I'll give you that. It became a place that was inhospitable if you weren't a rabid Sanders supporters. And not to mention the amount of duplicates that weren't culled when he won a caucus state by 40 points.

Also... **I am not a Shill.**

I have been called such for saying remotely positive stuff about Clinton. **I did have a long break from politics.** I'm typically only involved in politics during election seasons. I have seen people call me a shill because my interests go from NFL and fantasy football to politics suddenly towards the latter part of last year... it's because the political season got started and I got really interested. For those of you that don't recognize me, I run Benchmark Politics and do live updates for /r/politics live threads often. I have been even handed on both candidates and have been trashed when calling states for Clinton here, even though when I call a state for Sanders, I get a few hundred upvotes... just that in and of itself illustrates the ""downvote"" problem mentioned in this top post.

It's hardly unique to reddit. But it's not even shilling that is the issue; theoretically, you could have a paid person that writes effectively and fairly and is open to discussion - meanwhile, you have an entire hive-mind street mob of volunteers that are happy to take advantage of the commercial shilling by repeating the shilling by hurling around every nasty verbal weapon they can, without engaging in much meaningful discussion. I am convinced that the anti-Obama hatred that has been spread on the Internet for the past 8 years has been mostly paid for, just by watching patterns on different websites; it has been outrageous and has hurt America, without even benefitting the groups who pay for it. Meanwhile, of course not every anti-Obama commenter is paid. They just join in on the hate. It's very, very much like climate denialism and certain political positions I see promoted on reddit.

Popular is not always right. Every meta thread the same suggestions are made. Limit submissions to only reputable sites. Limit multiple posts about same thing. Etc.

For those of you that don't recognize me, I run Benchmark Politics and do live updates for /r/politics live threads often.

It's hardly unique to reddit. But it's not even shilling that is the issue; theoretically, you could have a paid person that writes effectively and fairly and is open to discussion - meanwhile, you have an entire hive-mind street mob of volunteers that are happy to take advantage of the commercial shilling by repeating the shilling by hurling around every nasty verbal weapon they can, without engaging in much meaningful discussion. I am convinced that the anti-Obama hatred that has been spread on the Internet for the past 8 years has been mostly paid for, just by watching patterns on different websites; it has been outrageous and has hurt America, without even benefitting the groups who pay for it. Meanwhile, of course not every anti-Obama commenter is paid. They just join in on the hate. It's very, very much like climate denialism and certain political positions I see promoted on reddit.

This subreddit has been pushing an agenda for the last 6 months.  To talk about shills in here is a complete joke because you guys have been shills (unpaid, I would hope) for the Sanders campaign.  Allowing multiple articles of the same pro-Sanders messages to be ok and then becoming super mods when it was anything positive about Clinton.

This sub is a disaster for intelligent conversation and it is 100% your fault.  To think that suddenly just recently this place has become bad shows how you all should be removed and replaced with more neutral minded people who encourage supporting political discussion rather than a pro-Sanders page.

It's the ridiculousness of the sub and its moderation that encourage the trolls here.  Open up the echo chamber to more diverse points of view and it will improve the sub."

I have been called such for saying remotely positive stuff about Clinton. **I did have a long break from politics.** I'm typically only involved in politics during election seasons. I have seen people call me a shill because my interests go from NFL and fantasy football to politics suddenly towards the latter part of last year... it's because the political season got started and I got really interested. For those of you that don't recognize me, I run Benchmark Politics and do live updates for /r/politics live threads often. I have been even handed on both candidates and have been trashed when calling states for Clinton here, even though when I call a state for Sanders, I get a few hundred upvotes... just that in and of itself illustrates the ""downvote"" problem mentioned in this top post.

It's hardly unique to reddit. But it's not even shilling that is the issue; theoretically, you could have a paid person that writes effectively and fairly and is open to discussion - meanwhile, you have an entire hive-mind street mob of volunteers that are happy to take advantage of the commercial shilling by repeating the shilling by hurling around every nasty verbal weapon they can, without engaging in much meaningful discussion. I am convinced that the anti-Obama hatred that has been spread on the Internet for the past 8 years has been mostly paid for, just by watching patterns on different websites; it has been outrageous and has hurt America, without even benefitting the groups who pay for it. Meanwhile, of course not every anti-Obama commenter is paid. They just join in on the hate. It's very, very much like climate denialism and certain political positions I see promoted on reddit.

"232","1461607124","Fun fact: Jefferson was very good friends with Tadeusz Kościuszko, a polish emigre who fought for the continental army during the American revolution, and who subsequently went on to help write the first continental european constitution in Poland (which was quickly trounced by the invasion of Russia, Prussia, and Austria-hungary to carve it up). 

In his will, Kościuszko left his whole estate and back pay from fighting in the American revolution under the trust of Jefferson, under the direct order that the money would be used to free black slaves and educate them to have a full life of their own. Jefferson later claimed old age and inability to execute the will.....So even though Jefferson called him ""He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known"" he died without being able to see liberty restored to his native country or the freedom given to the slaves he wanted set free. "
"233","1461636783","An interesting note about Jefferson's presidency is who he asked to be the first Governor of the newly acquired Louisiana Territory (for an interesting perspective on how Jefferson came to make this transaction, Mike Duncan's Revolutions podcast just finished up on the Haitian Revolution which plays into this). Jefferson asked his old friend from the American Revolution and from his time as Ambassador to France - Lafayette.

While Jefferson was in France during the summer of 1789 the French Revolution was just beginning. The National Assembly was created from the Estates-General in June - with Liberal Nobles like Lafayette leading the way for the estates to join together in one body. Lafayette worked with Jefferson to draft what would become the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen, which was oddly written at the same time with the similarly organized and bodies American Bill of Rights primarily by ... James Madison! Jefferson brought with him the Virginian Bill of Rights (by George Mason) and his own Declaration of Independence to help craft the language, and the two used the works of Enlightenment greats like Montesquieu, Locke, Voltaire, and Paine (who, oddly enough, had a seat in the successor to the National Assembly) to craft the document. If you read over it, you'll see a lot of similarities between it and these other documents. The first draft was presented a few days before the storming of the Bastille, which was immediately followed by Lafayette being made the leader of the National Guard (1788-1791 is probably his height in the Revolution) - giving him more clout to get it passed in August of that year.

Today, the Declaration is included as the preamble to the French Constitution and laws and regulations have been overturned by the French courts for non-compliance with the Declaration. Yes, that means the words of Jefferson have constitutional weight in France. The Declaration along with the American Declaration and Bill of Rights all served as a big basis for the 1948 UN Declaration drafted in part by Eleanor Roosevelt (who I'm sure we'll get to talk about during the FDR spotlight). To recap, that's Lafayette, Jefferson, and Madison respectively. Only one of those men isn't a US President being covered this week.

So back to Louisiana. Let's say Lafayette had taken up Jefferson on his offer. Maryland has already made him a natural-born citizen of the state. This means, by the Constitution, he was eligible to run for US President. With being the Hero of Two Worlds and Governor of Louisiana by his point, it's not out of the realm of reason that he could've been thrust into a presidential campaign and won the presidency. What an interesting piece of history that could've been...

One last interesting Lafayette fact (there are so many) before I wrap up this post, related to him refusing offices. In 1830 during the July Revolution, the Chamber of Deputies attempted to proclaim the 70-year-old Marquis as the King of France to replace the abdicated Charles. He refused as such an act would be unconstitutional and could lead down a path of the worst parts of the 1789 revolution, and instead backed the Duc d'Orleans, Louis-Philippe, as the new King. Again, quite a different time line we could've had."

"254","1461607124","Fun fact: Jefferson was very good friends with Tadeusz Kościuszko, a polish emigre who fought for the continental army during the American revolution, and who subsequently went on to help write the first continental european constitution in Poland (which was quickly trounced by the invasion of Russia, Prussia, and Austria-hungary to carve it up). 

In his will, Kościuszko left his whole estate and back pay from fighting in the American revolution under the trust of Jefferson, under the direct order that the money would be used to free black slaves and educate them to have a full life of their own. Jefferson later claimed old age and inability to execute the will.....So even though Jefferson called him ""He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known"" he died without being able to see liberty restored to his native country or the freedom given to the slaves he wanted set free. "
"255","1461636783","An interesting note about Jefferson's presidency is who he asked to be the first Governor of the newly acquired Louisiana Territory (for an interesting perspective on how Jefferson came to make this transaction, Mike Duncan's Revolutions podcast just finished up on the Haitian Revolution which plays into this). Jefferson asked his old friend from the American Revolution and from his time as Ambassador to France - Lafayette.

While Jefferson was in France during the summer of 1789 the French Revolution was just beginning. The National Assembly was created from the Estates-General in June - with Liberal Nobles like Lafayette leading the way for the estates to join together in one body. Lafayette worked with Jefferson to draft what would become the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen, which was oddly written at the same time with the similarly organized and bodies American Bill of Rights primarily by ... James Madison! Jefferson brought with him the Virginian Bill of Rights (by George Mason) and his own Declaration of Independence to help craft the language, and the two used the works of Enlightenment greats like Montesquieu, Locke, Voltaire, and Paine (who, oddly enough, had a seat in the successor to the National Assembly) to craft the document. If you read over it, you'll see a lot of similarities between it and these other documents. The first draft was presented a few days before the storming of the Bastille, which was immediately followed by Lafayette being made the leader of the National Guard (1788-1791 is probably his height in the Revolution) - giving him more clout to get it passed in August of that year.

Today, the Declaration is included as the preamble to the French Constitution and laws and regulations have been overturned by the French courts for non-compliance with the Declaration. Yes, that means the words of Jefferson have constitutional weight in France. The Declaration along with the American Declaration and Bill of Rights all served as a big basis for the 1948 UN Declaration drafted in part by Eleanor Roosevelt (who I'm sure we'll get to talk about during the FDR spotlight). To recap, that's Lafayette, Jefferson, and Madison respectively. Only one of those men isn't a US President being covered this week.

So back to Louisiana. Let's say Lafayette had taken up Jefferson on his offer. Maryland has already made him a natural-born citizen of the state. This means, by the Constitution, he was eligible to run for US President. With being the Hero of Two Worlds and Governor of Louisiana by his point, it's not out of the realm of reason that he could've been thrust into a presidential campaign and won the presidency. What an interesting piece of history that could've been...

One last interesting Lafayette fact (there are so many) before I wrap up this post, related to him refusing offices. In 1830 during the July Revolution, the Chamber of Deputies attempted to proclaim the 70-year-old Marquis as the King of France to replace the abdicated Charles. He refused as such an act would be unconstitutional and could lead down a path of the worst parts of the 1789 revolution, and instead backed the Duc d'Orleans, Louis-Philippe, as the new King. Again, quite a different time line we could've had."

These are the examples the FEC provides in its own[ handbook for federal candidates](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/candgui.pdf) [pdf] as examples of ""campaigning"" 

&gt;Certain activities, however, indicate that the individual
has decided to become a candidate and is
no longer testing the waters. In that case, once the
individual has raised or spent more than $5,000,
he or she must register as a candidate. Note that,
when an individual decides to run for office, funds
that were raised and spent to test the waters apply
to the $5,000 threshold.

&gt;Campaigning (as opposed to testing the waters) is
apparent, for example, when individuals:

&gt;•	 Make or authorize statements that refer to
themselves as candidates (“Smith in 2016” or
“Smith for Senate”);

&gt;•	 Use general public political advertising to
publicize their intention to campaign;

&gt;•	 Raise more money than what is reasonably
needed to test the waters or amass funds
(seed money) to be used after candidacy is
established;

&gt;•	 Conduct activities over a protracted period
of time or shortly before the election; or

&gt;•	 Take action to qualify for the ballot.

&gt;Also, once an individual files FEC Form 2, Statement
of Candidacy, he or she is no longer considered to
be “testing the waters” and must file FEC Form 1
(and subsequently file financial reports) under the
rules described in Chapter 2, “Starting the Campaign.”

The cut-off for all states to switch should be something like... 2 weeks before the primary or maybe even 1 week and as the government catches up in terms of technology... maybe event he day before.

The reason I think all primaries should be closed is that you chose to either align yourself with a party or you chose to keep yourself unaligned(independent). If the party you chose to align yourself with has a primary to decide the best candidate to represent that party... only members who chose to align themselves with that party should have a say in who that is.

If the members do not have the foresight to chose a candidate who might appeal to non-party members... that is their choice. It is not non-party member's choice to say who their favorite candidate is within a party.

If you chose to be independent, to me you are saying that you don't want to be a part of the party's BAU. And choosing a candidate is BAU stuff. If you want to influence a party, join the party... it is the best way to make your voice heard. That is what Bernie did, you can do it too."

-
Noam Chomsky is a professor at MIT, has written numerous rigorously-researched and overwhelmingly praised books; he's one of the most cited scholars in history.  He's a thoughtful intellectual and academic, and he makes really good points, if you actually take the time to read or listen to him (I sincerely doubt anyone who disrespects Chomsky like that has read any of his work).  
  
-
This isn't like saying 'oh who cares what Glenn Beck says, he's just a right wing blowhard.' Chomsky isn't some trite pundit. He's one of the most respected minds in the world, literally. Have some class, guys."

"480","1461856704","This is a case of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"". Fundamentally their ideologies do not align. Chomsky has gone on record saying that ideologically he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism or libertarian Socialism, which is to say that a state that favors the working class cannot exist, but will only serve to enrich themselves at the cost of the worker. Sanders believes that a politically Democratic society can exist alongside a fiscally Marxist one. To understand why this isn't too far removed from Marxism, you must understand the difference between a democracy and a republic. They are both populist but in a democracy the government is entitled to privacy/rights/protection and the people have to be transparent with everything they do while in a republic those roles are inverted. I am a Trump supporter, and I will say I'm not afraid of Sanders. What I am afraid of is that the stage is being set for the US to be taken over by a true Marxist mindset in the near future. We need to be well educated as to what lines are okay to cross, and which ones aren't, and as for the Bernie supporters, I do not feel this is being considered."

Of course a simpler explanation is not that X causes Y, but more likely that Y was already Y to begin with. 

In other words, instead of believing some grand conspiracy that supposes the higher education system is a sinister and effective brainwashing apparatus: a more plausible reality is simply that Americans are as a whole are more self-identifying as left leaning. Masters degree here, but I identified as left leaning before I entered undergraduate, and was left leaning before I entered graduate school. I don't recall anti-Reagan propaganda coming from my advanced research courses, quantitative analysis courses, or finance courses. Didn't learn about pro-Clinton/Carter propaganda from my IT courses or program management courses. I was left leaning before ever enrolling in anything.

I can understand that many students may be persuaded to move to the left through indoctrination.

However, I also notice that people really should move to the left more through education. This doesn't mean people should necessarily become Democrat, but a formal education, particularly college, will reveal a lot of issues that most people probably have no clue about and learning about these things will likely cause people to move to the left, even just a little bit."

&gt;""I think Iraq is a terrible mistake,"" Trump said. ""And to think that when we leave, it’s gonna be this nice democratic country. I mean, give me a break. There’s usually a reason why a country is run a certain way.""

&gt;Trump amplified on that in an August 2004 article in Esquire:

&gt;""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have.

&gt;""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!""

Trump said, ""I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East."" 

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but it seems like he never said he was against it before the war started and that's just how politifact interpreted the quote."
"665","1461810201","Trump says he opposed the war for years. Politifact interprets this to mean he opposed it from the beginning, and rates it false based on a quote from a Howard Stern interview. Can someone please explain how they reached that conclusion? "

"670","1461832973","&gt;On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.

&gt;Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, ""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet, and perhaps *we should be waiting for the United Nations*, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the *economy is a much bigger problem* as far as the president is concerned.""

So at the very least people can infer that he was cautious about the war and thought we should work with the UN longer. That and he apparently considered the economy a much bigger issue at the time.

Not a huge Trump fan but it's hard to not see this as reasonable. In 2003 a lot of Americans were still scared and freaked out by 9/11, and most people wanted SOMETHING to happen. Being angry and wanting retribution is natural, acting on it or jumping the gun is a whole different thing. Caution is important."

He counts the gross values of properties that he is involved with, not accounting for other investors or mortgages.  So, if a property was worth $100m and had a mortgage of $110m he would claim the $100m, not the negative $10m.

2.  He bragged about a winery that he owns outright that makes ""the best wine"".  Only problem is the winery says that they have no relationship to him.  The founder just had the same last name.

3.  He claims to have made money on deals where his investors lost everything.  Isn't that admitting to fraud?

4.  He once put out a statement that he was worth $750m at a time his net worth negative $20m.

Remember leaded petrol?  Invented by the Thomas Midgely, who later invented CFCs, despite the fact that the effects of lead on human health were well known. The worst of those effects were seen in the workers in their own factories. After some deaths in the factories, Midgely spilled some of the lead compound being used (TEL) on his hand in order to show how safe it was. He knew it wasn't safe, but the point was to convince journalists. He later took time off work due to lead poisoning... 

When Clare Cameron Patterson accidentally discovered the excess of lead in the environment while attempting to ascertain the age of the Earth, the companies who had invested in leaded petrol tried to ruin his life and reputation. 

Those who would try to poison the public would do well to look to the end of Midgely. Having invented two compounds that destroyed the environment (TEL and CFCs) his last invention was a set of pullies used to get him out of bed after his mobility had been reduced due to illness. 

His wife found him one morning, strangled by the threads of an invention by Thomas Midgely, like the rest of us. The lead he put in the environment is in your bones, and my bones. His successors haven't learned the lesson."

	1. Cloud storage which she was unaware of
	2. Unencrypted server
	3. Out of date security software
	4. Temporarily NO security software
2. Espionage (requires knowledge you're compromising security; also chargeable as Gross Negligence)
	1. The NSA told her it was unsecure
	2. Possibly gave classified information to Blumenthal, who had no clearance
	3. Discussed security issues with Blumenthal, and paid him, after the president explicitly forbid this
	4. Shared login credentials with many staffers, many of whom didn't have clearance
3. Obstruction of justice
	1. Deleted 30,000 emails without third-party inspection
	2. Attempted to delete the backups multiple times
	3. Claimed no backups existed
4. Perjury
	1. If any deleted emails were work related
	2. Claimed in 2012 that all emails on the server were erased, during the Benghazi hearings
5. Violation of the Federal Records Act
	1. If any deleted emails were work related
	2. Possibly even if they weren't
6. Violation of National Archive and Records Administration's regulations
	1. Improper storage of emails (including on their lawyer's flash drive)
	2. Making them less ""readily available to access""
7. Violation of Freedom of Information Act regulations
	1. Keeping the records private until two years after she left
	2. Claiming multiple times that the records no longer existed
	3. Her State Department only recording &lt;1% of emails sent from *anyone* in the department
8. Materially False Statements to federal agents
	1. Related to 7.3, in that she seemed to actively mislead Congress and the FBI by claiming ~90% of her emails were recorded by the State Department
	2. Pressuring a 3rd party to conspire in a cover-up\*
9. Conspiracy (under 18 U.S. Code § 371)
	1. She would almost certainly have known at least one of these was a crime

Failing that, they throw their subordinates to the wolves and let them take the blame. 

It would not surprise me at all to find that there are multiple influential people protecting Hillary, not out of friendship or loyalty, but because she has involved them as co-conspirators. "
"702","1461795567","I am sure that I will sacrifice some comment karma for this, but as a lawyer who has worked on numerous federal investigations (*opposing the government in a defense role*), has filed FOIA requests, and dealt with discovery in many cases, I think it is important to understand what is, and what is not, evidence of a scandal or cover up.

When responding to a FOIA requests, some poor lawyer who is probably only a few years removed from law school sits at a computer and reads a couple thousand emails per day and marks them to indicate whether or not they respond to that request. Those emails are then reviewed to determine whether they should be withheld because they contain privileged or confidential information, sensitive personal information, or in this case, I would imagine classified information. 

Yes. It is possible that this email was not produced because of an elaborate cover-up scheme. However, based on my experience, it seems far more likely that someone inadvertently failed to disclose it. When dealing with thousands or tens of thousands of documents and multiple FOIA requests, these things will certainly happen. We shouldn't go throwing around terms like ""scandal"" and ""cover-up"" as a result.

For the record, I think the fact that the emails were purged instead of saved, so that an independent or in camera review could take place if an issue arose is appalling and screams malfeasance (and this is coming from a Hillary supporter). But that has nothing to do with the absurd conclusions of this article.

These measures are widely regarded a not going far/fast enough to avert climate chaos. The longer we wait to act, the worse the situation becomes, and the more likely impacts will be ""pervasive and irreversible"" (IPCC 2014 Report). She won't support a ban on extraction on public lands or offshore drilling. She was behind the push to expand fracking and natural gas exports around the world. Fracking has now been linked to contamination of our shared, finite water supply and causing dangerous earthquakes. It releases methane, which is around 64x as powerful a GHG as CO2. But she continues to support it. These is the climate policies and the future ppl are voting for?! It's sickening. If you care about preserving a habitable planet for our kids and grandchildren, ppl, Hillary supporters, push back on these policies.

*The alternative of an affirmation began to be suggested, with one of the first laws explicitly allowing this appearing in England. Over time, the convention of offering both choices began to be quite common, and the language “swear (or affirm)” was written directly into the text of many oaths of office.*

http://atheism.about.com/od/ideasforatheistactivism/a/AffirmSwear.htm

*You have a right to just ""affirm"" that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. No gods, Bibles, or anything else religious need to be involved.*

The fraternity of it, the sheer volume of people and the suspicion that this is what a functioning civil society should look like.

I suspect this Bernie Sanders campaign might be a similar milestone for millions of young Americans.

"895","1461784587","&gt;The professional political class may not -- doesn't -- understand how this keeps happening. Trump to them is clownish and embarrassing, a transparent flim-flam artist without a speck of policy depth. But Republican voters see him differently -- as a straight-talking warrior against politics and political correctness at a time when people hate both. 


The media and political professional class still do not get it. They think this is just a republican issue. They completely miss the point that they themselves created Opinion/Identity voting. For example: ""Let's call Trump a racist and a bigot based on what he says and people won't vote for him. We will create shame associated with his vote"". The problem with that is this. Opinions, even when stated so fervently as to appear factual, are not issues. What we have learned as voters from the media is that even if we buy the opinion that Trump is a racist and a bigot, a vote for Hillary is a vote for 4 more years of the congress locking her out, more bad trade deals, more taxes on employers and individuals, more debt, more open borders, more Obama-care, more pro-abortion and anti gun judges on the Supreme court, more feckless foreign policy, and 4 more years of political correctness run a muck. Lastly, and worst of all 4 more years of the corporate buying of our government.

As a voter I no longer care about personal traits portrayed by the talking heads or what Trump says or what Hillary stands for. I care only what they say they are going to do or what they want to have happen. I am aware they likely will not be able to do all of it or maybe none of it but  whatever policies they put forward is what I am going to vote on. If Bernie says he wants free education I don't expect to know every nuance of how he is going to do it, that will be determined later, as well as if he can do it at all. But the fact that he is stating that he wants to do it is the issue I will consider. 

If Trump says he's going to build a wall that's his policy. Weather or not I think he's a bigot is irrelevant. If Hillary wants to not build a wall and ""build bridges"" that's the policy we are interested in. We no longer care about the idiotic talking heads who try to steer votes by calling people socialists, or woman hater, or racist or unqualified. If I vote for Trump I get his attempted agenda. If I vote for Bernie I get his. Same for Hillary, Cruz or Kasich. The people in the media have completely missed the fact that we used to listen to that crap and here we are with the candidates they themselves said we should be voting for and 70%+ of us think things are going in the wrong direction. The point is that for this election a lot of us are just not listening to them anymore.

Trump is winning because people just are not listening to pundits. Period. On either side. They are voting on policy positions stated by the candidates. Nothing more.

&gt; GOP frontrunner Donald Trump joined Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Wednesday, responding to Charles Koch’s recent statements about Trump.

&gt; “I don’t say anything to him,” Trump said responding to Koch. **“I’ve always liked the Kochs. They’re members of my club in Palm Beach.”**

&gt; **“What he says bears no relationship on what I do or say. I don’t need his money. I got my own money,”** Trump said, suggesting other politicians who take Koch’s donations are “puppets.”

&gt; “I disagree with them 100 percent on some of the things,” he added. “He actually went so far as to say he might back Hillary Clinton.”

&gt; “He made some statements that were not very good for the Republican Party and that’s too bad,” Trump said of Koch recently suggesting he might support Clinton instead of the GOP nominee.

&gt; “But, again, you have a lot of people that need him, and I don’t need him at all,” the billionaire said. **“One of the reasons he wouldn’t like me is because I don’t need him, and I won’t do what he tells me to do, because I couldn’t care less.”**

&gt; **“I’m going to do what’s right for the American people,” Trump said.  “And he can have his puppets, and they’re all over the place.”**"

I'm not sure on the rules on this: can Trump donate his personal wealth to a superpac that supports him?

If not, he won't get the full 'benefit' of Koch support... the Kochs can run attack ads that are way out of bounds of a 'clean campaign,' and the candidates they support can (rightfully) deny any wrongdoing.... because colluding with the superpac is illegal, they can't actually have any control over the superpac's ads.

If Trump can't donate to a superpac, then all dollars he puts into his campaign ads will have to end with ""I'm Donald Trump, and I approve this message.""

If Trump is allowed to donate to a superpac that supports his candidacy.... well then he actually doesn't need the Kochs at all.

Since superpac donations can be anonymous, I'm inclined to believe the latter is true... that he can self-fund his own superpac. Which is of course all kinds of fucked up, but I think technically legal?"

What these laws do is cloak homophobia with statutory legitimacy and add to the growing daily burden that LGBT individuals have to endure in society. They force us to consider our status as second class citizens when engaging in basic transactions for the necessities of life. Look at the laws in North Carolina or Missisippi: do I have to act straight when I am signing an apartment lease; what if the homeowner refuses to rent to my husband and I. What if I show up to the AIRBNB that I rented and get turned away; what if I get kicked out of a cab?

The state is providing permission to treat indivuduals differently on the basis of sexual orientation, and guess what, people do.

Furthermore, if the First Amendment actually shielded discrimination the way that some suggest that it does (it doesnt, there would be no need for this law - meaning that is simply an anti-gay symbolic gesture.

We have two private institutions that nominate candidates all the smaller parties lack the way to get the media to give them fair coverage and also to compete with the already established interests that are being funded by corporations. This actually allows a very very small window of views being represented and elected by a very small percentage of the population to control most of us.

That statement above is the best explanation I have as to why I get frustrated with my fellow Bernie Sander's supporters that say they will not vote for Hillary Clinton if she gets the nomination. I don't just support Bernie Sanders because of his honesty--I support him because of his progressive policies. Most election models predict that if a Republican wins the White House, the down-ballot effect will likely allow them to retain control of the Senate. Then a newly inaugurated Republican, with a Republican Senate, will get to nominate a justice to replace Justice Scalia--and likely Justice Kennedy, Ginsburg, and/or Breyer. There could easily be a 7-2 Conservative super-majority Supreme Court by 2020, which will likely remain until I'm 60 years old.

Considering there is almost no way for the Democrats to take back the House of Representatives before 2032, the Supreme Court is almost the only way for progressive policies to be advanced in the upcoming decade. A Republican Congress with a Republican President could easily pass legislation that eviscerates environmental protections, destroys Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security (through privatization), and causes millions to lose health coverage when the Affordable Care Act is repealed. A flat-tax, which is incredibly harmful to the poor and beneficial to the rich, would likely be passed, along with other pro-business and pro-wealthy tax legislation (eliminating taxes capital gains and dividends for example), which would exacerbate income and wealth inequality. Affirmative action would be wiped out, and legislation targeting the LGBTQ community and reversing hard-fought rights would be implemented. Legislation making it harder or impossible for huge groups of people to vote would be passed. Union-busting legislation would become law nationwide. The minimum wage would be curtailed or abolished and labor protections would begin to disappear. And to top it off, other pro-business (like taking away your right to a trial through mandatory arbitration) and anti-campaign finance reform decisions would be upheld and bolstered by a conservative Supreme Court.

Some of my liberal/progressive friends say they will vote for Trump or a 3rd Party over Clinton because they believe the backlash a Cruz or Trump will create will help lead to a truly progressive candidate in 4 years. But the reality is that even if in 4 years a Democrat takes back the White House, Republicans will still control the House of Representatives and all of the damaging legislation they have passed won’t be able to be reversed. And even IF an unlikely political revolution happens and Democrats win seats in the Senate they haven’t won in a generation and take back the Senate, and magically take the House of Representatives and White House in 2020, any major legislation they pass will get shot down in the Supreme Court by a minimum 5-4 conservative majority, if not a 6-3 or 7-2 super majority. This election isn’t about breaking up the banks, getting affordable college, or legislation to address income inequality in the next 4 years—this election is about creating the possibility of those things in the coming decades. This election is about moving forward where possible, but mostly about not falling back decades. A Clinton victory could give progressives/liberals some time to build a movement, to develop a political infrastructure to protect what needs protecting, and to change the direction of the country--or as Sander's calls it, a ""political revolution."" A Republican President, with a Republican Congress, and a conservative Supreme Court will destroy any progress liberals have made the last few decades and will reverse any momentum the political revolution happens to make in the future decades to come. There is no political revolution without a liberal Supreme Court--and since Hillary Clinton's more conservative husband gave us the Court's most liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Hillary is getting my vote if she is the nominee--without hesitation.

Maybe that's why Bernie did not win in the Democratic primaries, not a conspiracy.  Clinton has probably already figured out that by continuing to push further left to appease Sanders, she risks alienating some of the more moderate, centrist voters. And if her foe is Trump, some left of center moderates may consider him an alternative to the far left platform Sanders is pushing.  Other than immigration, Trump has been a little squishy on hard and fast policy and he has no voting history to use for vetting, so he can hem and haw in the general election.  At some point, the loss of these moderates will more than offset any gains from the far left.  In fact, if you notice, the GOP tends to be far right in the primaries and shift more moderate (but still right wing) in the general election so they can try to woo the moderates. At some point, a decision will be made to let the squeaky wheel of Bernie squeak, we have better uses for out limited supply of grease. This decision will just come sooner the more people take a Bernie of Bust stand.  Why try to accommodate a group that states under no conditions will they support you.  The Bernie or Bust crowd has shot themselves in the foot with the repeated refrains of never Hillary.  Pushing for a party platform the party thinks will harm them more than help them will not work.  Eventually, the party will make a judgement on where their best voter outreach needs to go.  Moderate Republicans who show signs or even state they may cross over to Clinton, or Bernie or Bust people who say they will never under any circumstances, I'd die first before I'd vote for Hillary.
