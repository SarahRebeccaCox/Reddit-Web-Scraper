So here's **THINGS I WANT TO HEAR:**

* Bernie getting grilled on guns: Gun control is a major issue in this country no matter what your stance. Hillary oddly enough has a bit of a more left leaning stance than Bernie on guns. The man come from a rural-ish state where gun ownership is totally a normal thing. He needs to continue to articulate his position on guns and contrast it to Clinton.

* Hillary gets grilled on her donors. You can't just take money from people and have them expect nothing from you in return.

* Bernie's foreign policy. A coalition of middle-eastern states is a bit too wishy-washy. A bit more substance if you please. 

* Hillary's approval ratings among the youth vote. Even if they vote less, the youth vote of today are the 45+ year old voters of tomorrow. Let's face it.... a lot of people straight up don't trust her and furthermore don't like her. How is she going to turn this around if she wants that voting block?  

Above all else though, I want more open time in the debate for the candidates to spar with each other rather than just answer questions. "

Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas.

"135","1460638107","I keep hoping Bernie would say this at a debate and he never does. He keeps letting Hilary get away with saying ""i can take their money and stay pure!""

The problem is Bernie doesn't want to fully hang the albatross around Hillary's neck, perhaps in deference to the fact that she is likely to be the nominee and will need progressives' support in the general. 

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

Everyone in the establishment is warning that Bernie had better be careful and not do anything to permanently damage Hillary. But you KNOW if Bernie were leading Hillary would do everything she could to permanently damage Bernie without hesitation, because all she cares about is winning, despite her claims to the contrary.

And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.  

Both conventions this year will be hotly contested.  We'll see delegates switching, terrible accusations being made, etc. But what we'll mainly see is a question of ""Who is the Party?  Is it the people who register and vote for that Party?  Or is it the few wealthy elites behind the scenes that are the Party?""

This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town.

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

His blogs have fallen from wonky yet snarky into pure spin. They're short on specifics. He hand-waves away every criticism of Hillary while highlighting any shortcomings of Bernie, often without going into specifics, which is really quite damning when you consider how precise his criticisms of say, Paul Ryan were.

Glass-Steagal wouldn't completely fix everything? No shit. But it would do so, so much. And that's the sum total of his critique on Bernie. 

Edit: oh shit, I hadn't even read ""Bernie on the Brink"". FUCK Paul Krugman. What a fucking preposterous liar, and I don't even get me started on him parroting the Bernie Bro trash. What a fucking naked sellout."
"279","1460651938","Krugman is correct, though. See the FCIC testimonies of [Gary Gorton](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15787) and [Ben Bernanke](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm) as a starting point. Then read up on any serious research done by [central banks](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr506.pdf), government agencies (like [the OFR](https://financialresearch.gov/briefs/files/OFRbr-2015-03-repo-sec-lending.pdf)) and finance academics.

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

Many Verizon employees are being placed on emergency work assignment to fill the position of these union members.

It is not just the union workers that are being mistreated by this corporation, but the other employees that work hard day-to-day without going on strike to ask for increased wages/benefits.

* For further reference that is about 1.5x the voter turnout for Dems in Massachusetts in both 2008 and this year and only slightly more than Rep. voter turnout in Mass this year
* Massachusetts has ~1/3 of New York's population, but has open primaries. This shows either the huge opportunity for either candidate to drive voter turnout on Tuesday, or just how much closed primaries affect turnout, or both.

I did an analysis of what the delegates totals would be if the South voted today, and if Bernie lost the black vote by 40 points (30-70) Clinton's lead would be about ~115 less, or around 100.  This is assuming he still does a little worse than he has in statess like Missouri, but I think the 30% is a reasonable mark.

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning."

"531","1460623418","These articles do so much damage to the very real issue of racism and inequality in the US.  I wish the author of this story was read the fable ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" as a young child.  He would then understand the dangers of yelling about a serious issue when there is no serious issue in sight.

A couple qualifiers before I continue, since it's now fun to call people racist. I have had a black homeless man stay overnight with me in my house. I worked in a predominantly black inner city school.  When a black kid stole my phone from me, and the police brought him to me and encouraged me to press charges against him, I told the kid I wouldn't because I don't believe that the criminal justice system is effective in changing behaviors from negative to positive.  When he missed his bus after school because of being handcuffed and brought to me, I gave him a ride home.  My father-in-law is black.  The list goes on and on, but it's ultimately a shame I have to list off these type of things to MAYBE get the pass from well to do east village (usually white, not sure about this case) bloggers that I'm not racist.

This article is not talking about a race problem.  Here's proof:

1.) Take yourself, and your expired, white boy ID to a college campus bar, and try to get in with an expired ID.  40% of the time, an expired ID won't get you into a bar.  A larger percentage of times, you won't be able to buy liquor at a liquor store. Why? Because people look alike.  Expired IDs can be given to those people.  It is not a valid ID, no matter the color of your skin.  I have been denied entry into places for this reason.  If I get pulled over with an expired ID, I get a ticket.  

2.) The BMV is a pain in the ass, plain and simple.  I had to switch from an Indiana to Ohio drivers license.  Went in with a valid passport, a valid drivers license, a marriage certificate, a print out of my tax return (I e-file, so there is no ""official"" copy).  The result?  Denied, because nothing was an official document with my social security number on it.  Photocopies aren't acceptable.  I fought and reasoned, saying that a passport is more or less the gold standard for identification...but the rules are the rules, and there is no exception. The woman promised me, that even if her sister came in with the same documents as me, she couldn't give her a license, lest she lose her job.  

3.) When the day is done, the name on the most official document this man had does not match his name.  If the white wife of newly wed couple moved to Wisconsin, and had not had time to fully complete her name change process, she would have the same issues.

Look, I tend to think that voter ID laws are designed to prevent the poorest of poor from voting.  I also know that if you are among the poorest of poor, your chances of being black are much greater than your chances of being white.  I can connect the dots.  But this article headline makes it sound like the KKK was standing behind the counter of the BMV and denied him because he was black.  Articles like these are exactly why an asshole fascist like Trump has gained traction...and why his supporters don't think racism exists.  Fox News and Glen Beck will rip this article apart, and say ""see!  Because this article was wrongly saying the issue was because of race, accusations racism are universally farcical.""  And the far right keeps building momentum off the backs of non-journalistic clickbait like this."

I feel like the whole concept of a career is completely changing and my generation won't ever see the kind of working environment that generations before us have. Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily. And it makes more sense to me that the 'benefits' be paid for with our taxes rather than out of pocket. Obviously the cost of it is daunting, but I think it will only makes sense moving forward.

"650","1460647105","As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

"659","1460584798","So Half True? "
"660","1460615853","Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"

"756","1460592937","I was one of Dana Frank's graduate students.

"757","1460588235","The scarier thing about all of this (I mean, really who gives a fuck if yet another latin american banana republic has a forced change of leadership?) is hillary's fluency in revisionist policy.

2 - she was oblivious and just willing to violate US law"

"762","1460625392","So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp; (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

"765","1460608054","[Verizon addressed this already.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/feeling-bern-reality-facts-verizon-moral-economy-lowell-mcadam)


&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

&gt; Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, “so messed up”.

Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.
