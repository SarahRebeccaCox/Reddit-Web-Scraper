"122","1460644130","Anecdotally, a few friends and a greater number of friends of friends discovered this happened to them in Louisiana's primary. All were Democrats until they weren't. All planned to vote for Sanders. It shouldn't matter much as Hillary won by a blowout in this state, but it still happened. 

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana. If I called breathlessly to a local election official with how several people I know plus dozens upon dozens of people on Internet were disenfranchised, it would all be shrugged off. Even Mark Crispin Miller's reports about the elections of 2000 and 2004 never gained much traction. He and others like him get pigeonholed as tin foil hat conspiracists. 

I can only imagine the nonsense other people have to endure. "
"123","1460648696","I just went online to check my voter status in CA and they have no record. I have printed out copy of my voter registration with Affidavit number. When I called, I am directed to a VM where I have to leave a message of what the problem is. I called the Secretary of State's office and they won't help. They say I have to go through my county. I have been a registered Republican since 1979. This year, I switched to independent, which allows me to vote in the Democratic Primary. Now, there is no record. "
"124","1460648848","Happened to my grandmother &amp; (me?)

Yesterday she found out that she was not registered and has ""never been registered"" to vote, though she's actually worked for the census numerous years and **always** votes.

She found out because after we moved counties, we both registered online in our new county (Riverside) for mail in ballots and didnt receive our mail-in ballots during the vote a couple months ago, thus we didn't vote. so she phoned to find out what happened...

I was about 2 seconds away from making a thread about this yesterday titled ""Voter Supression in California""

for the record we're both Republicans"
"125","1460653851","Statisticians have been warning of ""impossible"" numbers coming from elections for over 15 years now.  They have gotten almost no attention. Arizona, Kansas and the latest Kentucky governor's race to mention a few.

And these are established Phd. level, teach at universities or work for NSA statisticians; not conspiracy theorist.  People trained to find odd patterns in data.

These need to be fully investigated."

"128","1460648187","I've been checking and screenshotting my voter registration status every day or two (with a date and time shown in the screenshot) since the registration deadline in my state.

Given this apparent epidemic of registration fuckery, everyone should be doing the same both before the primary in case your party gets changed, and again before the general in case you get wrongly purged from the voter rolls."
"129","1460639605","but voter ID would fix this, right? "
"130","1460657018","Ok here's the thing. I believe this happened to me as well n the AZ primary. I'm not sure how to get the hard copy of the change but I may look into it. Anyways in order for this to be a conspiracy the change would have to benefit someone. I just don't see how anyone could benefit with certainty. Sure you could say Hillary benefited from me not being able to vote. But no one would have any idea if I was going to vote for Hillary of Bernie. It would be a crap shoot as to which vote got nullified. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have to error more on the side that this more of a database type problem. I saw tons of people in line with me that experienced that same issue. Seeing forged names looks suspicious but how could you possibly determine who could benefit from an affiliation change. Hell I'm not even in the under 40 group."

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves.

Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues."

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

&gt;Devine told The Daily Beast in a phone conversation that “we had to go back at them [the Clinton campaign],” and New York is the place. “The political culture of America is very different,” he said.

But if you go to New York and you have someone who is tough and aggressive and someone who’s not going to engage, the tough and aggressive candidate wins.

&gt;“We’re determined not to be the victim,” he said.

&gt;Clinton’s refusal to say Sanders is “qualified” set the stage for the cage match along with festering grievances about Clinton portraying Sanders as a tool of the gun lobby, aggravated by what Devine calls her “specious” case about Vermont guns feeding violence in NY. (The Washington Post gave it three Pinocchios.) Sanders is hitting fracking hard upstate, calling for a federal ban, and tying it along with the Wall Street money Clinton has received to the theme, “You can’t make the right political decisions unless you are free of the influence of special interests,” Devine said.

This is assuming he still does a little worse than he has in statess like Missouri, but I think the 30% is a reasonable mark.

They should all be primaries. They should all be open, but Republicans and Democrats would go at the same time so that would be less of an issue. And no delegates, super or otherwise.

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do.

They MUST decrypt the data if the government so requires. Obviously, it is not possible if the encryption occurs **client side** and the key is in the hands of the user.

* terrorists and criminals will always have their own encryption, like PGP.   Or use foreign services.  This will affect only ordinary citizens.

The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.

"739","1460623418","These articles do so much damage to the very real issue of racism and inequality in the US.  I wish the author of this story was read the fable ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" as a young child.  He would then understand the dangers of yelling about a serious issue when there is no serious issue in sight.

A couple qualifiers before I continue, since it's now fun to call people racist. I have had a black homeless man stay overnight with me in my house. I worked in a predominantly black inner city school.  When a black kid stole my phone from me, and the police brought him to me and encouraged me to press charges against him, I told the kid I wouldn't because I don't believe that the criminal justice system is effective in changing behaviors from negative to positive.  When he missed his bus after school because of being handcuffed and brought to me, I gave him a ride home.  My father-in-law is black.  The list goes on and on, but it's ultimately a shame I have to list off these type of things to MAYBE get the pass from well to do east village (usually white, not sure about this case) bloggers that I'm not racist.

This article is not talking about a race problem.  Here's proof:

1.) Take yourself, and your expired, white boy ID to a college campus bar, and try to get in with an expired ID.  40% of the time, an expired ID won't get you into a bar.  A larger percentage of times, you won't be able to buy liquor at a liquor store. Why? Because people look alike.  Expired IDs can be given to those people.  It is not a valid ID, no matter the color of your skin.  I have been denied entry into places for this reason.  If I get pulled over with an expired ID, I get a ticket.  

2.) The BMV is a pain in the ass, plain and simple.  I had to switch from an Indiana to Ohio drivers license.  Went in with a valid passport, a valid drivers license, a marriage certificate, a print out of my tax return (I e-file, so there is no ""official"" copy).  The result?  Denied, because nothing was an official document with my social security number on it.  Photocopies aren't acceptable.  I fought and reasoned, saying that a passport is more or less the gold standard for identification...but the rules are the rules, and there is no exception. The woman promised me, that even if her sister came in with the same documents as me, she couldn't give her a license, lest she lose her job.  

3.) When the day is done, the name on the most official document this man had does not match his name.  If the white wife of newly wed couple moved to Wisconsin, and had not had time to fully complete her name change process, she would have the same issues.

Look, I tend to think that voter ID laws are designed to prevent the poorest of poor from voting.  I also know that if you are among the poorest of poor, your chances of being black are much greater than your chances of being white.  I can connect the dots.  But this article headline makes it sound like the KKK was standing behind the counter of the BMV and denied him because he was black.  Articles like these are exactly why an asshole fascist like Trump has gained traction...and why his supporters don't think racism exists.  Fox News and Glen Beck will rip this article apart, and say ""see!  Because this article was wrongly saying the issue was because of race, accusations racism are universally farcical.""  And the far right keeps building momentum off the backs of non-journalistic clickbait like this."

California did this in the 70s and it led to the so-called ""tax revolt era"" where citizens overwhelmingly voted in favor of restrictions on the ability of the state to raise tax revenue from property and business taxes. Result: CA nearly went bankrupt in the 80s and 90s because they couldn't raise taxes to generate new revenue.

"767","1460647105","As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it.

Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily.

"876","1460584798","So Half True? "
"877","1460615853","Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

Hillary Clinton reads a script that includes her direct involvement in the ""CP time"" joke, and decides that is a good idea. After being called out on it she does not apologize, and also shifts the blame to de Blasio.

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job.

Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"

"1000","1460625392","So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp; (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

&gt; Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, “so messed up”.

Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

In my opinion this is a fantastic idea, and the best shot it's had at passing in a very long time. There are a few monkey wrenches people will point out:

1. What about people whose employers send out W-2s (or other documents) late or with incorrect information? Employers won't like the potential for liability on their part.

"1407","1460607809","Okay. It is good as the whole build-up to it is ""Save the children!"". But here's why it is not good in the long run. It costs $10,000 just to apply to be a grower. Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

&gt;Mrs. Clinton focused on specific policy items, including expanding low-income housing tax credits, matching $10,000 in savings for a down payment for blacks who lag behind whites in home ownership, and a new plan “to fight environmental justice across America.”

Im confused by this. Is she saying poor people will get an additional 10k to match say 10k for a down payment on a house? Also drives me nuts that she constantly blames Republicans about the recession but nobody calls her out on her husbands work to start the deregulating process. Also Bush had the same kind of idea helping Americans who couldn't afford homes buy homes and it led to the recession. It sounds like a dangerous plan."

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.

The banks have had years to work on this, and I don't know of a single one that's taking it seriously. The plans I'd seen read like boiler plate legalese with a few financial details thrown in. You can read the whole thing and wonder ""that was a plan??""

And regulators have agreed. It's such a simple and common sense regulation, and if they took it seriously the banks could argue that they're not too big to fail. But coming up with emergency plans doesn't make any profit, and doesn't earn anyone a big bonus, so they don't take it seriously."

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!"

A large percentage of the new people he's picked up, however, seem to be of the ""Bern or Bust"" model; it seems foolhardy to count on much of a long-term revival from his candidacy.

""Partly""? This allegation needs to be a lot more specific to be taken at all seriously. Who exactly is he claiming promised something and who did they promise it to? Does ""partly"" mean the linkage between the trade deal and the military bidding process was inferred? As he also mentions a ""compromise version of the trade deal"" being discussed was this a USTR rep running some potential trade deal changes by someone from the company who was serving on one of the advisory committees?

&gt; That $1.8 billion in relief from Goldman that's supposed to help homeowners in distress? Miller says that in these cases, the terms are kept vague, and Goldman can use that money to do things that are in its best interest anyway, like writing off debt that's obviously not going to be repaid, demolish foreclosed upon houses, and modify mortgages that are in distress.

&gt;""It would be like me agreeing to be right handed all day today or to wake up tomorrow morning and have coffee,"" Miller says of the settlement agreements. ""Those things are going to happen anyway.""

&gt;He also pointed to something critics have called the ""bullshit-to-cash ratio"" as one indicator of how little the penalty will affect a giant like Goldman. Basically, it's important to note that only about $3 billion of the $5 billion will be paid out in cash. On the other hand, about half is tax-deductible and will be placed on the backs of taxpayers––even though the median American family lost about 40 percent of their wealth during the worst stretch of the crisis.

&gt;What's more, the New York Times notes that after incentives and tax credits, Goldman can chop about a billion dollars off the total penalty. According to a chart attached to the settlement, for every dollar Goldman puts into community investment in New York, they get a $2 tax credit."

"2294","1460558485","Banking Execs: #Too Big Too Jail"
"2295","1460564042","One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

The reason why his 7 state win streak hasn't accounted to a huge change in the race is most of those states are smaller states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming) And the system is rarely a winner take all, and winning by a huge margin in a state worth 20 to 30 delegates isn't worth as much by winning a state worth 300 by the same margin or even a much closer one.  For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.  "
"2424","1460510197","I have been stalking this election as an outside observer to the US and it really is fascinating to me. I am utterly bemused by the lack of critical analysis of a range of sources and the ability for everyday Americans to draw their own informed and fully justified conclusion.


I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders.

That does not seem unfair.  Why should Wyoming outweigh Florida?

This is the only evidence they give that the Democratic primaries are rigged.

The main evidence I have seen boils down to this:  ""Bernie is the candidate of the people.  If it were not rigged, he would be winning.""

"2766","1460502835","The thing is, she has already delayed this for so long that when, inevitably, a transcript is leaked to the press, nobody will believe it's real. Especially if it doesn't kiss Wall Street's ass.

Nobody makes three million bucks for a dozen speeches and gives the people paying for them a hard time."
"2767","1460503352","Gawd, the fact that we're even asking ourselves if there's a chance ""that her campaign pledge to “rein in Wall Street” cannot be taken seriously."" and she's still the front-runner boggles whats left of my mind, like we've now just officially accepted that we should take any bullshit that spouted and just hope for the best. I'm as cynical as the next guy, but dammit, don't we have higher standards than this? If we can't believe what our supposed representatives are saying then what is there even any support there at all?"
"2768","1460521784","I fully believe her pledge but without the transcripts i dont know if she said ""rain in wall street"" or ""reign in wall street"" cause it sure as shit wasnt rein"
"2769","1460517381","&gt; the suspicion will remain that she has cast a blind eye on Goldman’s dark years and that her campaign pledge to “rein in Wall Street” cannot be taken seriously.

I'm pretty sure she's taking the ""stay silent and be thought to be evil, than to open her mouth and remove all doubt"" approach."
"2770","1460551648","The editorial lays it all out very well.  Her relationship with Goldman calls into question her integrity and judgment.  Specifically, you cannot simultaneously represent yourself as a champion of progressive values and at the same time get in bed with the likes of Goldman."
"2771","1460551774","""doubt"" ?

You'd have to be an idiot to think twice about it.  There's every indication that she's in bed with them, and nothing except her word that she's not.  ..And there's every indication not to trust a damned thing she says, too. "
"2772","1460509651"," Two (three?) ex-employees of Goldman-Sachs are on her campaign staff and her daughter is married to an ex-Goldman-Sachs employee. She owns shell companies and benefits from the Clinton Foundation.

"
"2773","1460520987","Apparently suspicion is prefered to confirmation that it's true, if those speeches had nothing of interest she'd of released them immediately, with a smile even. "
"2774","1460546636","We don't even need the transcripts to know this. She has taken personal and campaign money from the banking industry. What else do we need to know she is in their pocket and her ""reign them in"" claim is complete and utter b.s. So many are ignorant of this or willfully disregarding this in order to be apart of history by voting for the first female president. I'm convinced the only reason many are voting for Hillary and ignoring all the obvious reasons why she shouldn't even be a possibility, is because she is a woman. That right there folks is sexism, disregarding hard facts of her corruption, her two faced and inconsistent policies over the years in order to make history by electing a woman into the Oval. It's hypocrisy at it's finest and it's disgusting."
"2775","1460521576","And the fact that they feel that suspicion is better than exposing what she actually said tells you all you need to know about what she actually said."

"2777","1460548837","Nothing will remove the suspicions a lifetime of action have fostered."
"2778","1460553001","I think I can put this great mystery to rest right now.  Clinton, in large part because she was on the speaking circuit and being paid large sums of money to address Goldman Sachs, declined to accuse her paying hosts of perverse  economic vampirism and may have in fact even complimented Goldman's role in the global economic system.  She is declining to release those remarks now to avoid being kneecapped by the left wing of the Democratic party before she gets to the general, where she will have a lot more ideological room to discuss this more freely. Expect those transcripts to come out after she nails down the nomination.  "
"2779","1460556883","Not releasing those speeches just adds to the suspicion that something bad is in them...and while Sanders is pretty calm about the issue, her GOP counterpart won't if she wins.

And then what? She hasn't released them for so long, if she releases them now it's almost guaranteed to bring something bad to light. If she doesn't release them at all, people will always (and probably rightfully so) think she's untrustworthy. 

She's such a corporate sock puppet and establishment politician...and a total liability during a general election. Too many skeletons in her closet. "
"2780","1460557010","I think it would be an unwise move."
"2781","1460557341","She's Pinocchio with the strings still attached. She wants us to believe she's a real boy, but she thinks that worshipping Wall Street is wishing upon a star, but it's really just turning all the little boys into donkeys."
"2782","1460559327","It's to the point where the cover up is worse than the crime.

If she was to release those transcripts, who's the say they won't be edited?"
"2783","1460563327","Her speech was about women entrepreneurs.  Regarding the content, there seems like a lot of speculation without any fact.  It feels like a conspiracy theory.  It's Republicans who generally support the interests of big money.  And in 2012 about 80% of donations from Wall Street were to Republicans.  I don't think people who want to protect their big money would gain much voting for a Democrat.  "
"2784","1460501577","I think it would be fucking hilarious if she released the speeches and it showed her giving them tons of shit and taking the piss out of them"
"2785","1460525796","Honestly is there any Hillary supporters here that could explain to me if there's a genuine belief that she will go after Wall Street?Or does any of this matter to her support base?"
"2786","1460518424","Blind eye?

The lady put on a bag full of eye patches, blinders, injected the koolaid, placed triple burlap sacks over her head and with her hand out for the money she sumersaulted landing with her head up her ass.

She can't see a thing."
"2787","1460530129","I really don't get why people can still vote for her when things like this are clearly an indication that she can't be trusted.

I'm really curious, I don't want to attack her character, I just want to know how people can still brush off something like this and vote for her? Don't they know that this is happening? Are they just poorly informed?"
"2788","1460514620","Are Goldman's Dark years over?

Did I miss something?"
"2789","1460522896","The bit I don't get about the ""held to the same standards"" piece is why she hasn't taken the stance of insisting on being held to the highest of standards. If you intend to take the highest office in the country and believe you have the qualifications and are fit for the job, you should say no standard is high enough. But that is not how to be successful in modern American politics, so I guess the point is moot."
"2790","1460525024","But we already know what she said. She *basically* told them to cut it out!"
"2791","1460535258","Aaaaaand America will vote for her anyway. "
"2792","1460555623","They are almost certainly boring, motivational speeches. I don't know what Reddit thinks is in there. The reason she isn't releasing them is that even if there is nothing, people will find something to take out of context and hammer her about. Right now, the only people who care about the speech transcripts are people already in the tank for Berning Man. There is zero political capital to gain from releasing them. "
"2793","1460501157","[deleted]"
"2794","1460525654","Yeah, yeah, fucking yeah.  The people voting for her don't give a flying fuck about this, and it's all just opinion pieces based on nothing anyway.  Hillunatics never let a silly thing like hard facts get in their way, and authors making statements like, ""Hillary can't be taken seriously when she says x because of y"", they're making really, really fuckheaded assumptions.

None of that shit matters.  Hillary is an establishment candidate, and the establishment wants her in place.  Her continued successes seem to cut through this unending stream of editorials like butter.

She's a liar, a dirty dealer, a flip-flopper, probably a criminal, and one of the least progressive ""progressives"" that have ever existed, but she's still doing pretty fucking well in the polls."
"2795","1460545949","I'm stupefied that anyone would take anything she says seriously. 

"
"2796","1460524343","Let's be honest, if she release the transcripts they will be completely made up. "
"2797","1460501069","The Sanders crowd has been beating this smear to death since before Super Tuesday.  It's been a flop.  Time to move on.  Maybe actually talking about the issues would be a refreshing change."
"2798","1460527303","this article is making a great point.  I hope Bernie nails her on this issue during the debate.  

I cant blame her though... 

well she needs a ton of money to send in a ton of fake absentee ballots into NY... that way when she suppresses the vote it hurts bernie more than it hurts her.  You know.... business as usual"
"2799","1460529762","Where is the proof that there were speeches!?  You don't give a speech when you are bribed you just say thank you."
"2800","1460541624","Serious question because I haven't been following this too closely, as there didn't seem to be much to follow: presuming she said something nefarious, why not just release a completely fake transcript? Presumably the people who heard the speech don't have a copy, and it also, I assume, wouldn't benefit them to damage her if she were in their pocket. My only thought is that she knows someone has a copy, and that someone is waiting to use it in the general to usher in a Republican. "
"2801","1460553109","I think the funniest thing about the increasingly desperate Sanders camp is that no matter how badly they are going to lose, they can find these 3rd rate blogs, and also-ran ""news"" articles that keep the echo chamber ringing.

That takes a special kind of dedication.
"
"2802","1460553144","How could any voter/supporter take that claim seriously?"
"2803","1460553412","when Bernie releases his tax returns I'll care"
"2804","1460555603","The transcripts are at least an interesting debate. I'm sick of hearing know-nothings complain about the speech fees as if they were de facto bribes. "
"2805","1460563907","This will go nicely with the other five front page articles about the exact same thing."
"2806","1460499281","Let's be honest...

If Jane Sanders had said what Bill said last week, or if it was Bernie who participated in the 'CP time' skit, his campaign would basically be over.

Speaking of Bill last week... 

How is it that BLM protesters can protest at a Medicare event in Seattle, Bernie steps aside and hands the protesters the mic, but both Bernie and ""Bernie supporters"" (again, it wasn't even a Bernie rally, it was a Medicare event for seniors) end up having a ""Black problem"" as a result, with pundits going up and down about what happened at that event 24/7, and it launches into a narrative about Bernie's ""Black problem"" for months, while Hillary can condescend to a BLM protester, have her actually *thrown out* (at a event the girl paid $500 to enter), have her supporters at the event actually ***hiss*** at her, and then Hillary says ""Back to the issues, the issues that are important"" after she's thrown out (as if what that girl was there protesting wasn't an ""important issue"") but the media and pundits end up paying this little mind and it becomes a complete non-issue after a couple days?

In fact, has anyone else noticed how ""liberals"" have suddenly turned on BLM after they started going after the Clintons?"
"2807","1460525065","Why is her go to always when everybody else does it? Are we electing a leader or a follower? It would accurately describe her political career. Only makes decisions when around consensus and polls rather than morals and ethics. #PleaseLead"
"2808","1460497291","Who else would be able to be taken seriously while under FBI investigation?  Change stances with the wind and be considered a strong leader?  Attempt to hide from FOI and refuse releasing transcripts and claim to be the most transparent candidate?

She's a joke, and that people still support her is a very unfunny punchline."
"2809","1460508679","Pretty much any other person in her position would be in way deeper shit. It's mind boggling that a person under investigation by the FBI is running for president, even more mind boggling that she's actually doing well while being investigated."

Michelle Naef, administrator of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence, a Memphis, Tenn.-based organization founded in 1991 by a Gandhi grandson, said these remarks “could be incredibly harmful.”

The evidence show that she is at least negligent, Pres. Obama even admitted it. The future of the Democratic Party literally depends on whether if the FBI decides it is just negligent or grossly negligent. That thin line is all that separates the Democratic Party from a complete political disaster.

She's absolutely held to a double standard, if you're under investigation by the FBI of course it's going to come up in debates. 
They're not attacking her because"" she's a woman"" She's only a target because of the choices she's made during her political career. She's not the first and certainly not the last.

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me. I remember how embarrassed I was when I got turned down from a job after being interviewed and hired and then my background check came back and they said my credit was worrisome so they didn't hire me, saying they would be happy to talk to me again when I resolved it all.

"2988","1460556375","&gt;So why hasn't return-free filing happened yet? The short answer is lobbying, and in particular lobbying by companies like Intuit. In 2013, ProPublica's Liz Day wrote an incredible exposé on just how hard Intuit has lobbied to stop return-free filing from becoming a reality:

&gt;&gt;[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

&gt;&gt;Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

This is the problem.  [Campaign finance is the meta issue; it encompasses all others because every legislative battle today, comes down to money.](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/hillary-clintons-plan-to-reform-campaign-finance-i.html)"
"2989","1460553305","&gt;The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it's been doing for years.

&gt;Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.

&gt;Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new ""return-free"" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like. Warren isn't the first person to propose this. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) both have similar bills this Congress.

"2990","1460554512","This proposal makes far too much sense to ever make it through.

The US tax situation is messed up. I've now filed Dutch, French and US tax returns and the US one is by far the most effort.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

Make filing an amendment in this case cost a little money to discourage procrastination in those who do have changes to make.

&gt;CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process:
“Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturday’s 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.”

- total # of contributors
- total # of contributors whose total donations per quarter are below $200
- average per-quarter donation
- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

1) Bernie isn't that great of a campaigner, compared with Obama. He has more money on hand but can't translate that into votes. Maybe his campaign isn't run as well or isn't as astute as Obama's '08 campaign.

2) Money's influence in politics isn't absolute. Maybe money helps a campaign but can't fix all of a candidate's hurdles.

"3338","1460558032","Goldman admitted to fraud, which largely contributed to the destruction of our economy.

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

&gt;Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

&gt;Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

&gt;Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

&gt;Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

&gt;Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.

In the NRA version no one gets hurt and the wolf is just restrained.

In the original Hansel and Gretle the parents are even worse and plan on abandoning the children in the woods. The children end up being tricked into captivity and uses as slaves before being prepared to be cannibalistically eaten. However they trick the witch and burn her alive in her own oven.

&gt;Bertha Oliva compared the current situation to the early 1980s, when the CIA funded, armed, and trained Honduran government death squads that murdered hundreds of opposition activists.

and:
&gt;“When we first began in 1982, we faced death squads,” said Oliva, also speaking through a translator. “Now, it’s like going back to the past. We know there are death squads in Honduras.”

also:
&gt;The coup was accompanied by a huge rise in political violence. By 2012, state security forces had assassinated more than 300 people, and 34 members of the opposition and 13 journalists had disappeared, according to data compiled by Honduran human rights organizations. The political assassinations added to the emboldened violence from gangs and drug traffickers, making Honduras one of the most dangerous countries in the world. In 2012, Reuters reported that it had the highest murder rate of any country.

&gt;Although the murder rate has since declined, political violence in Honduras has continued. Since the end of 2012, at least 22 prominent environmental activists have been killed, according to Global Witness.

"3597","1460640210","&gt;But I was struck, in our conversation, by the frequency with which Carter framed today's world within those same dynamics that had preoccupied his early career: great power rivalries, nuclear weapons, and the power of deterrence to keep the world in line.

&gt;It's not that he's unconcerned with terrorism or rogue states, both of which he discussed at length. But he clearly drew from his experiences in the 1980s and '90s an acute sensitivity to the world-shaking stakes of great power rivalries, and a firm belief in the role that deterrence and nuclear weapons still play.

&gt;Carter described a world where not just American power but also global peace and stability will be increasingly challenged by other powers. He returned over and over to the same answer to this problem: the power of deterrence, backed up by overwhelming American superiority and, ultimately, by nuclear weapons.

&gt;But deterrence works on decades-old understandings of warfare that are, today, rapidly changing. As countries develop new tools and techniques of war, Carter warned that deterrence, the foundation on which American power and global stability are built, needs to change as well.

&gt;That is not a challenge that grabs as many headlines as terrorism or rogue states. But the stakes — the international order as know it, 70 years of peace between the major powers, and the thousands of nuclear warheads backing it up — could not be higher.

Therefore, whatever the cost of wind is, it is almost entirely in addition to the cost of fossil fuel power generation.

"3682","1460473907","There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

http://www.newsday.com/opinion/hillary-clinton-at-newsday-long-island-transcript-1.11680010

Newsday's website is subscription only, but I will post as much as I think I safely can under the doctrine of fair use:

&gt;Filler: So, New York and Long Island don't just lead the country in property taxes, that's not our only calling card. We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

&gt;Clinton: Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-à-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime. It was very upsetting to everybody.

"3690","1460475136","Yeah, this is a good thing. Sorry, but the amount of emphasis placed on testing in the current environment is ridiculous. Kids aren't actually learning anything except how to cram names and dates into their head for one time usage on a test. 

This may actually be one of the first times I've seen the national testing agenda cast as sound progressive policy. A few years ago progressives were falling all over themselves to condemn No Child Left Behind and the emphasis it placed on national testing. Now Clinton's education stance is anti-progressive for opposing the testing culture?"
"3691","1460486343","If you buy the suspect premise of the article that Hillary's refusal to condemn New York's massive (and [massively popular](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/12/nyregion/the-growing-strength-of-new-yorks-opt-out-movement-maps.html?_r=1)) standardized testing ""opt-out"" movement is the equivalent of ""abandoning education reform"" then you should probably know that Sanders has similarly refused to condemn the opt-out movement and has a lengthy history of opposition to standardized testing with language that mirrors the New York opt-outs' own criticisims of the practice:

&gt;I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001, and continue to oppose the bill's reliance on ***high-stakes standardized testing*** to direct draconian interventions. In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on ***standardized testing***, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.

http://www.aft.org/election2016/candidate-questionnaire-bernie-sanders#sthash.8IqrvlNW.dpuf

"3698","1460483536","Hillary visited the [editorial board at Newsday on Long Island yesterday](http://www.newsday.com/opinion/hillary-clinton-at-newsday-long-island-transcript-1.11680010) and a question came up about Common Core, testing and the opt-out movement as testing has become a major issue at the state and local levels. This is the beginning of the exchange, though it expands further:

&gt; **Filler:** So, New York and Long Island don't just lead the country in property taxes, that's not our only calling card. We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

&gt; **Clinton:** Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-à-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime. It was very upsetting to everybody."
"3699","1460507334","It is for all of these reasons stated below that in Europe, they have different levels of high school; tracking not only classes but entire schools. The reality is that you can't teach students that have such a range of ability level. It is just as ridiculous to expect a low achieving students to be able to do the same as a high achieving student ( or intelligent, a word you may never use in the educational system as eveeybody is the same apparently) as it is to expect a 5ft 60lbs girl to wrestle a 6ft 200lbs guy and be competitive. People are limited by their abilities; a good teacher, like a sports coach may have a 10% impact but it can't make a weak student strong. It is ridiculous to hold teachers or schools  accountable for the grades of their students. At our school, we have a large number of immigrants who barely speak english. Their score count the same as those of native speakers. It is all part of the American notion that everybody can achieve anything as long as they work hard. This is high,y naive: students can reach the goals they set for themselves, based on their interests and ability by working hard.
The downside of the European system is that it creates a class society where people at a young age are labeled and start acting and oerforming accordingly. Also, the level of the teachers at the lower level schools is lower because frankly most teachers don't want to work there, because of the behavioral issues. The other downside is that it is negatively biased towards boys, who tend to be behind in development and organizational skills, compared to their female peers. I know tons of freshmen that would have been put in the lower level schools because they can't even bring a pencil with them, who turned out responsible and dilligent seniors a few years later. 
Both systems have their challenges and both do a disservice to large secrion of the student body."

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel Transaction. The 2014 effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership prior to the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

Instead of doing anything to stop these terrible deals that cost us millions for the exact same product, they instead held our military members hostage, stopping them from attending college that gave us better service members while they were in, and gave them better capabilities when they got out so they wouldn't have to rely on government assistance.

&gt; Bunnatine (Bunny) H. Greenhouse is a former chief contracting officer Senior Executive Service (Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. On June 27, 2005, she testified to a Congressional panel, alleging specific instances of waste, fraud, and other abuses and irregularities by Halliburton with regard to its operations in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. She described one of the Halliburton contracts (secret, no-bid contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR)—a subsidiary of Halliburton) as ""the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career"".[1]

&gt; A long-time government employee, Greenhouse was hired by Lieutenant General Joe Ballard in 1997 to oversee contracts at the Army Corps of Engineers. After Ballard retired in 2000, Greenhouse's performance reviews, which had been exemplary throughout her public career, suddenly soured. Greenhouse filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint alleging race and gender discrimination, which her attorney states has never been investigated. In August 2005, she was demoted in what her lawyer called an ""obvious reprisal"" for her revelations about the Halliburton contracts.[2][3]

The real crime is that anyone listens to anything any Democrat has to say on firearms and firearms policy. As a matter of course, the standard assumption is that everything they say is dishonest or at best a half-truth. Sadly, this is not a hyperbolic statement or exaggeration in any way. Which is especially frustrating because there are so many very knowledgeable people who know law, Constitution, research studies, and history, who can accurately discuss public policy and even societal root causes. Heck, a huge number of laymen know the subject matter far, far better than most Democrats attempting to make public policy and law. Take time to ponder that.

To give you an idea of how completely backwards political arena is on firearms, consider the following. When people want expert opinion, they go to experts. When Democrats want expert opinion on firearms and policy, they go to politicians.

&gt;Her statistics come from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issued a report in 2013 saying **Vermont was in fact, adjusted for population, the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states.** That year, 23.5 guns per 100,000 residents, or a total of 147, were recovered in crimes committed outside of Vermont. The next-highest per capita state was New Hampshire, with 22.3 guns per 100,000 residents.

&gt;An ATF report from 2014 put Vermont in the top 15 states whose guns were recovered in New York. Still, it's worth noting that guns from Vermont are just a tiny fraction of the overall number of out-of-state guns recovered there: that year, Vermont's guns were 55 of the total 4,585 out-of-state guns. In the same year Georgia was the source for 386 out-of-state guns and 395 were traced to Virginia.

Here is her quote- ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest **per capita** number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""

So she was wrong about the New York part. But it is true that per- capita, Vermont is the number one source of guns recovered in other states. Which doesn't sound good, but obviously there aren't very many people in Vermont. "

It's so incredibly fucked up that the media will just listen to these facts and agree that it is indicative of her claim without any follow up questions.

As it turns out, *New York* is the state's leading source of illegal guns.  And using a per capita measure is like comparing sourced guns to the number of cattle in a state, or its milk production, or the miles of railroad track.  It's an arbitrary statistic that has no bearing on the number of illegal firearms that enter from out-of-state.  

My gift to Vermont:  Here's a (poorly formatted) list where you fall second to last in terms of *number of sourced guns* vs *annual snowfall*:

&gt; The fact that Kelly and Band were laying the groundwork for their enterprise while Kelly was working for the State Department, reported here for the first time, represents a fresh illustration of the blurring of the lines between Hillary Clinton’s political network and her State Department that critics have long noted. **And it shows how one enterprising fundraiser was able to insinuate himself into Clinton's inner circle and then built a 500-person, multinational consulting firm whose value, at least at first, was greatly enhanced by its founders’ closeness to the Clintons.**

They also said a key element of Kelly and Band’s pitch to new clients was donating to the foundation or joining CGI to “raise your leadership profile.”


&gt; “They used the Clinton connection to launch it,” said a former employee who was there before the public unveiling. “The pitch was: ‘Yes, we’ll be just as good as anybody else at doing the substantive work that you need a consulting firm to do for you — but we’re going to bring all these relationships to the table at the same time.""

Sitting in front of Congress to protest corruption simply makes no sense. Do something that is connected, like underpay your taxes by whatever portion goes towards your representative's paycheck.

Some argue that big names such as Clinton are not persuaded by money due to their enormous influence and already established wealth, but this is very much *not* true for lesser known politicians. If anything, giving politicians and the democratic party MORE money from such groups is exacerbating an already existing problem. They will be knocking on doors for favors once elections are done.

Also, why do you think doing the same strategy of fundraising that's lost us both sides of congress, as well as numerous gubernatorial and legislative branches across the nation, will suddenly start to win? There is a massive progressive movement that has begun, made up of millions of people OUTSIDE the party and young people who don't typically vote. If the Democrats could harness that energy, and seal up up these votes in elections, that in itself would lend enormous power to taking back Congress. 

Some people mock Sanders for putting his need of getting things done in Congress partially on this movement, but the fact of the matter is that without it and regardless of who is in the White House, we can assure ourselves that a repeat of obstructionism we've seen for the last several years will continue. Democrats suck at getting people to vote for them at lower level elections, how does  doing the same exact thing we did before change that?"

Meanwhile, Sanders is virtually running his platform off of small-scale donations, and for that matter (relatively speaking) out-raising Hillary. 
We seriously need to get large-scale corporate money out of politics. Besides, if politicians hate fundraising so much, then shouldn't they be for this type of action? They say we live in a democratic system, so then why not go all the way and only allow for grassroots donations. This would reduce corruption and allow for a more democratic system where the peoples' contributions seriously impact how an election will go for politicians.

&gt;The reality is that Clinton’s plan would barely scratch the surface of the issue. Her proposals are aimed at Citizens United, but as we established, that’s a small piece to a much larger problem. If the Democratic front-runner got her way, corporations would have to disclose their political donations. However, the heart of the matter is far more complex. Her plan doesn’t change that money is speech, nor does it involve tightening the rules of what constitutes “social welfare.” It does not do anything towards regulating 501c4 nonprofits, which would still be able to hide their donors. “Issue advocacy” would still be largely unchecked. Like in the example I gave above, wealthy individuals like the Koch Brothers, who are corporate interests, would still be able to run political “issue” ads through nonprofits with benign names, hiding their identities while pushing a corporate agenda. These individuals would not have to disclose their spending because they are not corporations, nor are they necessarily spending on politics."

"4477","1460500860","Some of the issues DWB and the other organizational signatories to the letter are concerned about with regards to TPP include the following: 

- Enabling pharmaceutical companies to unduly influence government health programs and pricing and reimbursement decisions;

- Requiring countries to grant additional 20-year patents for modifications of existing medicines;

- Providing data and market exclusivity periods that create additional monopoly protections and block introduction of generic competitors, even when there is no patent on a medicine;

- Longer period of protection for biologic medicines—such as monoclonal antibodies that are rapidly becoming the treatment of choice for many cancers, diabetes and other illnesses; and 

- Allowing pharmaceutical companies to sue the US or other governments if health policies or government regulations are alleged to deprive them of anticipated profits. "

And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.""

Basically why should I care that every year there are more and more millionaires. Or that I should care that snapchat sold for Billions of dollars, making many investors and creators very wealthy. 

My opinion is we should be focusing on how to make everyone make that 70k, instead of trying to bring these Titans of Wealth down. 

What is the goal and solution to people who complain about income disparity? "
"4506","1460512183","Am I reading this graph right that there are a lot fewer less-wealthy people and more rich people now vs 1971?  

Other than the lowest income smallest histogram bin, it seems like everyone is better off.  Fewer in the low income bins (under the blue line), more in the high income bins (above the blue line)  If it was a case of purely income inequality growth, the distribution would have gotten a lot more u-shaped.

Edit: I continue to struggle with what point Bernie is trying to make here.  He dislikes that there's more people in the higher income bracket?  There's fewer people in the lower income brackets, which seems like a really great outcome.  The lowest one does increase.  Assuming the bins are even spaced, that would be &gt;$5k.  I wonder what kind of folks are there.  That increase is offset greatly by the decreases in the other ""low income"" bins, though.  The ""middle income"" highlighted area moving up the money axis even conveniently points that out.

Edit2: it seems people don't realize that the y-axis is ""percentage of people"".  When that rightmost bar grows, it's because more and more people are making &gt;$200k, not that the top percentage of people is taking more of the wealth.  (that is likely true, but this isn't the graph that would show that).  All this is showing is that people are making more money than they used to.  Some folks must not know how to read a histogram."
"4507","1460514953","This graph does not really support the argument very well.  It generally shows that everyone is doing better.  It also clearly shows that lumping everyone that makes over $200K is not the most accurate way to show data.

This graph does not show the highest earners income skyrocketing, it shows the number of people who make over $200K skyrocketing, and people's average income rising, which I think we can all agree is a good thing.

The units on this chart are horrible for expressing an argument about income inequality as it simply doesn't show the right type of data.  If you wanted to show a widening income inequality, you should show what the average 1%er makes as a multiple of what the mean American makes."

"4567","1460496927","What annoys me is that all of the voting rights bluster is in the end hypocritical and self-serving.

On the subject of voter ID laws, even if an ID is free and simple to get, we hear INCESSANTLY that it's voter suppression, biased against minorities/the poor/the elderly/immigrants, etc. It's a high-minded and moral crusade. 

I happen to agree that voters IDs are not a good idea, actually.

But boy, when you get to the Democratic (or Republican) **primary**, you are expected to know every rule, regulation, deadline, form, subform, fee, and location. If you trip up on a requirement or start too late, that's on you. YOU should know better, YOU should have been prepared. It's suddenyl not about your rights, it's about your responsibility, your preparation - whether you are *worthy* of placing that vote.

So when we're in the general, having a free ID on you is an unfair and onerous burden, but it's totally fair in a primary to make folks jump through a million little hoops, to be an expert on the process, and to have been preparing in some cases months ago.

Let's be honest - it's because easy voting in the general favors Dems, and difficult voting in the primary favors the default candidate. So, fine. But don't be up in my grill about someone's voting rights when you're taking the complete opposite view during the primary. I see your hypocrisy a mile away.

The default answer to this is ""Parties are private, primaries are private, they can do whatever they want.""  To which I say the two party system is so thoroughly ingrained (and supported by large amounts of public money) that they are de facto public. The other response is that malevolent folks form the other party will flood in and screw with the primary.

Ever notice how when states are about to vote, hillarys numbers fall and bernie closes the gap, not in every case but in the majority of states.

Interview: http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-hillary-clinton-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2596292?cid=bitly

&gt; **Daily News**: Secretary Clinton, I'd like to ask you if I can about Latin-America and the policies specifically you were directly involved in, the coup in Honduras. As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn't do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias adeal for new elections.

&gt; But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There's been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?             
               
&gt; **Clinton**: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent the military to take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people, and that triggers a legal necessity. There's no way to get around it. So our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow walk and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of without calling it a coup.

&gt; So you're right. I worked very hard with leaders in the region and got Oscar Arias, the Nobel Prize winner, to take the lead on trying to broker a resolution. Without bloodshed. And that was very important to us that… Zelaya had friends and allies not just in Honduras but in some of the neighboring countries like Nicaragua, and that we could have had a terrible civil war that would have been just terrifying in its loss of life.

&gt; So I think we came out with a solution that did hold new elections, but it did not in any way address the structural, systemic problems in that society. And I share your concern that it's not just government actions. Drug gangs, traffickers of all kinds are preying on the people of Honduras.

&gt; So I think we need to do more of a Colombian plan for Central America, because remember what was going in Colombia when first my husband and then followed by President Bush had Plan Colombia, which was to try to use our leverage to rein in the government in their actions against the FARC and the guerillas, but also to help the government stop the advance of the FARC and guerillas.

&gt; And now we're in the middle of peace talks. It didn't happen overnight. It took a number of years, but I want to see a much more comprehensive approach towards Central America because it's just Honduras. The highest murder rate is in El Salvador and we've got Guatemala with all the problems you know so well.

&gt; So I think in retrospect we managed a very difficult situation without bloodshed, without a civil war that led to a new election, and I think that was better for the Honduran people, but we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with violence and the gangs and so much else."
"4611","1460506779","I want to know how many people in this sub have actually *been* to Honduras.

I've been many times before and since the coup.  It's a nation full of very proud and very poor people.  We are talking about a people so proud that they fill in their own potholes after church services.  They sweep the sidewalks.  They are performing their own ""civil service"" for nothing, or for the donation of a few Lempiras.  Valuta through an invalid  and outdated currency, but it is still used.  Worth about US $0.05 for each ""Lemp.""  Yeah, a nickel donation.

"4633","1460563552","I really don't understand Sanders on this. Let's go through the checklist.

Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote, and looking ahead into the remaining primaries, will likely only extend that.  And yes, even with the caucuses included, it's still over a 2.4 million vote difference in favor of her. [Source.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/04/06/is-hillary-clinton-really-ahead-of-bernie-sanders-by-2-5-million-votes/)

Hillary Clinton is currently winning the pledged delegate count by over 200, and once again, will only be continuing to add to that in the remaining states. [Source.](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/democrats/)

So, let's take a minute and look beyond this. Let's look beyond Sanders asking the superdelegates to go against the popular vote and delegate count, which is not at all how they work and would be completely undemocratic. Let's say they consider it.

Bernie just became a democrat in [November](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/23/bernie-sanders-democrat/)and did it for coverage. Meanwhile, Hillary was campaigning for democrats as early as [1968.](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/11/395302391/5-things-you-should-know-about-hillary-clinton)

Hillary Clinton has raised [millions](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/clinton-sanders-differ-down-ballot-democrats) for the democratic party, Bernie Sanders has raised 0.

Bernie Sanders says [""We'll see""](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/bernie-sanders-fundraise-down-ballot-democrats-maddow) if he will fund raise for down ticket Democrats in the future. 

Bernie Sanders wanted someone to challenge the incumbent Democratic president in [2012.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/martin-omalley/fact-checking-martin-omalleys-claim-bernie-sanders/)

So, once again. Let's say that in some miracle chance  they overlook the popular vote, delegate count, the fact that Bernie has been a vocal non-democrat until it suited him, the fact that he wanted someone to run against a sitting democratic president, the fact that he has done nothing to raise money for the party and says ""we'll see"" about doing it in the future. Oh, and don't forget that he's now giving the republicans sound bites to air against Clinton in the general (""She is unqualified!"") Even *if* that were to happen, as the article says, he'd still be losing! 

 And, before I get swarmed by angry Bernie fans, yes I know this isn't *technically* over yet and  that polls may change, but the writing is on the wall. Why do you think Sanders himself is pushing this superdelegate nonsense? He knows full and well that it is his only hail mary chance of getting the nomination. At the end of the day, Bernie joined a party - and he is subject to their rules like anyone else is. If he didn't like the system, he could have ran as an independent. "

&gt;There’s no question that by the early 1990s, blacks wanted an immediate response to the crime, violence and drug markets in their communities. But even at the time, many were asking for something different from the crime bill. Calls for tough sentencing and police protection were paired with calls for full employment, quality education and drug treatment, and criticism of police brutality.

&gt;It’s not just that those demands were ignored completely. It’s that some elements were elevated and others were diminished — what we call selective hearing. Policy makers pointed to black support for greater punishment and surveillance, without recognizing accompanying demands to redirect power and economic resources to low-income minority communities.

&gt;Black support for anti-crime legislation was highlighted, while black criticism of the specific legislation was tuned out. "
"4668","1460566465","&gt;Voting records show that many black lawmakers supported some of the most punitive drug-war-era laws in America. But even some people who have long opposed harsh sentencing laws understand where supporters were coming from. The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a longtime pastor in New York, once was addicted to heroin and served time. He's convinced that black leaders who embraced the drug war did serious harm to the community, but says a lot of African-Americans were desperate for ways to make their neighborhoods safe again. ""If you're the victim, then you don't want to hear anything about treatment, just, 'Get this guy off the street.' ""
But eventually, even some of the staunchest supporters of mandatory minimums saw that these policies had badly backfired, in part because they lumped addicts and small-time dealers with drug kingpins and violent gang leaders. And they also consigned countless African-American men to prisons across the country.

"4686","1460485500","Woah there. Gary Gensler isn't merely an ""ex-Goldman Sachs partner"", he's the current CFO and top financial policy adviser of Clinton's presidential campaign, and was a prominent Treasury official under Clinton. 

During his work in the Treasury in the late 90s and early 2000s, he was a key figure in working with Phil Gramm, under Bill Clinton, to revise and sneak the Enron loophole-plagued CFMA into the 2001 omnibus appropriations bill in the last days of the congressional session.

The fact that Clinton hired this guy as one of her top advisers and managers of her national campaign has been very concerning to essentially anyone that has read into this over the past year. 

Better yet, when she hides behind Obama in defense of her enormous financial support from Wall Street, there's a particularly damning fact here: In 2008, congressional Democrats patched up much of the revised CFMA's damage, especially the Enron loophole. In 2009, Obama appointed this guy to chair of the CFTC, the very role which he was instrumental in deregulating via his crucial work in getting the revised (loophole and deregulation-ridden) CFMA passed.

Should be noted that Sanders heavily argued against approving Gensler to chair of the CFTC back in 2009: http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4538740/sen-bernie-sanders-objects-gary-gensler

So not only does Obama's terrible record of financial sector regulation act as a fairly poor excuse for Clinton to raise tens of millions from the same people, but it's all escalated when she decided to hire one of the key players in taking the CFMA from a proper modernization of regulatory provisions to a deregulatory bill (with the Enron loophole) as her top financial policy adviser and campaign CFO."

&gt;On the show last night, Rachel asked the senator himself about the possibility. Initially, Sanders responded by talking about his optimism regarding upcoming contests and some national polling, but he didn’t answer the question directly.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again whether he might try to convince superdelegates to side with him, even if he’s behind in pledged delegates. Sanders said he and his campaign are “going to do the best we can in any and every way to win,” but he still avoided comment on the specific approach he’s prepared to take.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again. For those who missed it, this was the exchange that stood out.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;MADDOW: I’m just going to push you and ask you one more time. I’ll actually ask you from the other direction. If one of you – presumably, there won’t be a tie – one of you presumably will be behind in pledged delegates heading into that convention. Should the person who is behind in pledged delegates concede to the person who is ahead in pledged delegates in Philadelphia?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;SANDERS: Well, I – you know, I don’t want to speculate about the future and I think there are other factors involved. I think it is probably the case that the candidate who has the most pledged delegates is going to be the candidate, but there are other factors."

Clinton travels the country before announcing her candidacy, working out deals where her fundraising spills over into the coffers of superdelegates in return for their pledged support but Sanders trying to convince these superdelegates to switch without bribing them is 'rigging the system'?

&gt; In a February 25 editorial, The New York Times argued that Clinton’s “stonewalling” on the Goldman transcripts “plays into the hands of those who say she’s not trustworthy and makes her own rules” and “most important, is damaging her credibility among Democrats who are begging her to show them that she’d run an accountable and transparent White House.” But the Times editorial did not get to the heart of the matter. The larger question is, Why was she giving these speeches at all—and accepting such hefty payments for them—given Goldman Sachs’s record during the Great Recession of 2007–2008?

&gt; Set alongside such stricken competitors as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, Goldman and its CEO Lloyd Blankfein are the great survivors of the crash: **they actually came out ahead in their own derivatives trading during those years.** Goldman and Blankfein’s admirers, including many in the financial media, have for the most part ignored the bank’s activities during the crash, despite multiple investigations and billion-dollar penalties against Goldman for its aggressive and deceptive marketing of financial derivatives. This has included a $5 billion settlement levied against the bank this January. **How does this fit with Clinton’s self-portrayal as an opponent of the big banks and their excesses who is committed to their reform?**

&gt; ...

&gt; As the primary season reaches the crucial contests in the northeast and in California that will likely decide the ultimate victor, the dual history linking Goldman and the Clintons poses two questions that still need to be answered. First, should Lloyd Blankfein remain CEO of Goldman Sachs in view of the bank’s central involvement in the deceptive marketing of securities during the crash? Second, should he, and Goldman, remain the valued associates of Hillary Clinton, with both Clintons receiving inflated speaking fees from Goldman, and with Hillary Clinton performing what amounts to a high-end public relations effort for the bank, even as she styles herself as a reformer of the financial industry? **As long as Clinton refuses to reveal the content of her Goldman speeches, the suspicion will remain that she has cast a blind eye on Goldman’s dark years and that her campaign pledge to “rein in Wall Street” cannot be taken seriously.**"

"4788","1460613758","Oh, he could do it.  Slap a tariff on all incoming products to raise their price to make them inline with what a person in the US making the same product costs.  Prices would go up, but you'd have jobs.   Of course, you'd have to put tariff on products from US companies to prevent them from moving the same jobs overseas.  You'd then have you're manufacturing producing all the products that the US needs.  Because the prices have gone up (remember the 40% tariff on Ford?) the demand for the products would go down as few people could afford few products.   Basic economics there.  And out products would no longer be even remotely competitive on the international market, which would split marketing between the US and overseas -- so the companies moving jobs overseas would continue to move jobs overseas and selling those products overseas to avoid the tariffs (last time I checked, ford just didn't sell cars in the US, but all over the world including China).    So you'd get jobs, but the prices would be higher, demand would go down, reducing the job growth -- up until the companies could automate the production in the US -- at which time the jobs would disappear again.  

But -- by golly we gains some jobs for a little while.   Eliminated taxes on the rich, plunged our economy into a recession again but this time didn't expand any of the safety nets and eliminated health care for 16+ million (before the recession).   But it could be done if you really wanted to do it.

You can not buy a gun on the internet and get it mailed to your house.

edit:

And let me go ahead and address the lie that the evil republicans are blocking progress on ""important gun safety legislation"".

A republican senator proposed an NRA approved universal background check bill.   
Harry Reid blocked it from being voted on.   

Republicans are currently trying to pass a bill that would make it more difficult for the mentally ill to get guns.   The Democrats are trying to torpedo it because the bill still requires due process to strip someone of their rights.    

The antiguners are the ones who refuse compromise.    
They would prefer nothing be done so they can continue smearing the republicans and gun rights proponents.    "

"4845","1460642819","And they're preaching about allowing families to sue gun manufacturers...

This is stupid and they have just lost credibility with me."
"4846","1460648836","Let me try to address a few things in the article.  

&gt;“Since the tragedy in Sandy Hook, more than 500 children have lost their lives to gun violence in this country.

I'm not going to claim this is untrue.  I will ask, ""what specific changes to the law would have prevented all children who have died since Sandy Hook from dying?""  We have lost children in hot cars, but they are not trying to ban cars in the summer.  We have lost children in swimming pools, but I don't see them trying to ban swimming pools. We've lost children to ""shaken baby syndrome"" when cared for by babysitters, but I don't see them trying to make it illegal to babysit without background checks and proof of child-care training.

Losing children to gun violence is just one small way we lose children, and not the largest cause of child death.  It's used here as an example because, well, most people have an emotional response to the thought of dead children.  ""oh, if we just made more laws, then drug dealers would not shoot bystanders with illegally obtained guns as part of their illegal turf wars...""  

&gt;A few months after the Sandy Hook tragedy, the Senate rejected a bill that would have expanded FBI checks of gun purchasers to include sales by individuals on the internet and at guns shows.

This would probably be because it's already illegal to sell guns to anonymous people over the internet.  Dealers who sell at gun shows must already do background checks.  Private individuals who do not have businesses selling firearms are **not able** to perform background checks, no matter where they sell their guns, because they are barred from using the NICS.  What is being proposed here is making it illegal to buy and sell guns unless one is a dealer, or goes through a dealer with a full background check for every sale.  That's the ""gun show loophole"" that they want.  The physical location of a sale, being in one's home or at a gun show, isn't actually part of the ""gun show"" loophole; that's just a convenient bit of misdirection that anti-gun advocates use to confuse low information voters.  It should be termed the ""private sale loophole,"" where they want private sales of property governed by the feds.

&gt;Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., spoke about a bill he and Murphy introduced earlier this year that would repeal a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers and dealers from liability when crimes are committed with their products.

If we ignore the idea that this targets the firearm manufacturers specifically and just think of these as ""manufactured devices,"" then it becomes clear that they are asking for it to be illegal to sue General Motors if someone speeds in a General Motors car.  Or, sue a pharmaceutical company if someone overdoses with a drug - any drug.  Too much aspirin? Sue Bayer, because they make aspirin.  Is that foolish?  They want to sue the company that makes the guns that the police use if someone commits a crime with the kind of gun the police use.  That's clearly what they want.  Should the companies that supply the police be at jeopardy every time they sell the police a weapon, if that weapon is stolen and then used to kills someone?  That's very bad legislation, and should not have been considered.  This is what the riders here want to be passed.  

&gt;Blumenthal said the “abhorrent” law “closes the courtroom doors” to lawsuits like the one filed by some of the parents of the children killed in Newtown against the maker of the Bushmaster rifle that was used by Adam Lanza in the massacre.

Last year (or the year before) an FBI Agent lost his service firearm and it ended up on a Pier in San Francisco.  It was then used to kill a young lady, seemingly at random.  I suppose it should be okay to hold the manufacturer of that firearm accountable for her death?

A company's incorporation is about as significant as the area code on your cell phone. Some locations are preferred because they are more commonly used when setting up different levels of stock, have more case law and therefor the paperwork is easier to file, and have different protections for investors and/or founders.

A GOP legislator in Tennessee who is pushing for the same anti-Trans legislation there was just declared ""a danger to unsuspecting women"" in an official warning by the Attorney General.  

The Speaker of the House was forced to move the guy to a place where he can't attack women.

&gt;According to the report, women said that they “avoid or refuse to be alone with Representative Durham, a situation which has affected their ability to perform their jobs.”

North Carolina will lose millions because businesses that offer high-paying jobs won't set up shop in a state where bigotry is the law of the land.  North Carolina's hospitality industry will also lose millions because because convention planners won't do business with the state for the same reason.  They refuse to send their clients into hostile territory.

The state could very well lose additional millions defending this law, with taxpayers ultimately footing the bill.

"5120","1460518661","He stands to benefit from this trip more than the other candidates, Dem or Republican, would.

First, there are voters who decided to support Hillary many months ago, back when Bernie was relatively unknown, who haven't felt motivated to revisit that decision.  They recognize Bernie's name and might know a few superficial things about him, but they don't know enough to evaluate him as a candidate.  Bernie's invitation to the Vatican is unique and interesting enough to inspire some of them to look him up and learn a bit more about who he is.

Next, the problems of greed and inequality are at the core of Bernie's message.  The same is true of Pope Francis.  While Francis has not endorsed Bernie, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to notice that similarity.  This will cause more voters to view Bernie's platform from a moral perspective instead of a purely economic or political perspective (i.e., not just, ""Would it be good for me?"" or ""Is it politically possible?"" but, ""Is it the right thing to do?"").  It will surely cause some people to view his message in a religious context.

And that is especially important for Bernie, the first non-Christian presidential candidate that I'm aware of, certainly the first to get this far.  The media doesn't talk about it, but we all know that he's lost some votes because he's Jewish.  A nod from the Vatican, however slight, is just what he needs to soften that prejudice.

Finally, he has been constantly diminished by the media.  This Vatican trip elevates him; he'll be attending alongside heads of state.  He is the first US presidential candidate in history to receive such an invitation.  It will make him seem more presidential and impressive."

Why has such a large chunk of the party that settled on Bill Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry suddenly decided they’d rather have a ritual re-enactment of the McGovern campaign?""

I mean, let's not pretend that this paragraph is a gross distortion to what's factually true. Clinton is losing ground solely because of herself, that's the bottom line. The reason Bernie is gaining so much traction with the American people is because he is the most honest and trustworthy candidate in the race. He is the only one who is willing to address the real issues we face today. He strongly advocated tax reform and campaign donation reform. Ever since Ronald Reagan the country has been going through a state of deregulation of big business. Every president that succeeded the last has deregulated the system making it easier and easier for big business to gain more and more influence. Citizens United and the whole super pac problem needs to be addressed and Bernie is the only one advocating it...while Clinton takes millions from big business with open arms. 

We now live in a society far different from what we were told. Ever since I started school I was told we lived in a democratic republic based on capitalism. This is far from the truth. We live in a society where the 1% are the ones who bribe candidates and use these candidates to solely benefit them. To my knowledge this kind of system is called an Oligarchy. We were born into an oligarchy without even knowing and we believed it up until now.

"5147","1460484601","Assuming that the campaigns will be given tickets to then give out to guests, this will be another strategic victory for Hillary. When it comes to the debates and especially the town halls, in which tickets were given out by the campaigns, there are always instances where Hillary looks out into the crowd in the middle of a response and says something like ""I think *so and so* is here, yes, he/she is"" and then goes on to talk up something her and that person have worked on together or at least a way to hoist up that person to the audience and TV viewers. This does many things. One of the most prominent examples was when, during a town hall in South Carolina, she asked mothers who had lost children to gun violence to stand up. The camera panned out, showed the several mothers, and there was an extended period of applause.

Being that this will be in NY, I expect her Sen. Schumer to be in the audience, as well as Cuomo and especially de Blasio. She will point to them for things like the $15 minimum wage, lower crime rates, stricter gun laws (to then hit Bernie). There will also be city council members and borough presidents, who she will also find a way to connect to and bring attention to them. This is how you build loyalty and ensure that they (considering some are super delagates) continue to support you no matter what. But it also helps her with people who know and trust the more local officials to then say ""oh, maybe I should like her too!""

Anyways, this is just one of those seemingly small, but effective, communication strategies that her campaign has mastered. Bernie's campaign has no answer for it."

I see absolutely nothing wrong with that statement."
"5222","1460651783","It's a real risk.  Clinton and the DNC can focus on the optics of the perceived sexism all they want.  It doesn't change the fact that there were 27k people at that rally, and they didn't boo, they cheered, loudly.  Because sure, hours afterwards you can pick apart the vocabulary to find something to quibble over.  But you can't deny that the core message is exactly how people feel.  

And I'd be careful about putting that core message on a megaphone just to try to pick apart one small part of the wording, because that message resonates way deeper than the criticism.  This is by no means the first or last time people compare sell-out politicians to whores.  Shine a light on it, and some might take offense, but most people might just say to themselves ""Hey, at least a whore only sells herself out for money, and that's not such a bad thing.  A politician sells out other people."""

&gt;1:  a woman who engages in sexual acts for money :  prostitute; also :  a promiscuous or immoral woman

&gt;2:  a male who engages in sexual acts for money

&gt;3:  a venal or unscrupulous person

He meant 3, not 1 or 2.

He's sending coded messages to his supporters that Clinton is not just wrong, but literally evil and corrupt.  And they've internalized that and are now using language designed for social pariahs instead of for a mere political disagreement.

The media will then make the case that you guys (""you guys"" because, let's be honest, it's only Sanders supporters here) will be impossible to talk back off the ledge, though I don't know if I really buy that.

 - Friends with Hillary at Yale Law
 - Special counsel to Bill Clinton
 - Spokesperson for the White House under Bill Clinton
 - Involved in Bill Clinton's impeachment trial
 - Supported Hillary in 2008

"5459","1460647637","[My comment from another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4er2zx/the_bernie_sanders_double_standard/), this seems to be the narrative of the week:

&gt; He forgets to mention that 28 other Democratic senators also voted for that resolution, including Joe Biden and John Kerry. 

Well, he is running against only HRC at the moment, so he is just contrasting between himself and HRC.

&gt; Clinton has said many times that she made a mistake on that Iraq War vote. 

This is why her judgement is called to question, because Libya still happened, if she truly believed Iraq was a mistake then Libya would not have repeated those same mistakes.

&gt; Again, notice that Sanders rarely mentions Obama’s name as a target of criticism, such as for the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But he does strongly criticize Clinton for changing her mind after her early support of the TPP,

Again, Sanders is running against Clinton not Obama, why should he contrast himself with Obama?

Why are we gonna need a shit ton of coal? Because nuclear power is 19% of our grid and natural gas is a large amount too. And we want to be transitioning to renewables at the same time. 

But renewables won't be able to possibly come on line fast enough to cover our growing need for electricity if we really want to make all our cars ect electric as well. This means in the meantime, more coal, and more OIL imported from around the world, include Saudi.

This ban would be the most damaging thing to the american working class jobs in history. That is 10,000,000 jobs in the industry he wants to get rid of? 

Absolutely ridiculous proposal that just shows Sanders has no idea about the economy and only wants to ponder. "
"5572","1460509811","Sanders proposed ban is dangerous and wrong-headed economically, geopolitically, and environmentally. It represents the triumph of fantasist thinking over actual reasoning. Frankly this more than anything he had said exposes him as an ideologue who prioritizes his vision for the country over the well-being of the people who actually have to live here. 

I know that sounds ridiculous. But:

On the economics: fracking as a technique has driven an enormous supply shock in both oil and nat gas industries. That means lower prices for any given volume of demand. That means a giant progressive tax reduction since poor people spend proportionately more on fuel, power, and hearing. 

More consequentially, before people knew you could extract oil and gas from source rock using fracking, people thought you would have to get it from very difficult to reach reserves like deepwater, the Arctic, and oil sands. Those reserves are dangerous to work and our technology sometimes led to very large problems (eg deepwater horizon and Macondo). Moreover, many of those reserves are in bad places that are hard to regulate. 

Fracking has led to a collapse in prices and a huge shift of capital and drilling away from these reserves, usually owned by national oil companies in states that don't like us or that we wouldn't want to support, to the US. If fracking went away, we'd be back to $100 oil, $7 gas, and massive rent extraction by Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Saudis, etc. 

The US reserves are a very powerful strategic weapon. We should be approving gas export terminals every time Putin gets nasty to put pressure on the Russian dominance of European gas. We are already pressuring bad actors everywhere. I don't want American soldiers defending petrostates that are despicable because we need the resources. Now, with fracking, we largely don't. 

On the environments, no question fracking is worse than solar or wind. But if regulated properly it can be made at least palatable and still be economically viable. And having access to cheap natural gas domestically allows us to transition faster from coal and build rapid firing gas plants to make up for wind or solar facilities if the wind stops or it gets cloudy. 

Prospectively, a world with fracking is a world where we can pass a carbon tax and still take revenues and power away from bad state actors and exceptionally dirty resource plays and manage it closely in the US. I want us to be off oil and gas in 40 years for fuel and heating and power -- that would be the bulk of the use, though it doesn't solve cow farts-- and I want us to use our own resource for as much of that time as possible. If we support domestic production and implement good regulations plus a carbon tax, you will get both a rapid transition away from fossil fuels and a safer planet. 

Sorry about length. This is just dumb policy and I think it matters a lot that we get it right. "

For one, a 51%-49% win does little to change the overall delegate count.  And right now Sanders needs ""real change"" in the delegate count.  He can't bank on California to overturn the entire deficit in pledged delegates.

Two, New York, while big, is only slightly bigger than his deficit in delegates.  Sanders would still be behind in delegates even with a big win in New York.

I'll answer that for him because Sanders isn't going to answer it and his supporters are only going to weave you another fucking web of lies:

If Bernie Sanders loses NY by the numbers all the polls are showing (13-20%), then his campaign goes from improbable to impossible. Yes, impossible. The Bernie Sanders crew will tell you ""nothing is impossible if you dream hard enough!"" Or ""nuh uh! He has a 5% chance of winning! That's hope!"".
It's not. 

Unless this is your first rodeo, you know how primaries and elections work. You know that nobody recovers from a loss that huge. You know that with a lead that fat, the supers will stay with Hillary. You know and are aware that Sanders has MAJOR weaknesses when it comes to campaigning and he probably won't be able to recover from the 300 delegate deficit after NY. You know that Hillary is going to absolutely win Indiana, Maryland, DC, Pennsylvania... Those states alone will deliver all the delegates Hillary needs to win. If she wins Maryland 60-40, it's wraps. If she wins PA by 55, it's wraps. If she wins Indiana by 50%, it's wraps. 

Another way to put it:He just isn't going to win in a meaningful way. If Bernie loses New York by the margins predicted (or by more), it will have erased almost all the gains he made all of March and early April. If she goes on to take PA like she's forecasted to, then she finishes erasing the Sanders wins and then pads her own lead... Again. Losing NY will mean Sanders has to win by a margin of 60% from here on out.


And he Berned through his favorable states with very little to show for it. They'll downvote me to shut me up, you can be guaranteed of that. But Jesus Christ, people in this sub ought to and need to hear the truth. This place is such a tight echo chamber people actually believe this race is close/neck and neck.

&gt;This is pretty common. Businesses incorporate in Delaware more than any other state, and a lot of those businesses don't actually have a physical business in Delaware. They need an address for service of process reasons, and so there are companies set up that just act as agents for that reason at one address. Every state has at least a few companies that are service of process agencies that will have thousands and thousands of companies listed under their address. Incredibly normal and honestly, not in the least bit shady. I help set up entities every day that are completely above-board that we use these types of agencies for. As an attorney, I am obligated to do what is legally permissible that is in my clients best interest. It's no different here.

&gt;*Edit: I should also note that setting up a business entity, which is more than likely pass-through and it is taxed as ordinary income, for consulting, receiving fees, etc. is not unusual in the least. I would have recommended that to every single one of my clients in their position, and I'm honestly surprised it took Bill until 2008 to set his LLC up.

&gt;**Edit part deux: There have been a lot of statements with the general tone of ""It's not about whether it's legal, it's about whether it is ethical,"" in regards to organizing entities in Delaware vs. their home state. My response to that would be two-fold:

&gt;First, the smallest and the largest of companies organize in Delaware not really for tax benefits, but because of the Court of Chancery and the extensive case-law Delaware provides (if she was setting up the limited liability company as a tax-haven, she would have organized it in Nevada--not Delaware). Over half of the companies organized in America are organized in Delaware, so they have judicial rulings on almost every aspect, whereas many states will have issues that have never even been brought before their Courts. It's all about certainty and speed. The Court of Chancery is incredibly quick (as is the Delaware Sec. of State's office) in resolving issues. Something that would probably take a year to litigate in California might be a few weeks in Delaware. In addition, they are constantly updating their statutes to correct and ambiguities or conflicting provisions--things other states just don't do. There are some banks that will only lend to companies organized in Delaware because of the certainty of their laws and court rulings. If you want businesses to organize in your home jurisdictions, then I beg you to encourage your state legislature to pour more money into our back-logged court system.

&gt;Second, and I can't stress this point enough, I guarantee you the most likely reason that their entities were incorporated in Delaware was probably because that's what their attorneys and accountants told them to do. There are some tax benefits for her to set up an LLC to receive revenue from her book deal in Delaware, as intangible assets aren't taxed (which is why a lot of bands, artists, consultants, authors, etc. will set up LLCs in Delaware), but the savings are likely not that huge. The biggest reason is probably because that is the jurisdiction her attorney's and accountants are familiar with and it makes their life a shit-ton easier. The type of LLC she set it is probably considered a ""disregarded entity"" anyways and is essentially treated as a sole proprietorship.

&gt;***Edit Part Trois: This is more a personal thing--I am a Bernie Sander's donor, volunteer, and even a state delegate for him. However, as several individuals have pointed out, a lot of my comments are essentially ""If you love Bernie Sanders for his policies, do whatever you can to help him win the nomination, but IF he doesn't--please for the sake of all that Bernie cares for, vote for Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination."" That's because I'm a pragmatist with idealist tendencies. And for me, the only issue is the Supreme Court. Go through my past comments and you will find a giant list of cases that were decided 5-4 which were harmful to the poor, to minorities, and to the average American and beneficial for the rich and corporations. The Supreme Court is basically all I've talked about since even before Scalia died. Bernie Sander's policies, progressive legislation of the past and future, and essentially everything liberals have fought for since the 1930s is under threat or has already been destroyed by a conservative Supreme Court. Don't give it another 30 years to keep undermining our Democracy.

&gt;Go read Sander's book ""An Outsider in the House"" beginning on page 24. Replace ""Bill"" with ""Hillary"" and ""Dick Armey"" with ""Paul Ryan"" and you have Bernie Sanders explaining exactly why I would support a Hillary Presidency if she gets the nomination vs Trump, Cruz (who is the most dangerous of any candidate in decades), John Kasich, or even Paul Ryan. This election is too important for a protest vote for me. So call me a shill for Hillary--I'll keep donating and working for Sanders regardless--but for the love of God, stop posting baseless smear shit like this or you are the same as Rush Limbaugh.

Yes, we all know how great Delaware is for business, yes we *know it's legal to operate like this*, but like many things this isn't a pull that the American people should have to continue to swallow.

Two things; one, it was racist. I don't care that you say this shit with your friends when nobody is looking, or that you are married to a black woman and your kids are mixed race. It was racist.

Would it not be grand for the nation if at the least Bernie can really  establish the Socialist party and maybe Trump can establish the Libertarian or other right party? It really does look like the elites, who really have no party we are all finding out, want Hillary in as the Democrat and Kasich or Ryan in as the Republican.  Probably Ryan since he is pulling his lie about NOT wanting to be President, just like him not wanting to be speaker. Guess who the speaker is?

There are ""progressive"" politicians who want to divide the next inevitable step into ever smaller steps. That way they can keep something to campaign with for next time, and a way to make it seem like their party has a pattern or track record of working on whatever the issue is (guns, environment, healthcare).  

If they had passed gun reform rather than making small incremental moves toward it (a bullet here, a bullet there), than we'd have a lot less politicians who could claim to have ""worked on gun reform"" over the past few decades.  But we'd have gun reform.  

But they don't want to give us everything all at once.  It would add a level of uncertainty to the future of the party that they can't commit to.

This is what's happening with Single Payer Healthcare.  There are politicians that don't want to give up the potential to run on ""working towards single payer"" for the next few elections.  They want to step on it, break it down into smaller parts, cut it (with some stuff that gets their donors paid), and give us the most diluted form of healthcare that we will buy.

&gt;Sanders aides told reporters that he may not be able to catch Hillary Clinton through the primary/caucus delegate process, but the campaign might come close, at which point Team Bernie might ask superdelegates to give Sanders the nomination anyway, even if he’s trailing Clinton after voters have had their say.
&gt;
&gt;On the show last night, Rachel asked the senator himself about the possibility. Initially, Sanders responded by talking about his optimism regarding upcoming contests and some national polling, but he didn’t answer the question directly.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again whether he might try to convince superdelegates to side with him, even if he’s behind in pledged delegates. Sanders said he and his campaign are “going to do the best we can in any and every way to win,” but he still avoided comment on the specific approach he’s prepared to take.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again. For those who missed it, this was the exchange that stood out.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;MADDOW: I’m just going to push you and ask you one more time. I’ll actually ask you from the other direction. If one of you – presumably, there won’t be a tie – one of you presumably will be behind in pledged delegates heading into that convention. Should the person who is behind in pledged delegates concede to the person who is ahead in pledged delegates in Philadelphia?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;SANDERS: Well, I – you know, I don’t want to speculate about the future and I think there are other factors involved. I think it is probably the case that the candidate who has the most pledged delegates is going to be the candidate, but there are other factors.

&gt;Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine made the case Wednesday on a call with reporters that, despite pledged delegates getting their spots based on Democratic votes in primaries and caucuses, they are free to switch which candidate they represent based on personal preference. He pointed to the Jimmy Carter campaign in 1980 and said that before Carter won the Democratic nomination, the campaign was “deeply concerned about the defection of pledged delegates.”
&gt;
&gt;“We don’t have a plan at the moment to be calling all the Clinton delegates, you know, once they get selected and try to persuade them individually to be for Bernie Sanders,” Devine said when pressed by a reporter. “But we do believe that if we can succeed in the second half of the process as much as Hillary did or even more so, that there will be enormous pressure on people who are going to be delegates at this convention to do the right, responsible thing.”"

If people took the time to read the article and see the video, the evidence is apparent that the system is rigged in Hillary's favor.


&gt; Although Sanders won by 12 percent, however, Clinton ultimately won more total delegates. Factoring in superdelegates, Clinton won 11 and Sanders won just seven.



&gt; But it was not just the superdelegate count that was unfair. There are 14 pledged delegates in Wyoming, meaning, given Sanders won 56 percent of the vote, if the voting system were proportional, he should have gotten at least eight delegates.



&gt; In the end, however, Sanders and Clinton tied on pledged delegates. Sanders, who won the primary by 12 percent, won the same number of pledged delegates as Clinton, who lost by 12 percent.

Is there a limit to how many wives a man can have? Can they all file taxes jointly and get a huge discount? Can a sister wife marry another man, too? Are sister wives married to each other? What happens if wives disagree on end-of-life care for their husband? Can one sister wife make medical decisions for another's child? Does a state like Utah need to make accommodations for the scores of extra single men who will be unable to find wives, as happens in China and India when males are in excess? This is besides the taint of association with secretive religious cults like FLDS.

It's a lot more complicated than the first-stage consideration of private association. "

Dear REPRESENTATIVE XXXX,

I am writing you today in support of Representative Rick Nolan's motion to declassify 28 pages of the 9-11 Commission's official report in the hope that you will do the same. As the most serious attack against the United States since Pearl Harbor, the terrorism of September 11th obviously holds an eminent place in our minds. Doubly so given that we have embroiled ourselves in what is now our third war related to the events of that tragic day. 

Consequently, it is essential that the American people have full knowledge of the circumstances and history of September 11th. It is only when we are fully informed that we will be able to make the important decisions required of a democratic electorate. There is no place for the sort of paternalism which would withhold critical information out of the fear that the voters are not equipped to reliably interpret it. To admit as much is a rejection of democratic principles.

If those 28 pages about the financing of the September 11th terrorists should reveal some shocking fact about our allies in Saudi Arabia so be it. Perhaps they should not be our allies after all.

Sincerely,

YYYY"

They *wanted* Obama to win in 2008, because he was at least a ""true"" Democrat with populist appeal.  They *do not* want Sanders to win because he is not a ""true"" Democrat, no matter his populist appeal.

It looks to me like Vox did an intentionally poor job of differentiating whether they meant more than you currently pay for healthcare or more than you pay in taxes.  

Then they chose the least reasonable interpretation of the question to work with.

They asked ""how much more would you pay for health insurance for everyone?""

Then wrote an article as though they'd asked ""How much more in only taxes would you be willing to pay and have your employer pay directly and indirectly if neither of you had to pay any non-tax money for healthcare?"".

Even they admit:

"6497","1460641026","&gt; Sanders knows that President Obama took large donations from Wall Street and had a big political action committee.

Has no relevancy whatsoever, especially considering that many have criticized Obama's positions with respect to Wall St.

&gt; And Sanders omits the undisputed facts that both Obama and Clinton take positions strongly opposed by Wall Street interests

Perhaps this is true with respect to the single issues they go on to cite but with respect to the totality of their positions on Wall St. it certainly is disputed whether they are strongly opposed.

&gt; Sanders also never mentions that Paul Krugman, the Pulitzer-prize winning progressive columnist for The New York Times, has described Clinton’s stance on Wall Street reforms and accountability as more effective than Sanders’s proposals.

This is how you know the author is being absurd. Why the fuck would Sanders acknowledge what one economist thinks of his *opponent's* stance on Wall St. unprovoked?

&gt; The Iraq War vote: Sanders says this showed flawed judgment by Clinton when she voted for the war resolution 13 years ago. But here’s the undeniable double standard: He forgets to mention that 28 other Democratic senators also voted for that resolution, including Joe Biden and John Kerry. Does Sanders say the vice president and the secretary of State, both of whom served multiple terms in the U.S. Senate, are not qualified to be president, because of flawed judgment? Even once? No.

More ""they did it too so it must be OK"". This author has the critical thinking skills of a child.

&gt; Supporting virtually every trade agreement: Again, notice that Sanders rarely mentions Obama’s name as a target of criticism, such as for the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

&gt; Clinton has said many times that she made a mistake on that Iraq War vote. 

This is why her judgement is called to question, because Libya still happened, if she truly believed Iraq was a mistake then Libya would not have repeated those same mistakes.

&gt; Again, notice that Sanders rarely mentions Obama’s name as a target of criticism, such as for the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But he does strongly criticize Clinton for changing her mind after her early support of the TPP,

&gt; **Daily News:** Secretary Clinton, I'd like to ask you if I can about Latin-America and the policies specifically you were directly involved in, the coup in Honduras. As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn't do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias adeal for new elections.

&gt; But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There's been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?

&gt; **Clinton:** Well, let me again try to put this in context. The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent the military to take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people, and that triggers a legal necessity. There's no way to get around it. So our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow walk and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of without calling it a coup.

&gt; So you're right. I worked very hard with leaders in the region and got Oscar Arias, the Nobel Prize winner, to take the lead on trying to broker a resolution. Without bloodshed. And that was very important to us that… Zelaya had friends and allies not just in Honduras but in some of the neighboring countries like Nicaragua, and that we could have had a terrible civil war that would have been just terrifying in its loss of life.

&gt; So I think we came out with a solution that did hold new elections, but it did not in any way address the structural, systemic problems in that society. And I share your concern that it's not just government actions. Drug gangs, traffickers of all kinds are preying on the people of Honduras.

&gt; So I think we need to do more of a Colombian plan for Central America, because remember what was going in Colombia when first my husband and then followed by President Bush had Plan Colombia, which was to try to use our leverage to rein in the government in their actions against the FARC and the guerillas, but also to help the government stop the advance of the FARC and guerillas.

&gt; And now we're in the middle of peace talks. It didn't happen overnight. It took a number of years, but I want to see a much more comprehensive approach towards Central America because it's just Honduras. The highest murder rate is in El Salvador and we've got Guatemala with all the problems you know so well.

&gt; So I think in retrospect we managed a very difficult situation without bloodshed, without a civil war that led to a new election, and I think that was better for the Honduran people, but we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with violence and the gangs and so much else.

"6506","1460466170","Well, me try put this in context, Clinton is an imperialist with the blood of thousands upon thousands of Hondurans on her hands. Incidentally, she's wrong about the law as the wikileaks emails prove that even the DOS in Honduras believed this to be an illegal coup and called it as much in their own private channels. Outside of the US, there was unanimous agreement amongst our peers that the Honduran military had acted illegally. More importantly though, HRC has no remorse over any of the people that she has hurt over the course of her career, specifically as secretary of state. She has no problem lying to you and saying that her reasons for not using the word coup were humanitarian - as opposed to serving the financial interests of the oligarchs who constructed the coup and subsequently lobbied the State Department for preferential treatment. 

That's why I'm never voting for her, regardless of who wins the Democratic primary."
"6507","1460438665","So the Honduran president is removed at gunpoint by his military and sent into exile. You are SoS, do you:

A) Demand the immediate return of and installation of power to the president even if it risks igniting a civil war between presidential loyalists and the clearly armed and ready to act opposition.

B) Show full support to the new post-coup leaders. Despite them taking power through an armed coup.

C) Call for immediate new elections assuming that the installation of a new democratically elected leader will defuse the clearly armed and ready to act opposition while maintaining democracy.

D) Ignore it. Honduras is Honduras's problem."
"6508","1460441389","&gt;Nevertheless she strongly rejected the idea of cutting U.S. aid for Honduras, claiming this would have harmed the Honduran people, although it is mainly directed to the country's security forces.

Gross negligence is a different standard than negligence.  Negligence is the failure to use ordinary care.  Gross negligence is reckless conduct that is much more culpable than negligence.

Many states criminalize gross negligence that injures a person, but I don't think any criminalize ordinary negligence.  So if you are in a car wreck you might be liable if you were negligent (not paying attention, for example).  But it is only criminal if it is gross negligence, which would be driving 100 mph in a school zone or driving with your eyes closed or something like that.

Being a leader isn't all about your ideas - anybody can have a good idea - but being a leader does mean knowing when to put the people you are leading ahead of yourself.

I am on the fence on both of these candidates. But I can tell you one thing, it is extremely hard to overlook Hillary's habit of passing the buck; it's never her fault. She also has a habit of putting political gain ahead of ethics, of compromising her own stances for her own benefit, and has a track record of sub-par decision making.

Bernie is a one-issue candidate, and I don't agree with him on everything. But Bernie also seems to recognize that he isn't the dictator of this country, and I trust him more than Hillary to put trustworthy lieutenants into place who know their jobs better than he does. His goals are unrealistic, but is character is not.

I was heavily undecided until recently. I am making the choice to support Bernie - not because I believe in his politics, but because he represents a type of leadership we've been lacking for a long time. Someone with morals, and character, and ethics. And if the worst that comes from that is nothing gets done then so be it, at least I stood for something.

If you were to look at the past, as in FDR, back in those days the media covered for a president with a medical issue, helping him to hide it from the public.  In todays world, the president would never win re-election with his health in question, and the press that covered it would be labeled as 'chairgate' conspirators.  That is the state of politics today, and because of how effective it is, it is never going away.

In todays society, we demand that our politicians be pure.  I mistake, and they are gone.  Look at Rudy Giuliani.  That dude had the White House in the bag.  Then, one day, at a press conference, he made the press wait while he took a phone call from his wife.  That one little smug act cost him everything.  His numbers plummeted and he fell away into obscurity.  Look at Romney, he was chugging right along, and then he made a comment about the 47 percent'.  Game over.  Look at McCain... he was busting his ass on the trail, and then instead of picking a beltway insider as his VP, he chose Palin..... game over.

Politics is a fine game of character, and character assassination.  It matters not what you say, if your word is good for nothing.  Those who are willing to turn a blind eye towards a character flaw in a candidate in this day and age..... are going to suffer that person's mistakes.

This seems theft of a very low kind--the richest country in the world reaching into the economies of poorer countries to take funds that by right belong to them.  It is quite......imperial really.

"
"6717","1460394052","The challenge with taxing overseas profits is that other corporations in those markets are not paying US tax rates. This means the US itself, would be making US companies less competitive compared to foreign companies in foreign markets.

Since the US has the [2nd highest effective corporate tax rate in the developed world](http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Special-Reports/Paying-Taxes-2014.pdf) and 15th highest of 189 countries analysed...if we taxed foreign profits at US tax rates, we would be ensuring that our companies are disadvantaged in almost every foreign market in the world."
"6718","1460417058","With child-like wonder you all applaud these efforts, but you don't see the issue on the horizon.

How many of you know that the so called Nordic socialist countries have a much lower corporate tax rate than the US?  Or that Singapore, South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Japan all carve out tax shelters for their national champions?

China is destined to become the world's biggest economy in 25 years, if not sooner.  I don't mean by purchasing power parity measures ... I mean in absolute terms.  China will be the biggest market, and the US might even fall to third behind India.

Domination of foreign markets is in the interest of the US both from an economical point of view, and also a military point of view.  Having national companies that are dominant players in the most dynamic and competitive markets ensures that the nation's technology will remain ahead of competitors.

The US tax code is a terrible mix of loopholes and high rates.  If companies actually paid the US's ridiculous tax rates, they could not exist in competition with foreign companies.  They need the loopholes just to compete.

When margins are slim, even a small tax increase can mean the difference between profitable and unsustainable business.

The issue is that Sanders and his supporters don't understand that business is international and that markets are everywhere.  For sure you could force US companies to stay at home by making their foreign tax rates so high that they can't compete with anyone.  Then you would have to raise high tariff walls to keep foreign companies out of the US market, so US companies could survive at least in the domestic market.

But then you will have committed to tariffs and a protected market.

In the long run, the world outside the protected market will move on and leave the US far behind.  Markets outside the US won't be so protected and soft as the US market.  They'll be bloody and vicious.  In those markets companies will become lean and will evolve quickly.  Their technology and products will be better, because they will have to get better just to survive.

It'll be like when the Japanese Shogun shut off Japan from the outside world because he didn't like muskets and wanted to protect the sword-wielding Samurai.  Well, the outside world didn't stand still.  The outside world had bloody competition, and when the US came back a century later with warships and canons, the Japanese were far behind.

50 years of Sanders-type of tariffs, and high taxation, and our grand children will have a bunch of musket companies trying to face off against machine gun companies outside the US.

You want an example of this, see the history of India's auto company called Hindustan Motor Company (which made the Ambassador car).  Compare the Ambassador car in the year 2012 to any other car in that year.  That tells you the effectiveness of protecting national champions, instead of forcing them to compete abroad (with the best products and tax rates)."

Why is this important? Well if Ford were to make themselves a one massive legal entity like the lot of you are suggesting it makes the company liable for penalties in multiple juristictions and taxations in such
 For example if ford were to become one giant single entity what laws would it adhere to? Where would it pay its taxes?

Not exactly who I'm going to for analysis frankly.

&gt;In the entire forced dump of Clinton’s emails, you will be hard pressed to find a single one sympathetic toward the Jewish state from any of the people she relied on. 

Not really.  I've only read a fraction of them, and I've seen many about what the US needs to do to help Israel.

edit: Notice how the article provides no actual quotes?  They could very easily provide the entire emails themselves to put them in context, but instead just make vague references.

&gt;Sandy Berger was Clinton’s foreign policy adviser during her 2008 presidential campaign. In September of 2010 he sent her ideas on how to pressure Israel to make concessions for peace. Berger acknowledged “how fragile is Abbas’s political position,” and how “Palestinians are in disarray,” and that “failure is a real possibility.” Berger was well aware of, and informed Hillary of, the very real possibility that Israel would be placing its national security at grave risk in a deal that would very likely fail and lead to a Hamas takeover.

&gt;**But Berger felt the risks to Israeli lives were worth it.**

&gt;He advised the need to make Netanyahu feel “uneasy about incurring our displeasure....”

&gt;Berger emphasizes the need “to convince the prime minister – through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure – to make the necessary compromises” and talks of the “possibility – to turn his position against him.”


Sounds like Berger was just talking about standard negotiating?  I notice the point about ""Berger felt the risks to Israel lives were worth it"" isn't an actual quote, unlike the rest. 

edit: [I found the email in question - I don't think the author got the date correct](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_August_Web/IPS-0093/DOC_0C05771036/C05771036.pdf)

&gt;Anne Marie Slaughter was Clinton’s director of policy planning from 2009-2011. She wrote to Clinton in September of 2010 and devised a scheme to encourage wealthy philanthropists to pledge millions to the Palestinians (which no doubt would have been embezzled by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his cronies as were other funds).

&gt;She wrote: “This may be a crazy idea.... Suppose we launched a “Pledge for Palestine” campaign... Such a campaign among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world would reflect a strong vote of confidence in the building of a Palestinian state....”

&gt;She adds: “There would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis who, would be building settlements in the face of a pledge for peace.”

&gt;Clinton’s response to this email: “I am very interested- pls flesh out. Thx.”

[How is this anti-Israel?](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_NovWeb/08627IA2/DOC_0C05775206/C05775206.pdf)

&gt;Robert Russo, one of Clinton’s aides and currently her campaign’s “director of correspondence and briefings” sent an email in April of 2012 informing her of Netanyahu’s father’s death and advising her to give him a condolence call. Included with Russo’s email is an extremely biased article attacking both Netanyahu and his father, describing them as virulently racist warmongers and calling the elder Netanyahu “a behindthe- scenes adviser to his son, the most powerful person in Israel.”

&gt;The article noted that “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly denied that his father was a one-dimensional ideologue. He further emphasized that he himself was a different person from his father.”

&gt;But then it goes on to say, without providing any proof whatsoever, “Israelis seemed in the dark about the extent of paternal influence on their leader,” and “To understand Bibi, you have to understand the father.”

&gt;**One might be forgiven for questioning Clinton’s sympathy and sincerity when she later placed the call and gave Netanyahu her condolences.**

Can we be forgiven for assuming the author is incredibly biased or blatantly misleading?  [The author is bitching about a NYT story (note: wikileaks link)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/4845)

&gt;Thomas Pickering, former US ambassador to Israel, wrote to Clinton on December 18, 2011, and suggested a secret plan to stir up major Palestinian protests in an attempt to force the Israeli government into peace negotiations.

[Decide for yourself.](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_OctWeb/231/DOC_0C05790860/C05790860.pdf)

&gt;This idiotic reasoning that somehow only women would participate and things would stay peaceful is obviously absurd. As Pickering himself notes, “Palestinian men will not for long patiently demonstrate – they will be inclined over time and much too soon to be frustrated and use force. Their male culture comes close to requiring it.”

Pickering *didn't* say that only women would participate - he stressed that it was important that only women should - else it would turn violent."

"6827","1460391754","Bernies Sanders supporter and business/Corporate attorney here...

This is pretty common. Businesses incorporate in Delaware more than any other state, and a lot of those businesses don't actually have a physical business in Delaware. They need an address for service of process reasons, and so there are companies set up that just act as agents for that reason at one address. Every state has at least a few companies that are service of process agencies that will have thousands and thousands of companies listed under their address. Incredibly normal and honestly, not in the least bit shady. I help set up entities every day that are completely above-board that we use these types of agencies for. As an attorney, I am obligated to do what is legally permissible that is in my clients best interest. It's no different here.

*Edit: I should also note that setting up a business entity, which is more than likely pass-through and it is taxed as ordinary income, for consulting, receiving fees, etc. is not unusual in the least. I would have recommended that to every single one of my clients in their position, and I'm honestly surprised it took Bill until 2008 to set his LLC up.

**Edit part deux: There have been a lot of statements with the general tone of ""It's not about whether it's legal, it's about whether it is ethical,"" in regards to organizing entities in Delaware vs. their home state. My response to that would be two-fold: 

First, the smallest and the largest of companies organize in Delaware not really for tax benefits, but because of the Court of Chancery and the extensive case-law Delaware provides (if she was setting up the limited liability company as a tax-haven, she would have organized it in Nevada--not Delaware). Over half of the companies organized in America are organized in Delaware, so they have judicial rulings on almost every aspect, whereas many states will have issues that have never even been brought before their Courts. It's all about certainty and speed. The Court of Chancery is incredibly quick (as is the Delaware Sec. of State's office) in resolving issues. Something that would probably take a year to litigate in California might be a few weeks in Delaware. In addition, they are constantly updating their statutes to correct and ambiguities or conflicting provisions--things other states just don't do. There are some banks that will only lend to companies organized in Delaware because of the certainty of their laws and court rulings. If you want businesses to organize in your home jurisdictions, then I beg you to encourage your state legislature to pour more money into our back-logged court system.

Second, and I can't stress this point enough, I guarantee you the most likely reason that their entities were incorporated in Delaware was probably because that's what their attorneys and accountants told them to do. There are some tax benefits for her to set up an LLC to receive revenue from her book deal in Delaware, as intangible assets aren't taxed (which is why a lot of bands, artists, consultants, authors, etc. will set up LLCs in Delaware), but the savings are likely not that huge. The biggest reason is probably because that is the jurisdiction her attorney's and accountants are familiar with and it makes their life a shit-ton easier. The type of LLC she set it is probably considered a ""disregarded entity"" anyways and is essentially treated as a sole proprietorship.

***Edit Part Trois: This is more a personal thing--I am a Bernie Sander's donor, volunteer, and even a state delegate for him. However, as several individuals have pointed out, a lot of my comments are essentially ""If you love Bernie Sanders for his policies, do whatever you can to help him win the nomination, but IF he doesn't--please for the sake of all that Bernie cares for, vote for Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination."" That's because I'm a pragmatist with idealist tendencies. And for me, the only issue is the Supreme Court. Go through my past comments and you will find a giant list of cases that were decided 5-4 which were harmful to the poor, to minorities, and to the average American and beneficial for the rich and corporations. The Supreme Court is basically all I've talked about since even before Scalia died. Bernie Sander's policies, progressive legislation of the past and future, and essentially everything liberals have fought for since the 1930s is under threat or has already been destroyed by a conservative Supreme Court. Don't give it another 30 years to keep undermining our Democracy.

Go read Sander's book ""An Outsider in the House"" beginning on page 24. Replace ""Bill"" with ""Hillary"" and ""Dick Armey"" with ""Paul Ryan"" and you have Bernie Sanders explaining exactly why I would support a Hillary Presidency if she gets the nomination vs Trump, Cruz (who is the most dangerous of any candidate in decades), John Kasich, or even Paul Ryan. This election is too important for a protest vote for me. So call me a shill for Hillary--I'll keep donating and working for Sanders regardless--but for the love of God, stop posting baseless smear shit like this or you are the same as Rush Limbaugh."

I initially agreed, because after reading the law a second time (remember...only five pages) there was no language about those that have undergone sex-reassignment surgery.  After looking a little more I learned that in North Carolina, you have a right to change your birth certificate to reflect your new gender.

I have now given more customers to (local?) competing businesses, who will, with their increased business and revenue, expand and eventually **edge out** my  business, as they will get more customers and therefore money. Enough people will boycott and not attend my business to the point that I would lose money quickly, and **be forced to either close or change policies.**

I discriminate as to who my friends are, based on their attitude, appearance, and maybe even a little on their pregnancy status (I believe that having a child, especially at a young age, is stupid, immature, and is a red flag to both employers and *a friend.*). or, **How  is my (private) discrimination of friends any different from my (private) business?** What sets them apart, as both of them are my choices/""property?"""

"6903","1460577079","&gt;Expanded trade with China over the past 15 years has cost the United States at least 2 million jobs. Cracking down on trade with China, by taxing the cheap consumer goods it ships to our store shelves, could cost millions of additional jobs


Great start to the article. It's straight to the point -- anti-trade would cost millions more jobs than free trade. 

&gt;3. Getting tougher on trade would supercharge the U.S. economy.

&gt;Trump’s economic plan boils down to cutting taxes and renegotiating trade deals, including the nonexistent China agreement. He told The Post he could generate revenue to pay off $19 trillion in federal debt within eight years without raising taxes. “The power is trade,” Trump said. “Our deals are so bad.” Sanders suggests the same thing in calling for his own protectionist policies: “We should have a trade policy which represents the working families of this country, that rebuilds our manufacturing base.” **As leverage to cut better deals, Trump has threatened tariffs on China and Mexico. Sanders has also raised the threat of tariffs.**

&gt;Economic models don’t generally predict that such ideas would rev up the U.S. economy, though — quite the opposite. **A model by Moody’s Analytics, prepared at the request of The Post, predicts that Trump-style tariffs would push our economy into recession and throw millions of Americans out of work.** A more optimistic model, from economist J.W. Mason of the Roosevelt Institute, estimates that tariffs would probably reduce America’s gross domestic product by about 1 percent — not a huge effect but also not the growth boom that opponents of free trade predict. "
"6904","1460577297","That's about right.  Thought to be fair to Sanders, the **underlying** elements that make this a voting issue (income inequality and labor market disruption in long-standing industries) are things democrats actually have an answer for.  Minimum wage laws and social services are real policies that can treat this.

Trump just wants to ban trade because it drives votes.  That can only make things worse."

"6915","1460618969","&gt; Detroit, Mich., Jan. 5. -- Henry Ford, head of the Ford Motor Company, announced today one of the most remarkable business moves of his entire remarkable career. In brief it is:
&gt; 
&gt; To give to the employees of the company $10,000,000 of the profits of the 1914 business, the payments to be made semi-monthly and added to the pay checks.
&gt; 
&gt; To run the factory continuously instead of only eighteen hours a day, giving employment to several thousand more men by employing three shifts of eight hours each, instead of only two nine-hour shifts, as at present.
&gt; 
&gt; To establish a minimum wage scale of $5 per day. Even the boy who sweeps up the floors will get that much.
&gt; 
&gt; Before any man in any department of the company who does not seem to be doing good work shall be discharged, an opportunity will be given to him to try to make good in every other department. No man shall be discharged except for proved unfaithfulness or irremediable inefficiency.
&gt; 
&gt; The Ford Company's financial statement of Sept. 20, 1912, showed assets of $20,815,785.63, and surplus of $14,745,095.57. One year later it showed assets of $35,033,919.86 and surplus of $28,124,173.68. Dividends paid out during the year, it is understood, aggregated $10,000,000. The indicated profits for the year, therefore, were about $37,597,312. The company's capital stock authorized and outstanding, is $2,000,000. There is no bond issue.
&gt; 
&gt; About 10 per cent of the employees, boys and women, will not be affected by the profit sharing, but all will have the benefit of the $5 minimum wage. Those among them who are supporting families, however, will have a share similar to the men of more than 22 years of age.
&gt; 
&gt; In all, about 26,000 employees will be affected. Fifteen thousand now are at work in the Detroit factories. Four thousand more will be added by the institution of the eight-hour shift. The other seven thousand employees are scattered all over the world, in the Ford branches. They will share the same as the Detroit employees.
&gt; 
&gt; Personal statements were made by Henry Ford and James Couzens, Treasurer of the company, regarding the move.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is our belief,"" said Mr. Couzens, ""that social justice begins at home. We want those who have helped us to produce this great institution and are helping to maintain it to share our prosperity. We want them to have present profits and future prospects. Thrift and good service and sobriety, all will be enforced and recognized.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Believing as we do, that a division of our earnings between capital and labor is unequal, we have sought a plan of relief suitable for our business. We do not feel sure that it is the best, but we have felt impelled to make a start, and make it now. We do not agree with those employers who declare, as did a recent writer in a magazine in excusing himself for not practicing what he preached, that 'movement toward the bettering of society must be universal.' We think that one concern can make a start and create an example for other employers. That is our chief object.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""If we are obliged,"" said Mr. Ford, ""to lay men off for want of sufficient work at any season we purpose to so plan our year's work that the lay-off shall be in the harvest time, July, August, and September, not in the Winter. We hope in such case to induce our men to respond to the calls of the farmers for harvest hands, and not to lie idle and dissipate their savings. We shall make it our business to get in touch with the farmers and to induce our employees to answer calls for harvest help.
&gt; 
&gt; ""No man will be discharged if we can help it, except for unfaithfulness or inefficiency. No foreman in the Ford Company has the power to discharge a man. He may send him out of his department if he does not make good. The man is then sent to our 'clearing house,' covering all the departments, and is tried repeatedly in other work, until we find the job he is suited for, provided he is honestly trying to render good service.""

"6917","1460503756","Based on a multilevel analysis of nearly 120,000 observations across 31 countries between 2001 and 2008, we provide novel insights into the moderating effects that economic inequality may have on the distinct roles that human and financial capital play on different types of entrepreneurship. As inequality increases, both forms of capital become weaker deterrents of entry into necessity entrepreneurship, whereas for opportunity entrepreneurship, only financial capital becomes a stronger predictor of entry. We also show that, regardless of inequality levels, both human and financial capital exhibit decreasing marginal returns on the likelihood of entry into necessity entrepreneurship, and that in the case of opportunity entrepreneurship, financial capital exhibits increasing marginal returns. However, inequality does impact the magnitude of marginal returns. Additionally, our statistical analysis provides quantitative support to extant literature arguing that higher levels of economic inequality foster both types of entrepreneurship albeit having a stronger impact on necessity entrepreneurship, and that human and financial capital have distinct effects on entry into necessity versus opportunity entrepreneurship. All these findings have pertinent policy implications and shed light on the under-researched role of inequality on entrepreneurship."

The author of the scientific study has admitted that his results were incorrect and has apologized for the consequences.


&gt;And while the Supreme Court in Miller struck down mandatory life-without-parole sentences for children, thousands of kids remain sentenced to die in prison as states fight retroactive application of the decision to sentences imposed during the height of the superpredator panic.

3000 US chidren are in jail for the rest of their lives for crimes that comitted when they were minors.
Children as young as 10 can be prosecuted as adults in some states.

"7017","1460478623","After taking power, the Bush administration declared war on voter fraud, making it a ""top priority"" for federal prosecutors. In 2006, the Bush Justice Department fired several U.S. attorneys who refused to pursue trumped-up cases of voter fraud in New Mexico and Washington. In September 2008, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice stated that some of the dismissals were motivated by the refusal of some of the U.S. Attorneys to prosecute voter fraud cases during the 2006 election cycle. According to Conservatives, community organizers like ACORN were actively recruiting armies of fake voters to misrepresent themselves at the polls and cast illegal ballots for the Democrats. While ACORN was found to have committed fraud, it wasn't any of the type that would affect the outcome of votes. ACORN was found guilty of paying their employees bonuses for registering 21 or more people to vote in a day, or a few employees faked primary petition signatures that overwhelming passed without the fake signatures. Voter ID laws can't stop this, or any other type of voter fraud, except in-person fraudulent voting. In-person voter fraud is when a person or persons use false registrations to obtain ballots and vote one or more times in an election. That is the ONLY type of voter-fraud that can be stopped by voter ID laws.

A major probe by the Justice Department between 2002 and 2007 failed to prosecute a single person for going to the polls and impersonating an eligible voter. Sure, over the 5 years 86 people were convicted, but almost every case were people who mistakenly filled out registration forms or misunderstood eligibility rules. These cases almost exclusively involved immigrants and former felons who didn't know that they were ineligible to vote because of their felony conviction.

There is no significant voter-fraud problem in the United States. Rather, these voter ID laws are rather attempts by Republican majorities to stifle and suppress the number of minorities and poor people who go to the polls. Minorities and the poor just happen to overwhelmingly vote Democratic. I am not even talking about other restrictions, such as removing early voting or making it harder to restore voting rights. Stephen Colbert recently had a fantastic segment in March called ""People who are destroying America"" which was the story of a Florida high school teacher who was fined $1,000 for ""voter registration fraud"" after failing to turn in student voter registration forms within the state's new 48-hour deadline. Now, these measures were tossed out by a Florida Judge who called them ""onerous"", but if the GOP had its way, performing your civic duty can now put you on the wrong side of the law.

This isn't the first instance of Republicans attempting to keep Democrats from voting, especially if you include the southern Democrats who became Republicans after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Republicans trying to drive Democratic voters away from the polls is not something that is new. As Paul Weyrich, the co-Founder of the Heritage Foundation, a Conservative Think-Tank, stated in 1980, ""I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of the people. They never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down."" The American Legislative Exchange Council, the fine people who brought the ""Stand your ground"" laws that became such a big controversy in the Trayvon Martin case, is also the organization that created the template for these voter ID laws. This organization is funded largely by the Koch brothers who were the key bankrollers of the Tea Party movement.

Anyone who has stood on the long lines at the DMV knows that it isn’t easy to get such documents or honestly find the time. My driver's license broke in half earlier this year, and to get it renewed. When I showed up to the DMV and there was literally a line of 42 people. I decided to not wait the estimated two hours and instead come back the next day and give myself plenty of time. I had to wait 3 hours to get my driver's license renewed. Luckily I have a job that is flexible and allowed me to do that--unlike some people. What do you say to the people who work at places like Labor Ready (day labor job center) that begin waiting in line at 4am for work and don't finish until after 7pm? Many of these people work 6-7 days a week at these hours. For working people, obtaining a proper ID could mean giving up a day’s wages, which many can't afford. The New York Times reported:

""A survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that 11 percent of citizens, 21 million people, do not have a current photo ID. That fraction increases to 15 percent of low-income voting-age citizens, 18 percent of young eligible voters and 25 percent of black eligible voters. Those demographic groups tend to vote Democratic, and Republicans are imposing requirements that they know many will be unable to meet."""

"7022","1460594938","Because when you live in a country filled with minorities who commit the majority of murders, you realize that gun control just means that law abiding white people will lose their guns, and dangerous criminals become the ones with the illegal guns.  "
"7023","1460592905","So if you want gun control it's because you are racist and want to restrict minorities from having guns.

But also if you don't want gun control it's because you are scared of minorities and racist.

So basically we are back to if you are white you are racist? Do people even still listen to the nonsense the left pushes?"
"7024","1460595539","Pretty much all gun control starts with wanting to deny guns to minorities. Originally prohibitionists were open about it, especially in regards to the red scare. Then in the 1980s and 1990s when racism fell out of fashion the excuse was to get rid of automatic guns because they were (in pop culture) only used by black gangsters. Nowadays they just opt for a poll tax via firearm licensing, which means that you have to be able to read at a 12th grade level in order to purchase a firearm in some states. Given the deplorable state of our K12 system this basically means that minorities have an even more difficult time legally obtaining weapons especially if their first language isn't English."
"7025","1460636992","Aside from  [gun control being historically racist](https://www.firearmsandliberty.com/cramer.racism.html)

"7026","1460471766","Without getting in to the Israel-Palestine conflict itself (note: most would call me pro-Palestine), this article is fairly misleading. The author writes that:

&gt; Clinton called into question the innocence of dead Palestinian civilians, arguing, “They often pretend to have people in civilian garb, acting as though they are civilians, who are Hamas fighters.”

&gt; Maybe Clinton was referring to the 551 children Israel killed in Gaza, 68 percent of whom were under the age of 12. Or maybe she was talking about the 844 Palestinians that the Associated Press determined were killed in Israeli airstrikes on residential homes, including 19 babies and 108 preschoolers between the ages of 1 and 5.

This is an intentionally bad reading of Clinton's statement. All she said was that Hamas has disguised its fighters as civilians, making it difficult to tell who is a civilian. But the article makes it out like Clinton is saying that Palestinian babies killed in Israeli airstrikes were asking for it because they resembled Hamas fighters. This article's intellectual dishonesty makes it completely useless at shedding light on the Israel-Palestine conflict, which is unfortunately par for the course when it comes to journalists covering the Middle East. "
"7027","1460476435","&gt;In the midst of Israel’s 51-day assault, Clinton accused Hamas of “stage-managing” media coverage of the slaughter by inviting Western journalists to Gaza. She also recycled Israel’s excuses for its attacks on UN schools by alleging – without providing evidence – that Hamas was firing rockets from their grounds.

Inviting journalists to report = stage managing, a glimpse inside the Clinton's mind."
