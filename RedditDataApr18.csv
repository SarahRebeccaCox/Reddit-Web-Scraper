"2","1460992750","People seem to forget that the reason why social issues divide the parties now is that under Reagan the religious right became a primary constituency of the Republican party. Prior to the Voting Rights Act, social issues were not a relevant cleavage, mainly due to the fact that liberal Democrats coalitioned with southern (conservative) Democrats. As southern Democrats retired, they were replaced with southern (conservative) Republicans who barely changed policy positions but were more religious. The Democratic party was left with mainly northern liberals. As southern (former Democrats and new Republicans) and traditional Republicans largely agreed on fiscal policy, they were free to diversify on social issues. The Democrats, being largely liberal, had no control of the executive for 12 years (Reagan to HW). So to win back the executive, it makes sense that a more moderate Democrat was nominated (Clinton). However, the radical policies supported by Gingrich and the new conservative caucuses in Congress merely pushed Republicans farther to the right. Movement to the right incentivized Democrats to move to the left, but this really has only been seen on the social issue spectrum. The parties have both moved economically right the midpoint of the two party policies has largely remained largely very 'neo-liberal'.

Honestly, few politicians have different economic policies. Few dispute the free market as a useful mechanism, including Bernie. Separation is between advocating laissez-faire (Republican) or a tightly regulated  free market (Democrat). No one is advocating market socialism or anything actually radical. When people argue against free trade, it's more advocating no new trade agreements and some modifiers to existing agreements, not the reintroduction of tariffs. 

So is H. Clinton a moderate Republican? On economic policy, few aren't. On social policy, hell no. "

Some highlights:

'In many areas poverty and its attendant ills afflict large numbers of Americans. Distrust and fear plague us all. Our inner cities teem with poor, crowded in slums. Many rural areas are run down and barren of challenge or opportunity. Minorities among us—particularly the black community, the Mexican-American, the American Indian—suffer disproportionately.""

""Air and water pollution, already acute in many areas, require vigorous state and federal action, regional planning, and maximum cooperation among neighboring cities, counties and states. We will encourage this planning and cooperation and also spur industrial participation by means of economic incentives.""

""Our metropolitan transportation systems—the lifelines of our cities—have become tangled webs of congestion which not only create vast citizen inconvenience, discontent and economic inefficiency, but also tend to barricade inner city people against job opportunities in suburban areas. We will encourage priority attention by private enterprise and all levels of government to sound planning and the rapid development of improved mass transportation systems, Additionally, in the location of federal buildings and installations and the awarding of federal contracts, account will be taken of such factors as traffic congestion, housing, and the effect on community development.""

""A vigorous nation-wide drive against trafficking in narcotics and dangerous drugs, including special emphasis on the first steps toward addiction the use of marijuana and such drugs as LSD; 
Total commitment to a federal program to deter, apprehend, prosecute, convict and punish the overlords of organized crime in America, including full implementation of the Congressional mandate that court-supervised wiretapping and electronic surveillance tools be used against the mobsters and racketeers...""

""We pledge to encourage the broadening of private health insurance plans, many of which cover hospital care only, and to review the operation of government hospital care programs in order to encourage more patients to utilize non-hospital facilities. Expansion of the number of doctors, nurses, and supporting staff to relieve shortages and spread the availability of health care services will have our support...""

I could go on, but the point is, from fiscal &amp; military positions, Hillary is absolutely a Nixonian/Reagan Republican. More Nixon than Reagan, in my opinion. Obviously she's progressive socially, but I think that's a reflection of the changing base of American voters, as social issues have long tended to be utilized to pander to a specific portion of  the base, and it's impossible to be a Democrat in 2016 without championing social issues."

"20","1460999166","I'd like to address this issue that the Clintons have betrayed the Democratic party, because they shifted the party rightward (third way politics). They didn't betray the Democratic party. They resurrected it. 

The Roosevelt Democrats, and Democrats in general, got destroyed in presidential elections for a long time. McGovern lost an extremely lopsided election in 1972. Jimmy Carter served one term in 76. He only won that because he was an evangelical and Nixon scandalized the Republican party. Then Reagan dominated the next two election cycles. And then bush got the Republican party a third term. America was no longer interested in Roosevelt Democrats. They lost lop sided elections. The Democrats needed to reform themselves, and the Clintons did just that. 

I can appreciate how much you guys like Sanders, but the amount of hate I see on here for Clinton is counterproductive. She's a million times better than Ted Cruz, and she wouldn't win a single vote in a Republican primary.

Why do you think conservatives hate him? It's not his stance on Islam that makes the GoP scared to nominate him (Cruz is just as racist, if not more so).

And he plans to beef up border security like Clinton and Obama did (while Bush cut border security). The owners of the Democrats love walls because they stop non-unionised labor; the owners of the Republican Party love illegals otherwise because they'd have to pay minimum wage for their maids and gardeners.

&gt;... more and more Americans are tired of voting for a politician simply because he or she is less ghastly than the other party’s candidate.

First-Past-the-Post voting is one of the major roots of the issue and must be removed from use and operation. It essentially forces both candidates, representatives, and society itself into angry, extremist positions. That's not what we're about. That's not what we stand for. We are better than that. We can do better. 

[Range and/or Approval voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4a5ijh/privacy_sos_fbi_quietly_changes_its_privacy_rules/d0xt6nt) is where we need to move for the betterment of not only the nation, but the world, as well. We deserve better.  

With Range and/or Approval voting:

* People can still vote *exactly the same* as FPtP, if they want to.

* Requires *no new* voting machines *or* constitutional amendments (very important).  

* First-Past-the-Post voting doesn't give the electorate and representatives a chance to be more than binary nutcases, practically. FPtP voting forces both the people and representatives into black and white, extremist-esque thinking.

* If changing the voting system wouldn't help at all, as some like to argue, then there's no good reason not to advocate for changing it to something that *allows and provides for more expressivity and nuance.* &lt;------ the whole point and reason for having elections is to express preferences to the best of our ability, hello? express yoself! treat yoself! quit being robotic! 

* There's no good reason, no reason that doesn't fly in the face of liberty, freedom, and/or representative democracy not to go to something like **Range and/or Approval voting** - two methods that undoubtedly give our better nature's - our better selves - a chance to vote and be represented.

Obama spends 6 of his 8 years as a lame duck, of course the party is going to move to the right. Republicans have been sabotaging the economic recovery and shutting down the government and Obama never got any reinforcements in the midterms. 

People think that not voting for Democrats sends them a message to be more liberal when it in fact does the opposite. Conservatives vote reliably.

Bernie Sanders is from Vermont, a major producer of *maple syrup*. The Canadians want to make Sanders president so that they can form a global maple syrup cartel.

If you combined the two, you'd get a maple syrup BEHEMOTH with 92.7% of all exports. You could form a cartel that would make OPEC look like the Mickey Mouse Club.

"96","1460986843","Ok, but what else is he supposed to say?  That the polls are right and he'll lose a pivotal state?  Right now his best option to keep people hyped and try to keep supporters from not showing up out of apathy.

Basically some people have looked closer at some of the polls showing Clinton up big, and they had smaller samples and tended to focus on areas that were very pro Clinton in 08 or comically biased demographically for Hillary.

These polls mean literally nothing if the powers of delegation in the primary process are still invested entirely within the establishment.

"171","1460989215","It seems very difficult for Presidential candidates to understand that regime change and nation building does not work. It begs the question: if its not that they don't understand, but if they have more to gain from constant instability and war than peace?

Foreign policy in the Middle East may not be at the top of my issue list when it comes to voting, but a candidate's stance on the Middle East can tell so much about their critical thinking and skill at interpreting history.

To me, this issue effectively disqualifies the current crop of Republican candidates from the White House. The Republican party is so terribly hung up on Islamophobic/terrorist fear mongering that they're effectively committing to an eternal campaign of immensely expensive strategic bombings, subvertive regime changes and tell-tale ""limited operations"" on an already colossal financial deficit."

"175","1460996004","So here's my take on Syria for the longest time:

If you are going to take a side, take a side that you want to win that could credibly do it. 

So far we've done very little in terms of side taking, HRC is talking about doing a little more. But most of the side taking has been along the lines of ""We will fuck up isis, because we want them to lose,"" and ""We will fuck up Assad, because we want him to lose."" 

Who do we want to win? I dunno, there's a couple groups in syria that are kinda secular. Sometimes they band together into larger groups but sometimes they fight each other. And some of them aren't as secular in practice as we were lead to believe when they were asking for weapons. So it'd be cool if one of them could win maybe? As long as it's not Isis or Assad. Then maybe all these heavily armed people will put their weapons down and have elections. 

That is not a strategy. That doesn't move the conflict to an end game. Picking losers without picking winners is a recipe for perpetual war. 

The Russians picked Assad as a winner. He has a significant military and a significant territory and a united organization within his sphere of influence. You and I may disagree that he's an appropriate choice, but it IS a choice. It is a strategy. It has a goal that if successful moves the conflict towards an end. It even allows for less ambitious end games such as ""We will ensure the Assad government, and therefore our interests, have considerable voice in some power-sharing agreement."" It is easy to imagine a spectrum of acceptable end-games for Russia. 

To anyone who disagrees with my assesment I ask, ""Who are we backing? What is their name?""

The journalists called BS when the White House claimed the U2 spy plane was simply a meteorolical survey plane. The White House later confessed it was a spy plane.

The media weren't merely tools to spread the propaganda of American exceptionalism, etc. They cut no corners in highlighting where the US was lagging, or highlighting where US policy was amoral.

Kennedy would explain his foreign policy decisions honestly and frankly to the American people.

The civil rights movement cheered when the national guard was deployed - because it was there to protect their demonstrations. What a far cry from Ferguson or Baltimore.

The Washington March was huge yet allowed to proceed undisturbed. In marked contrast to the demonstrations last week when hundreds were arrested.

We need the Bernie movement to go on also after the Presidential elections. We need to demand that democracy is restored in our country. Not just in election processes but also with regard to transparency, accountability and reminding our elected leaders they work for us, not the other way around."

In 1998 Sanders voted in favor of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which said: “It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.”

Later that same year, Sanders also backed a resolution that stated: “Congress reaffirms that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic  government to replace that regime.” These measures gave congressional backing for the CIA’s covert plan to overthrow the Hussein regime in Baghdad, as well as the tightening of an economic sanctions regime that may have killed as many as 500,000 Iraqi children. The resolution also gave the green light to Operation Desert Fox, a four-day long bombing campaign striking 100 targets throughout Iraq. The operation featured more than 300 bombing sorties and 350 ground-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, several targeting Saddam Hussein himself.


So.... Everyone thinks Hillary is the biggest to blame as first lady during the crime bill or as a senator who voted for the authorization of the US to use military intervention in Iraq... but don't forget that Sanders also made very similar, if not the same, decisions."

"241","1460990020","&gt;    Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones.   

&gt;The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organised political society.

&gt;This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.
   
&gt;**Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education).** It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

The other issue, which holds more water, is that democrats are being switched to unaffiliated without their knowledge/consent. I'm definitely interesed to see if this is true/widespread. The only example provided was the woman who says she unknowingly waived her party affiliation after hurricane sandy when there was an emergency measure to allow people to vote in any precinct. I'd want to see some corroborating stories that this happened to others after hurricane sandy though, and that it was truly ""hidden"" (for some reason?). The only official quoted just says that so far all the cases investigated have been errors on the part of the people registering.

 And finally the article really goes to great lengths to imply this is to intentionally hurt Sanders. But quietly changing the registration of people who've been democrata for years seems more likely to hurt Clinton. Or at least as likely. How would the people purging the affiliations know who that person was going to vote for? Especially if it did occur in 2012 after Sandy.

After the mining company received a favorable outcome in its negotiations with the Congo, Kabila's government paid Bill Clinton $650,000 for basically nothing.

EDIT: With apologies, the Congo offered $650,000, but the State Dept. rejected Bill's request to go. As the following article indicates, this appeared to be the exception not the rule. Most requests appear to have been approved by the State Dept. with only cursory scrutiny.

President Kabila was reportedly present during the abusive interrogation, which apparently took place on a farm he owns near Kinshasa. Afroamerica News describes its source for the beating story as an unnamed “official close to Rwandan President Paul Kagame.” For the record, the parliament speaker was not my source for that article nor is he among the sources for this one. This beating is just one more alleged injustice of the Kabila regime.

&gt;Initial findings suggest that a significant percentage of New York voters are experiencing problems with voter registration leading up to the 2016 presidential primaries. Most commonly, this has involved unauthorized changes to registered party affiliation, though there have been a number of other relevant complaints. Regardless of whether these problems are the result of technical or clerical error, Election Justice USA will soon be filing a lawsuit to ensure that this issue is addressed BEFORE the New York presidential primary election on April 19th. If your voter registration information has been affected in any way, please fill out the following form.

"355","1460936428","&gt;1,299 to 1,105.

&gt;That’s the “insurmountable” delegate lead Hillary Clinton has over Bernie Sanders.

&gt;And there are still 1,674 pledged delegates yet to be awarded in twenty primaries and caucuses to be held over the next two months; scores of up-for-grabs delegates yet to be decided via state and county Democratic conventions; and hundreds and hundreds of super-delegates to be wooed by both candidates in Philadelphia this summer — with not a single one of them having officially committed themselves to anybody.

&gt;That’s the cold, hard truth — the indisputable numeric data of the current election cycle — but it’s not the story Americans are being told.

No kidding."
"356","1460947803","This analysis is wrong.

Colorado was net 6 delegates for Bernie, not +6 for him and -6 for Hillary (would have been net 12 in that case), and Missouri results are not final, and likely depends on rules interpretation at the state convention. The 206 number on 538 is the best estimate we have as of right now (might be 202 or 198 though, depending on interpretation of rules in one or both of Nevada and Missouri).

This is what happens when you decide to believe an English professor on delegate totals over Nate Silver."
"357","1460944975","It's funny to read Seth Abramson, an English professor and one of the biggest hacks this election cycle, shitting on Nate Silver and 538, who are undoubtedly the best and most unbiased.  "
"358","1460956049","Hopefully I'm not the only one seeing this article as clickbait. The whole premise appears to be that 538 is trying to trick you. And his audience for clicks appears to be Sanders supporters who really want to believe he has a chance to win. Frankly, 538 is simply the most reliable source for real, fact-driven information out there. You can be like Karl Rove, and choose to ignore their data (as he did with Romney), or you can accept the facts and act accordingly."

"360","1460942149","The way some Bernie-ites have turned on FiveThirtyEight is so bizarre - 538 isn't some nefarious corporate media conglomerate. It's a fairly small Democratic-leaning website with a history of great polling/electoral analysis. But then they write an article on delegate math that involves facts and numbers and all of the sudden people are acting like they're a subsidiary of ExxonMobil."
"361","1460939032","Nope it's 1305-1099=206

edit: since fellow Berners downvoted me let me explain why there is difference

1) Nevada has not been fully flipped yet..although Bernie can flip 2 more delegates it's not certain

2) Nothing about Missouri is certain. Flipping delegates in primary is (almost) impossible

Of those 16 states, he's behind in recent polls in 11 of them -- the other 5 don't have any recent polling.

"375","1460996256","Clickbait. Every registered voter got a card that fully explains how they can participate in the primary. You can even complete it online. Anyone blocked from participating is doing so because of sheer laziness or ignorance on how the process works. "
"376","1460996375","NPA is a better term - no party affiliation. 

Years ago when I first went NPA, I told the person at the registration place I wasn't with any party. She said ""Oh, so you want the Independent Party?""

"377","1461000751","This is actually an old issue. The AIP has been around for a while, and the state really should put a big disclaimer on registration forms saying something like ""CHOOSE 'NO PARTY PREFERENCE' IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO REGISTER FOR A SPECIFIC PARTY"" in bold red letters..."

So they are entitled to a vote in the AIP primary, but not any other primary. It's funny because I guess people are too stupid to realize that there actually is an ""Independent"" party.

Anyway, there's still about a month left to register to vote in CA where you can change your party preference, so it's good that this is getting around now."

Society shift with the tides of change. I'm not one of those post-scarcity people but there is something to be said about technology and globalization making workers produce more for Less. Unless we have a giant plague that wipes out half the population that means people in three generations we are going to be making more stuff for less money then me now and there has to be a societal change to fix that.

To me Bernie Sanders and even to a greater extent Trump are a sign of the of political party realignment/splits. 

People like to act it's always been just Democrats and Republicans but there have been other parties in the United States that have grown and died and split off. I think it's possible the Republicans will split and the Democrats will have to readjust their policies back to what they were in the new Left era of the 60's and 70's

I mean I remember my dad used to make fun of ""Clinton Democrats"" for just being blue Republicans. The new Dems were considered much more conservative than the Democrats of 20 years prior and people need to remember that."

"401","1461000181","I love capitalism but capitalism needs proper regulation to balance the needs of suppliers and consumers. I believe that a competitive market will naturally yield the best results for the public. However many of our markets are becoming oligopolies instead of competitive markets which allow the few controlling corporations to game the system.

This is true for product markets as well as job markets. This is why corporations' profits are the largest they have ever been while wages are stagnant. This trend towards oligopolies is due to escalating deregulation and the increasing trend towards vertical and horizontal integration that the government has begun encouraging instead of regulating. This is due to the prevalence of corporate money in politics. Bernie is the only candidate that seems willing to tackle these corporations"

PSA: Affordable Housing != Public Housing

Politicians have been conflating the two. That's not good for people who live in public housing.

___

Sanders public housing plan is a single line tucked into his much longer [Affordable Housing Plan](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-for-affordable-housing/), which is linked from OP's press release:

&gt; **Repair Public Housing.** We need sufficient funding for public housing operating and capital costs, and we need to reduce the unacceptable backlog of public housing capital needs.

[That's it](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-for-affordable-housing/).

Lawrence O'donnell has been talking about it all week, and he's right. **Neither of these Democratic candidates** have put forward good enough plans to help address the $17B in repairs needed for NYCHA residents... *who outnumber the entire population of Vermont...* And that's just public housing residents in New York City alone.

Both candidates talk a big game on affordable housing, but it's *not the same* as public housing. Affordable housing is a middle class issue. Public housing is different and should get specific, national visibility.

It's disgraceful how nobody is actually putting forward substantive policies that address the most basic housing needs of people who live in public housing.

I suppose the element of partial ownership would also empower residents and also smaller agencies and charities that help develop the buildings on top of the leased land. They'd be able to conduct their matters in a rational way.

Still, if we want affordable housing, we also need a lot more market rate housing. A lot more. At this point each large American city could be measured by how many housing units are delivered per year minus how many people need one.  Even luxury condo skyscrapers still serve a purpose if they act like a huge sink for excess money and demand that would gentrify and ruin outlying neighborhoods if wasn't being soaked up.

The federal government could actually help solve this problem, by tying funding given to projects to how responsible each recipient community is for the housing shortage. Places with ""growth management"" that's really just meant to exclude the plebs would find themselves under the gun."

"655","1461000633","&gt;In June 2009, the Haitian Parliament unanimously passed a law requiring that the minimum wage be raised to $0.61 an hour, or $5 a day. (The average cost of living is estimated to be the equivalent of about $23 a day.) This pay raise was staunchly opposed by foreign manufacturers who had set up shop in the country, and the United States Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development backed those manufacturers.  After Haiti's government mandated the raise, the United States aggressively (and successfully) pushed Haiti's president to lower the minimum wage for garment workers to what factory owners were willing to pay: the equivalent of about $0.31 an hour (or $2.50 per eight-hour day).

"658","1460982909","The context is that the US is trying to help Haiti develop after mismanaging it in the past.

&gt;Since 2001, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates gave as much as $40 million to the Clinton Foundation. In contrast, six similar non-governmental global charities collected no money from those same four Middle Eastern countries; the International Committee of the Red Cross was given $6.82 million.

For example, I live in a city in the Midwest where $15 would be far more than a living wage; shouldn't the minimum wage be decided on a state-to-state basis?

"801","1460932191","The one major ignorance about Bernie's $15 dollar minimum wage is to failure to understand about cost of living costs in different communities and employer's ability to maintain that wage in a particular locality. $15 an hour minimum wage in a high-cost area where people have lots of disposible income is absolutely necessary just to get by without living on a stream.  However, in an area of rural Texas or Nebraska, the area just does not have enough high-paying jobs to sustain the increase in prices that it would take the business to cover the wage.  In addition, the living costs could be way cheaper allowing a person to survive on a lower wage than in Los Angeles or Seattle.  

The federal government pays its workers based on locality.  The most expensive areas have the highest wages while areas with lower wages have lower of cost of living.  Aka: that is minimum wage should be.  I think Hillary being a former cabinet member understand this very well.  Most of Bernie Sanders followers probably never worked the federal government and therefore, do not understand when Hillary makes reference to a $12 minimum for some areas and $15 dollars for other areas.

"810","1460998188","As a Mormon myself, I will say that I understand why Trump is not popular in Utah.  He clashes with Mormon culture/lifestyle/religion.  If I were to admit I like Trump, I would likely be judged or questioned, ""Wow, you like him.  Maybe GeneticsGuy isn't a very righteous person to consider someone like Trump, an unrepentant sinner, as a candidate.""  Seriously, I was chatting with some fellow brethren after church and I expressed my like of Trump and it was like awkwardness all around. Good thing I am well-liked and know how to lead a conversation to make it less-awkward, but ya, it is a social minefield among Mormons to admit Trump support right now.

A large part of it has to do with a perceived anti-Hispanic aura about Trump, even though it's not really true.  The media has done a good job of pushing this ""Trump is racist"" thing, or the idea of the wall and such, and while Mormons are very conservative on social issues, for the most part, there are some anomalies, like with immigration.  Mormons are more lenient on immigration than the mainstream conservatives on the right.  Not just immigration though, but in the latin world as a whole.

Mexico has the 2nd largest population of Mormons outside of the US, and the vast majority of Mormons living outside of the US are in Mexico, Central and South America.  Utah has the higher % per capita of white people that speak Spanish (and Portuguese) fluently.  Why?  Many Mormons serve 2 year missions, and something like 60-70% of Mormon missionaries live in Latin-American nations and often develop a bit of a soft-spot for it.  So, painting Trump as anti-Hispanic (even though I believe he is not), has been largely a success by the media, and it shows harshly in a place like Utah.

There's many other reasons I won't go into, but he clashes, let's leave it at that.

Now, here is why these hypotheticals are stupid though and Utah is never going to vote for someone like Hillary or Bernie.  Abortion issues and gun control.  Right now, Trump is in the media and making a lot of noise.  The anti-Democrat media that will surely hit Utah in a general election only needs to touch on those 2 things and Utah will be right back in line.  The only difference is that instead of voting 80% Republican this year and 20% Democrat, they might vote 65-70% Republican this year instead.  It won't even be close, just like usual.

Bring up liberal ideologies of Bernie and Hillary and boom, they are going to drop like a rock.  This is why I say, even though these hypothetical polls are out there, they are just not going to be accurate at all.

These primary matchup hypotheticals rarely reflect how things are in the general election once it is finally down to 2 candidates."

While it does say some of the same stuff that we have been hearing for a little while. But it does bring up a few interesting points. One of them here.

&gt;It’s critical not to confuse “independents” with “moderates.” Sanders’s career itself underscores that point: He long called himself an independent, even while compiling a very liberal voting record. Sanders has demonstrated a real outsider appeal that does better among people with a similar profile, people who lean left but are wary of calling themselves Democrats. But appealing to people who are especially disaffected politically is a double-edged sword: It wins votes disproportionately among people less likely to be registered as Democrats, putting Sanders at a disadvantage in closed primaries such as New York’s and Pennsylvania’s. We should also avoid reading too much into Sanders’s support among independent leaners in terms of how he’d fare in November: The independents who vote in party primaries are in no way representative of independents generally."

"852","1460981674","So. Let's get a few things straight here starting with some history.  GE used PCBs during manufacturing of various components at its plant in Fort Edward. They had a permit to dump in the river. They vastly exceeded the amount they were allowed to dump heavily polluting the area near Fort Edward. 

PCBs will flow a bit in water (they look like an inkblot with a little oily sheen), but they are heavy and have a tendency to sink into soils leaching out a little at a time over. When the USACE blew up the earthen dam near the plant, rather than help anything, it spread the pollution down river for miles. While this diluted the pollution in any particular area, it also increased the cost of the cleanup substantially.  

Now, for the last decade GE has been paying to cleanup the pollution as mandated by the EPA under CERCLA. While GE and the EPA are still fighting in court over how much cleanup is required, in either groups opinions the cleanup is actually nearing its end. The majority of the remaining debate is more about the depth of the shipping channel and less about remaining pollution. 

Now on to what Bernie said.  GE will never pay to clean the river South of the Mohawk and frankly they shouldn't be forced to. There is so much other pollution flowing into the Hudson from the Mohawk (from Alcoa for example) there is no way to prove what was put there by GE. I know they have deep pockets and it would be nice to make them pay to clean this up instead of having it fall on taxpayers, but there is no legal recourse allowing for that to happen. Realistically, if people want to eat fish from the Hudson again, they are going to have to pay the taxes to fund a cleanup. 

America as a whole needs to start realizing that there was a price to the industrial revolution and that the bill is coming due in places like the Hudson valley. Or we can live with the current cancer cluster and avoid any fish from the river.

* The 50 companies spent $2.6 billion to influence the federal government, while reaping nearly $11.2 trillion in federal support, for an effective return of 400,000 percent on their lobbying expenses.
  
* US multinationals reported 43 percent of their foreign earnings from five tax havens, countries that accounted for only 4 percent of their foreign workforce and 7 percent of foreign investment. All told, US companies shifted between $500 billion and $700 billion in profits from countries where economic activity actually took place to countries where tax rates were low.

* In the year 2012 alone, US firms reported $80 billion in profits in Bermuda, more than their combined reported profits in the four largest economies (after the US itself): China, Japan, Germany and France. This figure was nearly 20 times the total GDP of the tiny island country.""

"965","1460918481","&gt; She issued an op-ed at CNN, on 21 January 2016, headlined, “Hillary Clinton: The cure for Citizens United is more democracy.” It opened:

&gt; Six years ago Thursday, the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United transformed our politics by allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections.

&gt; The effect was immediate. In the 2010 midterms, outside groups spent nearly 60% more than in 2006. In 2014, the top 100 donors spent nearly as much as all 4.75 million small donors combined. National networks of big-money donors funneled mountains of cash into targeted state races. By 2014, one party controlled both the governor’s mansion and the state legislature in 36 states — the most since the 1950s.

&gt; Restricting voting rights

&gt; Meanwhile, Republicans launched an aggressive campaign to restrict voting rights across the country. …

&gt; **As if that “aggressive campaign” were even relevant to the Citizens United decision? In the rest of her 700-word essay, she said virtually nothing more about that Supreme Court decision — a decision which enables and empowers her own corruption, as well as that of all other corrupt politicians. The only additional reference she made to it in her essay was: “Citizens United and its aftermath have twisted and perverted our democratic system.”** She’s seeking suckers’ votes.

Never have I known someone capable of saying so much while at the same time saying nothing at all."
"966","1460939057","This is ridiculous.  Of course she's against Citizens United.  She has been on record against it and always has supported campaign finance reform.  She voted for the big campaign finance reform bill ""McCain Feingold"" in the Senate.  Where is the evidence here?"

"972","1460962440","To all of the commenters saying HRC clearly supports this you are definitely right. The problem I have with HRC is that this doesn't seem to be a very important issue to her considering she virtually never talks about it, unless prompted to speak about it.

While Hillary was Secretary of State, the president of DRoC was coming close to the end of his last term, and had lot and lots of assets that he didn't want to have made public. To help with this, he made this ridiculously huge offer for Bill to speak there, with hopes that the money would curry favor with Hillary. They (Bill and Hillary) had to ask the state department if this was acceptable. **They wanted to take the money but the state department said no.**

We are hearing about this now for two reasons: 1. They found out about the request because of the freedom of information act releasing Hillary's emails from her time as SoS. 2.

...


&gt; Some voters are shunted into districts where their party’s candidate has no chance of winning,**a process known as “cracking.”** Others are crammed into districts that so overwhelmingly favor their party’s candidate that casting an additional ballot for that candidate merely adds padding to a foregone conclusion, **a process known as “packing.”** “A gerrymander,” Stephanopoulos and McGhee write, “is simply a district plan that results in one party wasting many more votes than its adversary.”

The fact that there's a whole vocabulary for the ways gerrymandering discriminates against identifiable groups of voters, wouldn't you say we've crossed the line here, and this is clearly unconstitutional?"

&gt; The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw &amp; Company Research (R).  The poll was conducted by telephone with live interviewers April 11-13, 2016 among a random national sample of 1,021 registered voters (RV).  Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 

&gt; Landline (489) and cellphone (532) telephone numbers were randomly selected for inclusion in the survey using a probability proportionate to size method, which means phone numbers for each state are proportional to the number of voters in each state.  Fieldwork conducted by Braun Research, Inc. of Princeton, NJ.

This part really sticks out with respect to the point the article is trying to make:

&gt; Rolling poll data from Reuters shows that **the Vermont senator does especially well with white young women, with 61 percent young female voters supporting him, a sharp contrast to Clinton’s 28 percent support** within the same demographic."

He’s the man with a vision
to better this country.
Running for president 
but the rich don’t want him.
Bernie Sanders is his name.
Now you're going to feel his burn.

New York is the state where he was born.
Brooklyn where he grew up.
As kid he started noticing 
the rich getting richer
and the poor working longer hours.
Still many don't make enough to survive.

He's the son of Immigrants 
who came in search of better lives.
Working to succeed
like we all do every day.
We come here with the same dream:
Provide our families a better chance at life.

The rich and the media don't like him
and they’re scared that he can win.
He wants college to be free
so our children can progress.
He believes health care is for all.
Not a business, but a human right.

Years ago, in Chicago, he was arrested 
for protesting against segregation.
He doesn’t care about the color of your skin
to him we are all children of God.
Many call him Robin Hood
others call him The Bern.

Fighting for the rights of the people
even law enforcement could not stop him.
He'll keep battling until he becomes 
president of this nation.
Bernie Sanders is his name.
This is his corrido The Bern!"

Before I got to talk to my 49 yo mother about Bernie Sanders she had already heard about ""the old man"" and that he may be ""better than Hillary"". So it seems his recognition has risen. But make no mistake , many if most Latinos are okay with Hillary. 

While r politics loves Rosario Dawson taking jabs at Clinton and backing Sanders it should be noted Hillary has the support of a TON of Latino leaders like Eva Longoria, Ricky Martin, Salma Hayek. These are all people that have been advocating for the rights of Latinos for at least a decade now and certainly have more political scars and reach than Rosario Dawson. 

So it's not over until it's over. Bernie  can win California, but a lot has to happen before he gets here.

"1308","1460893255","Populism and anti-establishment feeling has sprung up across the world. 

See success of the Five Star movement in Italy, the election of Syriza in Greece and to a lesser extent the resurgence of the Front National in France and the presence of UKIP in the UK.

At some stage in the last half a decade the trust that people have in both politicians and the political process has dropped off a cliff. 

Now, in continental Europe, proportional voting systems mean that dissatisfaction is very easy to express and alternative parties can spring up, and get a foothold, in a matter of years or even months.

In the US things are different.

The first past the post voting system means that change is both difficult and slow. The quickest way to effect change is from within the existing party structure of the dominant parties the Republicans and the Democrats.

In the case of the Democrats Sanders had a slow start but has gained quickly as he established himself and his platform as an alternative candidate. His lack of name-recognition meant that he was always going to start on the back-foot against the well-known Hillary Clinton. It makes sense that he has picked up as time has gone-on but it looks like it may well be too late. 

The Republicans situation is almost the opposite. The insurgent candidate is immensely well known and has been for decades. This meant that he started on the front-foot. Trump has also benefited from a very split field. While the majority of votes cast have been for non-Trump candidates he was polling higher than any other perspective nominee. And in the winner-takes all states it meant that he mopped up.

We should also bear in mind that this is not the general election. The people voting in Primaries are self-selecting and represent a tiny-fraction of the electorate. And both the insurgent Republican and Democratic candidates are immensely unpopular with huge swathes of voters who identify as the opposite Party. 

Come the general it could be that the prevailing forces of conservatism favour an establishment candidate. 

Populism is a double-edged sword in this race. It can win you the nomination but lose you the general election. "

We are creatures of habits and we have recorded this throughout history. "
"1319","1460922547","Gather round children and I'll tell you a tale, about how our political system came to be...

When designing our electoral system the founders instituted a simple first-past-the-post system that had been the standard in most western democracies since the Athenians. Parties emerged, and every generation or so one party would get too out of touch and a new party would replace them. The Democrat-Republicans replaced the Federalists, the Democrats and the Whigs replaced the Democrat-Republicans (truly beginning the two party system) and the Whigs were replaced by the Republicans. Then in 1912 Theodore Roosevelt tried to do this again by running under the Bull Moose Progressive Party, but something different happened this time. Rather than grow into their own party, the progressive Republicans who joined TR in 1912 jumped ship for the Democrats. Both parties were now much more powerful than their predecessors had been, thanks to the increased cost of running a national campaign, and it became harder to simply unseat one with a newer agenda. Another interesting change began at the turn of the 20th century: Political Primaries started to be adopted. Only about a dozen states ever used them to assign delegates, and both parties still preferred to nominate at a national convention, but the progressive era was beginning to lay the groundwork for a more involved body politic than in previous generations, and a greater scrutiny towards political elites/party bosses. Successive elections like 1924, 1948 and 1960 would see progressives leave the Republican party and racists leave the Democratic party, leaving the Democrats with smaller conservative wings and Republicans with smaller Liberal wings.

Then came 1968, [the last election until 2008 that would see voter turnout break 60%](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voter_turnout.png) and in that election we saw a paradigm shift in political culture. This would be the election that purged the last elements of the ""Dixiecrats"" (racist southern Democrats) from the Democratic party and set the stage for the rise of national primaries. For the Republicans, the primary contest was a close race between Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon (Reagan narrowly won the primary contest), but Nixon won the national convention handily... for the Democrats it was a very different story. Hubert Humphrey, as Johnson's VP, had to run in support of the Vietnam war, with college students and African American democrats hated, and they voted in the primaries overwhelmingly in opposition to Humphrey. 69% of primary voters voted for either Bobby Kennedy or Gene McCarthy, and most Kennedy supporters believed McCarthy would be their guy after Kennedy was assassinated. With only 2.21% of primary voters supporting him, McCarthy still received the Democratic party nomination. The result was a close race in terms of the popular vote, but one where Richard Nixon swept 32 states and 301 electoral votes. The Democrats blamed their loss on Humphrey (and the party nominating system) failing to engage minorities, women, and the youth. So in 1969 the McGovern–Fraser Commission adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for the aforementioned voters, leading to most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections.

And this is where things start to fall apart. The primary process (also adopted by the Republicans, much for the same reasons outlined in the McGovern–Fraser Commission) resulted in the parties seeking ideological purity over electability and a desire to govern. At first the system was just chaotic, with no clear consensus candidates between 1972 and 1980 for the Democrats, and primary challengers for both parties in 1976 and 1980. Ronald Reagan was really the first candidate to use the primary process to his advantage by building a coalition from within his party rather than the traditional process of parties building coalitions among demographic interests. And there's the problem: primary voters are party loyalists often more interested in ideological purity than electability or the ability to govern. And if all you have to do to win the election is appeal to the party ideology, guess what? The more moderate members will start to leave and not vote in the general. This is what led to the low turnouts of the late 20th Century and early 2000s. Also, primaries made elections longer and more expensive, not just for Presidential campaigns, but for House and Senate elections as well. Politicians had to simultaneously appeal to the worst elements within their party and interest groups who now could directly influence politicians rather than negotiate with party leaders. So parties got more radical and voters less interested. Things changed under the Bush administration as the country's disgust with his policies led to the Democratic ""Big Tent"" (that pushed the party more to the middle), but the radicalization in the primary process continued (it just got a reprieve in the Democratic party), and that's how we wound up with the current crop of Republican nut bags, and one very liberal independent and one center-left (by American Standards) Democratic candidates.

TL/DR: Primaries suck."

Take a look at the most recent revolutions occurring across the world. They have more often than not created massive instability for in some cases decades. More often than not, they lead to further central authority, less freedom and a situation that was much worse than it was before.

You all rant and rave about corporations supposedly stripping you of your rights, yet you do not even take a moment to think about what your movement would create. Undoubtedly, it would lead to handing political power to the hands of a few. You would be trading what is in reality minimal corporate overreach for something remarkably worse. History has proven this to be the case time and time again.

This Fox TV thing is a *very*  pro-Sanders article - so why does the Reddit Headline above intentionally miss that?

Is Sanders so upset with that statement?  That he has to hide it on Reddit? Then he's **really** not going to like this one, is he:

&gt;What Clooney pointed to is that Clinton has been bringing in millions of dollars, not just for her campaign, but also for Democrats running in House, Senate and other local races.

&gt;""It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress,"" Clooney said on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday. ""And the reason that's important, and the reason it's important to me, is because we need — I'm a Democrat. So if you're a Republican, you're going to disagree, but we need to take the Senate back.""

http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474585666/george-clooney-on-a-big-money-difference-between-clinton-and-sanders

The the headline above manages to miss the first major point **even though it is central to Bernies campaign!**

Why?  Why throw the major point out?  Huh? Possibly because no one would pay attention if the actual (Fox) headline was used?

But since it mentions this indirectly, it is time that we look at it.  The problem is two fold.

1.  Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will be carpet bombed by Adelson, Pope, the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Bush Rangers. Ad Sanders is not equipped to deal with that. And rejecting the strongest statement Clooney made about it just makes Sanders  worse off. 

2.  What Clooney ALSO Said: Democrat Congressional campaigns also need money  and Bernie Sanders has no clue how to handle this. 

The entire attempt to get rid of Citizens United requires a team. Otherwise it would  end in a fiasco if there is no money for Congressional campaigns and apparently Bernie Sanders has no plans.
"
"1459","1460944622","That *obscene* amount of money is mainly going to the downballot to turn the Senate blue and hopefully (over the next two elections) the House. Sanders has not raised a nickle to help Democrats running in November. Which is astonishing."

Could we possibly consider what the article actually is instead of pretending that this is something written by George Clooney and that its accurate.  

It is neither.   There is much truth to what he says but that is only PARTLY considered by the headline and since people ""Vote up"" these headlines without every discussing the or finding out that they aren't complete, they become lies created for the benefit of Fox News or some other source where A) it gets to USE Reddit to post its headlines for free or B) someone USES the people in the article for their own purpose.

Also, if it's known that KSA is determined to sell these assets then buyers will likely try to negotiate discounted pricing. In the end, it doesn't hurt the US. Even if the entire $750 billion were US treasuries I hate to break it to them but that would hardly make a dent in the yearly churn in that market (almost 6 trillion a year).

Oh, they want to fight over oil? How about the US borrows 500 billion to pay for a tax credit to keep shale oil in play for 5 decades until KSA is overrun by riots in the streets. How about that?

"1558","1460921944","One of the primary issues with this topic is that anyone who even thinks to question the narrative of climate change becomes labeled as a ""climate denier"". Many folks here seem to be under the delusion that someone who is a climate denier is denying that the Earth goes through climate shifts. That is not the case at all. 

I myself am what most of you would call a ""climate denier"", but not because I don't believe in the effects of climate change. Quite the contrary. I live in Alaska. I have seen first hand the effects of climate change. When I was growing up we never used to have thunder storms in the summer, and now we get them every year. In my life time I have seen the reduction of one of our glaciers. The question with all of this change is not whether or not it is happening, buy WHY it is happening. I question the narrative that humans are causing climate change because in all the research presented, and in all the documentation I have seen, I have never seen anyone substantially account for the fact that we are living next to a giant ball of plasma that has its own shifts in climate over time. We have seen the history of the Earth in the rock sediment. We have an accurate history of the Earth going through heating and cooling cycles long before humans ever even arrived on the scene, let alone began using fossil fuels.

Denying someone their first amendment rights because they dare to say that humans are not the cause of climate change, and that the Sun is the likely culprit, is no different than when Galileo was put under house arrest for daring to suggest that humanity was not the center of the Universe and that the Earth might actually orbit the Sun. 

But of course I will likely receive several comments along the lines of ""he has fewer brain cells, so his opinions are invalid"", or ""don't listen to him, he doesn't believe in science"". If daring to have an opinion in 2016 is considered an act warranting damnation, then perhaps we have come full circle back to when the church was dictating every facet of reality. People who questioned the church hundreds of years ago were called ""blasphemers"", now it seems we are called ""deniers"", and to much the same effects. "

"1594","1460929638","&gt;The problem with this new wrinkle in Hillary Clinton's K-12 education agenda is the assertion that the federal government is to blame for over-testing. Nothing could be further from the truth. __On average, federal policies account for seven hours of testing per year – roughly 0.6 percent of an average school year.__ The time students spend on assessments required by states and school districts is, on average, two to three times that required by the federal government.

This seems very reasonable. The federal government should prevent state governments from enacting their own standardized testing."
"1595","1460955145","Pre statement: I like Bernie Sanders and do not trust/respect Hillary for a vast majority of her views and actions. I am a high school math/science teacher at an alternative High School.

That being said, I agree with Hillary on this issue - state testing in its current iteration needs to end. Although the federal requirement only asks for 7 hours of testing a year, those seven hours ripple out into the rest of the school year and warp the education of my students.

I hate those tests.

I could elaborate on any of the following points, but I want to clearly explain why the testing requirements need to end.

1) The federal requirement has shifted the focus of education from learning many/deep ideas to testing well. This has impoverished our curriculum by focusing teachers on how to cover test material instead of the art of teaching. Do you remember the review day before a high school test -- it's like that for the whole year. Teaching on rails sucks.

2) Required testing creates more required testing. Because school districts have a financial incentive for their their kids to test well, they are driven to give the students more tests throughout the year to make sure they know if the kids will test well during the test that counts. Schools do not use the federally mandated tests to measure themselves -- that would be a lagging indicator. Instead, they use predictive tests several times a year to map out students' progress so they know they will be ready for the Big One.

3 &amp; 4) There are rarely accommodations for students who do not test well (test anxiety, better at once subject than another, life events outside school impacting their attentiveness, lower levels of Academic English because they speak another language at home, etc.). This leads students to believe they are stupid when they are simply different. Or, 4) they had a bad day.

Which leads to

5) This can be a barrier to graduation. Some students are not able to get their high school diploma because they did not meet the testing requirements for graduation. While this is only a few students, it is abominable to me that this happens at all. Some legislatures are making changes to ensure this does not happen, but the fact that it existed at all is morally wrong to me.

It is for these reasons and several more which are harder to quantify that I oppose high-stakes testing. It is one thing if we want to test our students to ""take their temperature"" so to speak. It is entirely a different sort of thing to ""measure their height"" and deem that some students are to ""short"" to be part of our society."
"1596","1460932818","""Apparently, the Clintons have parted ways with the vast majority of fellow Democrats, as well as civil rights and business groups, on the importance of annually measuring student progress against state academic benchmarks. Just last week, stumping on the campaign trail, former President Bill Clinton announced that Hillary Clinton ""thinks the federal government requires too many tests for U.S. schoolchildren.""

Unlike the phony debate about Common Core on the Republican side, this is an issue where the policies of the next president will actually matter. **And if Hillary Clinton acted to roll back what are already fairly minimal federal testing requirements, it would be to the detriment of our students, particularly poor and minority children, children of recent immigrants and students with disabilities.**

It's likely no coincidence that Bill Clinton made these comments in the lead-up to the Democratic primary in New York, where polls show the former secretary of state with a narrower lead than expected over rival and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. **The announcement also came on the eve of the first day of annual student testing in New York, where some largely well-to-do, suburban activists have been advocating that parents opt their children out of taking state assessments.**"""

"1684","1460911392","In terms of foreign policy, I think Hillary Clinton will be the best out there.   I will tell you why.  For years, I leaned somewhat towards the isolationist policy similar to that of Ron Paul, and perhaps Bernie Sanders too.  But from what I have seen in the last 8 years, I concluded that this isolationistic view was naive.  If the USA completely withdraws from intervention everywhere in the world, it will have a great impact on the US economy.  Gasoline will be $7/gallon.  Travel will be much more expensive.  Things will be much more costly.  I don't think Americans can deal with this.  But once you intervene, it's very hard not to be aggressive.  Look at Russia, China, Iran, etc.  Whenever they sense weakness from the US, they make a move.  China in Southeast Asia. Russia in the Middle East.  It's like football, if you don't watch, they gain a few yards.  So, the reality is you have to keep these guys in check.  What makes things complicated is that with China in particular, you also do business with them.  So, it requires a very sophisticated leader who is willing to participate in diplomacy as well as is prepared to be strong if necessary.  This is why I think Clinton is the great fit for this role at this time.  I don't think she's as hawkish as these guys portrayed her.  Don't forget she championed the ""reset"" with Russia.  It was successful for a while, when she was in office.  I think Clinton possesses a balanced understanding of diplomacy and military engagement that is better than anyone else in this race.

&gt;
&gt;Allow Government to Negotiate Drug Prices (79%)
&gt;
&gt;Give Students the Same Low Interest Rates as Big Banks (78%)
&gt;
&gt;Universal Pre-Kindergarten (77%)
&gt;
&gt;Fair Trade that Protects Workers, the Environment, and Jobs (75%)
&gt;
&gt;End Tax Loopholes for Corporations that Ship Jobs Overseas (74%)
&gt;
&gt;End Gerrymandering (73%)
&gt;
&gt;Let Homeowners Pay Down Mortgage With 401k (72%)
&gt;
&gt;Debt-Free College at All Public Universities (Message A) (71%)

This all equates to me one thing. Higher taxes. People need to pay higher taxes. Not just the rich, although they need to pay more proportionally. Americans today are selfish assholes who can't equate this fact. You've been thought to think that you can have this and still not pay higher taxes. You cannot. 

You need to ask yourself: What is more important to you? 35% tax rates or all these programs. That is really what it comes down to. 

Even Sanders is guilty of pulling this trick on you. Thinking that you can have it both. Although, granted, he's been mentioning it briefly at times. Hillary and the others have understood though. That you all actually want both. So they are forced to find a middle ground. Promising social programs and only manage to deliver some that is good enough for the general public. While doing tax breaks at the same time. That is a recipe for disaster. And you are to blame for it when you ask for both extended social programs and tax breaks. "

Why can't the money you are giving to a Global corporation to line the pockets of rich CEO's and executives be given to to people through the State, to better their living conditions through housing, medical care, food and so on?

Honestly in a lot of ways (this is speculation though so take it with a grain of salt) this is probably why we tried so hard to get this Nuclear Deal passed with Iran, to try and squeeze Saudi Arabia as much as we could after all these years. 

Edit: 

One thing I forgot to mention.. I'm not sure what the Imports look like for OTHER countries though.

Suppose they did decide to sell -- they have to sell at whatever levels the market is offering.  T-bill prices would drop like a rock, and yields would spike, and SA would realize huge losses by selling T-bills for far less than they'd bought them.  Meanwhile, other investors would be scrambling to buy T-bills at fire sale prices, likely dumping other asset classes to do so.

This is Uber being misleading (no surprise there).

When companies like Reddit, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and basically everyone else except Uber release a transparency report they are reporting on data that was requested by law enforcement or agencies involved in national security. In other words, subpoenas, warrants, and so on.

Uber received ~400 of those kind of requests for user data, and ~200 for driver data.

Uber's transparency report includes that, plus a bunch of other data they have to give to various government agencies that has nothing to do with crime or law enforcement or national security.

For instance, legal, licensed transportation companies in California are required to provide certain rider data to the California Public Utilities Commission so that the PUC can determine whether or not the company is serving all kinds of passengers in any neighborhood or are discriminating against minorities or disabled people and things like that. In other words the kind of stuff that PUC, as the body that regulates these companies in California, needs to actually regulate them.

As part of a deal with the PUC to not be shut down in California for operating an illegal, unlicensed taxi service Uber agreed to also provide this data. (And then they tried to renege on their agreement, were fined $7.6 million dollars, and then provided the data)."

Here is some info I posted before on some of the shadiness from the last Clinton presidency:

If they do go back, and I hope they don't, let's ensure they understand what is to stay in the house when they depart this time.

[""After they were criticized for taking $190,000 worth of china, flatware, rugs, televisions, sofas and other gifts with them when they left, the Clintons announced last week that they would pay for $86,000 worth of gifts, or nearly half the amount.""](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121856&amp;amp;page=1)

Also:
""Lawmakers are questioning Clinton’s desire to rent expensive office space in New York City at government expense. Because of the contention, the former president’s foundation has offered to pay at least $300,000 of an estimated $790,000 annual rent for the office Clinton favors.
**Mrs. Clinton, the new senator from New York, has faced questions about the propriety of accepting the gifts in the period between her election and her swearing-in.** Senate rules would have limited what she could accept had she been a senator.
Members of both parties also have criticized Clinton for granting scores of eleventh-hour clemency requests, including the pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive in Switzerland from 51 counts in the United States of tax evasion and fraud.""

Are you sure you want these people back in office? Seriously.

Edit: what do ya know, Marc Rich was a hedge fund manager. Check this out: 

""Marc Rich (born Marcell David Reich; December 18, 1934 – June 26, 2013) was an **international commodities trader, hedge fund manager, financier and businessman**. He was best known for founding the commodities company Glencore and for being indicted in the United States on **federal charges of tax evasion and illegally making oil deals with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis**. He was in Switzerland at the time of the indictment and never returned to the United States.  **He received a controversial presidential pardon from U.S. President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, Clinton's last day in office.**""

But do I think the speeches themselves contain a bunch of smoking gun gotchas? No way. I've been to events like this, and most likely if people did get their hands on the transcripts, they'd be bored out of their skulls reading them.

Even if there *is* such an arrangement, that's a back room deal, not something she is announcing to the rank and file employees of a big company. First of all, that's not how these things are done, and second, in case you hadn't noticed, Hillary pays a *lot* of attention to what information gets into whose hands (hence the private email servers).

Of course, I'm lying a bit here. I actually do understand the drive to get transcripts released.

The audience seems to get the joke. There was no doubt among Goldman Sachs and the other banks that provided speaking fees that would be deemed illegal had she announced her candidacy that Clinton was going to run for President in 2016. They openly flaunt the fact that they have found a way to skirt the spirit of a law enacted to prevent the corruption of candidates who are ""actively"" running for office.

Based on what people who saw these speeches have told the media, she has said things like ""hey, banks get a lot of hate, but I'm aware you aren't actually Satan - we need to all work together in order to get this economy moving.""

That kind of statement would hurt her among many liberals who, like Sanders, genuinely believe that the business of Wall Street is fraud.

Clooney: Yes.  I think it is an obscene amount of money.  I think, you know we had some protestors last night when we pulled up in San Francisco.  And they’re right to protest.  They’re absolutely right.  It is an obscene amount of money.  The Sander’s campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right.  It’s ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics.

Think about this while you're crying about these obviously rigged elections. The Clinton Foundation took 10's of millions from Saudi royals. Hillary Clinton turned around and sold them [$29bill in weapons as Secretary of State](http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187). The Saudis [murdered 24 children](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/22/families-were-blown-up-scenes-from-a-saudi-led-bombing-in-yemen/) last month with weapons sold to them through 'your' government. Nobody on Reddit gives a damn about this at all. They all keep chirping about delegate math and voting machines like this election was ever real to begin with.

How is it that there is no law that says politicians can't take money from people associated with countries that are clearly human rights abusers? How is it legal for Clinton to push through these weapons sales as Secretary of State after they gave their family foundation millions? How is there no accountability when the result is dead kids' bodies strewn out across a marketplace? Well look in the mirror cause you are the problem. You don't understand a damn thing and certainly don't give one shit about those people that were slaughtered. You sit on your fluffy ass and talk about delegate math and bs in the NY Times about voting machines.  In four years you'll get behind the next 'opposition' movement and fall for the same bullshit all over again. Maybe if you clowns didn't fall for this same thing every four years those kids would still be alive.  But sadly, you're all fake, good for nothing pieces of shit.

We need a member of congress to stand up for us and propose a law that says all leaders in the US are banned from taking money from people associated with human rights violating regimes. Period. If a leader takes money from a human rights violating regime and then sells them weapons then they will be charged with treason. Full stop.

I mean, what do you think the penalty is for treason in a place like North Korea or Saudi Arabia? Probably a lot worse than whatever that penalty is here. They'd get off easy no?

Several analysts have projected that this change would close Social Security's funding gap for at least 75 years.""

Wealthier citizens live longer than poor ones. In some parts of the US, wealthier citizens live on average 13 years longer than poor citizen.

In this article it claims that this would transform social security from an insurance program into a welfare program that explicitly transfers wealth from the rich to the poor.

Removing the contribution cap on social security while leaving the annual benefits cap in place is the only plausible measure to correct for the difference in years in which the wealthiest can expect to benefit from their insurance investment.

Every measure to ""improve"" social security that proposes raising the retirement age explicitly transfers wealth from poor to rich.

* Sanders doesn't talk too much about himself personally as do other candidates

&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke in unusually personal terms Saturday night about how his fight for the poor has been spurred by his own childhood, saying that there was “constant tension” between his parents over money.

* Father came from Poland and was satisfied with humble life he had as paint salesman. His mother was born and raised in the U.S. and had bigger dreams of wanting their own house. This would create tensions. 

&gt;That was a dream,” he said. “She died at the age of 46. She never achieved that dream.”

* Doesn't like shopping after his experience of having his mother take him to 15+ stores to find the cheapest leather jacket. 

* Hillary Clinton  did a fundraising in California that costed $33K per person. Before that, she listened to five black mothers whose children died to gun violence. 

&gt;“She took notes…Her staff didn’t take the notes. She took the notes. She followed up,” Ms. Carr (Mother of Eric Garner) said. “I do endorse her, but she endorsed us first.”

"2459","1460847653","I was there today (flew out from Los Angeles) and was among those arrested on the steps of the Capitol.  If you have questions let me know.  Most questions about the movement itself can be found at [democracyspring.org](http://www.democracyspring.org/) including [specific legislation](http://www.democracyspring.org/demands) proposed to combat the influence of big money interests in politics and voter suppression issues.

[Here's a photo](http://imgur.com/wxZ3Q9K) I took from the sit-in on the steps.  You can see the rally on the other side of the police line.  For the most part the Capitol city police were friendly.  I spent some time during processing talking to one of them about the Warriors for a while.

Here are a couple of short videos of the event: [one from the march](https://vid.me/vFFE) as we reached the Capitol and [one from the steps](https://vid.me/bjQA) right as we were about to begin the sit-in.

There was a 3 hour training session for those participating in the sit-in so many of us were well prepared and well informed.  Many people had participated in the arrests throughout the week and others had lots of experience in protests in years past.  The organization takes nonviolent direct action very seriously.  Members include Noam Chomsky and Lawrence Lessig as well as celebrities like Mark Ruffalo.

Those who chose to sit-in on the steps of the Capitol in violation of the law and be arrested were also fined $50, resulting in $45,000+ in fines.  Some people did go to jail and others were processed on-site (see details in comments below).  Those who chose not to sit-in (the majority) protested in the ""designated"" protest area.

The protests earlier in the week had coverage by better news organizations:

Possibly also push for wider support and access for young people going into trades in lieu of college and help make it easier to find apprenticeship programs across the board. 

The country badly needs an actual left-wing party to combat the centrist Democrats and Right-Wing Republicans. Start with focus on local elections, city councils, state legislatures, mayoral races and then hopefully move up from there. I imagine a Party like this could easily form an alliance with the Green Party and some of the more liberal members of the Libertarian Party, too. But focusing on local elections before full state or federal races could potentially build a base over time. And if the two-party system dies out, it would be great to have an actual progressive left party to push for in countrywide elections.

This election cycle has been completely focused on domestic issues. Personally, I'm ok with Hillary's approach to some of these issues. I like Bernie's approach to several of these as well. However, with foreign policy considered, I just can't vote for Clinton. Even in the last debate, she made a point that she recommended that Obama arm Syrians to fight the regime there.

For starters if you write in Bernie it just won't be counted at all.  I can understand trying to send a message to the DNC, but if Hillary does win with more votes and pledged delegates, what message is that supposed to be exactly?  That the wishes of the majority are not what matter?  That doesn't sound like a very good message to me.

On the other hand, voting third party does sound possible, but has protest votes ever really worked at any time in the past?  It surely didn't work in 2000, and it didn't do any good for the reform party.  Secondly, and this is the big thing, there is a lot at stake this election.  Millions of more people have access to healthcare through insurance now, and the two most likely candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, want to undo the act that gave those people that healthcare.  If you don't have a lot to lose by having a republican as the next president, it may not sound like a bad idea to take a protest vote, but for a lot of people, they have their healthcare/health insurance on the line.  I can't in good conscious vote for someone who does not have a chance to win in the general election, when my vote could be going to someone who does actually have a chance to win.

This election cycle has been completely focused on domestic issues. Personally, I'm ok with Hillary's approach to some of these issues. I like Bernie's approach to several of these as well. However, with foreign policy considered, I just can't vote for Clinton. Even in the last debate, she made a point that she recommended that Obama arm Syrians to fight the regime there.

"2681","1460834177","I really have a lot of issues with the Bernie or bust movement, despite liking Bernie himself.

I understand a lot of people have invested a lot of time and energy into his campaign, but if he wins, it seems counter productive to either write in or vote Green.  For starters if you write in Bernie it just won't be counted at all.  I can understand trying to send a message to the DNC, but if Hillary does win with more votes and pledged delegates, what message is that supposed to be exactly?  That the wishes of the majority are not what matter?  That doesn't sound like a very good message to me.

On the other hand, voting third party does sound possible, but has protest votes ever really worked at any time in the past?  It surely didn't work in 2000, and it didn't do any good for the reform party.  Secondly, and this is the big thing, there is a lot at stake this election.  Millions of more people have access to healthcare through insurance now, and the two most likely candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, want to undo the act that gave those people that healthcare.  If you don't have a lot to lose by having a republican as the next president, it may not sound like a bad idea to take a protest vote, but for a lot of people, they have their healthcare/health insurance on the line.  I can't in good conscious vote for someone who does not have a chance to win in the general election, when my vote could be going to someone who does actually have a chance to win.  I don't even need to mention supreme court justices (we are very close to having the first majority progressive court in a long while).

"2695","1460837945","This post has got it all. A trump or Cruz presidency will make the country more liberal? Amazing. Bernie or Bust just shows that you don't know what you want and have no real plan to get there.

Let me tell yeah, if you wanted real progressive change than this is the exact opposite way to do it. And I mean the presidency. See despite what will inevitably get linked, /r/GrassrootsSelect is not enough as it currently stands. If you want an end to the war on drugs you'd vote for judges, sheriffs, and DA's who end them in your state and community and who could lobby your state government to do that. If you wanted free healthcare and college, an end to private prisons, stricter gun regulations, an end to faith based teachings in schools, protections towards minorities and women, and other progressive goals then you'd vote for State senators, representatives, attorneys generals, governors, town councilmen, mayors, school board members, and many other positions to enact political change. But you don't. Bernie or Bust folks have little patience for the tedium of state and local politics. 

You and your fellow compatriots really don't care about progressivism or liberalism because if you did you'd recognize what it takes to get that change done. You'd vote for a libertarian, or trump, or a tea partier just to give a finger to Clinton. This just shows that you are politically immature and these asinine ramblings will be over once June 7th rolls around. See Clinton supporters said the same thing back in 2008. And look how that turned out.

You can't post anything, even if it is a quality news source from a reputable journalist, if it says anything positive about Republicans, Clinton, the DNC, or anything that isn't praising Sanders. Instead, you can post a bunch of garbage from Huffpost, Vox, Salon, and lately even the National Enquirer if it fits one of the above mentioned categories. This subreddit really shouldn't complain about bias because they are arguably more guilty than any news source of bias. CNN or Fox or MSNBC. Yeah you can say that each have their biases, but they at least let their opponents talk from time to time.

Don't take inspiration from Trudeau. The only reason he looks good is because the guy before him was Canada's Bush.

I should add, a much more apt contemporary example is [Jeremy Corbyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn), the uncompromising leader of the UK Labour Party.

"2746","1460837945","This post has got it all. A trump or Cruz presidency will make the country more liberal? Amazing. Bernie or Bust just shows that you don't know what you want and have no real plan to get there.

Let me tell yeah, if you wanted real progressive change than this is the exact opposite way to do it. And I mean the presidency. See despite what will inevitably get linked, /r/GrassrootsSelect is not enough as it currently stands. If you want an end to the war on drugs you'd vote for judges, sheriffs, and DA's who end them in your state and community and who could lobby your state government to do that. If you wanted free healthcare and college, an end to private prisons, stricter gun regulations, an end to faith based teachings in schools, protections towards minorities and women, and other progressive goals then you'd vote for State senators, representatives, attorneys generals, governors, town councilmen, mayors, school board members, and many other positions to enact political change. But you don't. Bernie or Bust folks have little patience for the tedium of state and local politics. 

You and your fellow compatriots really don't care about progressivism or liberalism because if you did you'd recognize what it takes to get that change done. You'd vote for a libertarian, or trump, or a tea partier just to give a finger to Clinton. This just shows that you are politically immature and these asinine ramblings will be over once June 7th rolls around. See Clinton supporters said the same thing back in 2008. And look how that turned out.

My real question is, I wonder who the hip young people choice will be in 2024?"

"2748","1460858385","I like how a complaint thread about bias has been upvoted in a subreddit in which bias is the name of the game. r/politics has become a mouthpiece for the Sanders campaign in every way. You can't post anything, even if it is a quality news source from a reputable journalist, if it says anything positive about Republicans, Clinton, the DNC, or anything that isn't praising Sanders. Instead, you can post a bunch of garbage from Huffpost, Vox, Salon, and lately even the National Enquirer if it fits one of the above mentioned categories. This subreddit really shouldn't complain about bias because they are arguably more guilty than any news source of bias. CNN or Fox or MSNBC. Yeah you can say that each have their biases, but they at least let their opponents talk from time to time. Here anyone who isn't totally pro-Bernie or has some doubts about him just gets downvoted into oblivion because these enlightened and unbiased redditors can't have room for anyone who isn't already in their circle jerk.

"2754","1460854416","&gt;Seeing what Justin Trudeau is doing in Canada has been impressive. 

For the record, Trudeau is *not* analogous to Sanders. Trudeau is basically Obama - looks good, speaks well, pulls the pro-corporate/[neocon warmonger behind the scenes](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-saudi-arms-deal-amnesty-report-1.3535760). Trudeau is more like a Democrat than Bernie is (runs left, rules center-right and knows where his bread is buttered - a sellout with a haircut).

Don't take inspiration from Trudeau. The only reason he looks good is because the guy before him was Canada's Bush.

----

I should add, a much more apt contemporary example is [Jeremy Corbyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn), the uncompromising leader of the UK Labour Party.

For the closest historical analog to Bernie in Canada it would certainly be [Tommy Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Douglas) - father of our national healthcare system."

She's said that she'd want to eliminate the death penalty from the states, and only reserve it for the most heinous documented terrorists, like the ISIS executioners and The Unabomber. 

3) ""She's not for the decriminalization of marijuana""

She supports re-scheduling, and the federal legalization of medical marijuana. She's said that she supports states' rights to legalize recreational use, like in Colorado and Washington, and that she believes they're setting a good example of how it can work.

4) She's not for a $15 minimum wage

She supports a federal minimum wage of 12 dollars per hour, and wants cities like NYC and Los Angeles to raise it to 15, where the cost of living is higher. 


5) She's for limiting certain types of abortions

She's only in favor of late-term abortion in cases of rape, incest and risk to a woman's health. This is an opinion shared by *most* people who are pro-choice.

So she's beating him by 9 points in *pledged* delegates. There are 1651 pledged delegates yet to be awarded. 2026 is a majority of pledged delegates. So Sanders needs 931/1651=56.4% of remaining delegates to have a majority of pledged delegates, which is almost certainly a prerequisite for super delegates switching to his side giving him an outright majority and the nomination.

So he needs to win the remaining races by an average of almost thirteen percentage points when up to this point in the race he has been loosing by an average of about 9 points.

&gt; ""I deny that. It was not that way,"" Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo told Reuters in a telephone interview while he was traveling in New York. Sorondo, a close aide to Pope Francis, is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is hosting the event.

"2986","1460818166","I've commented similar things in a couple threads already, but I feel like this is a message worth spreading. 

We all have a choice, reacting to this news. We could take partisan sides, argue about the details of the trip or discuss whether it was a political ploy. Or we could talk about compassion, discuss how to work together, possibly even make amends across candidate preferences and party lines. 

When someone like the Pope tries to spread peace and compassion throughout the world he gives us an opportunity to follow his lead. He gives us a chance to look away from politics and to look inside ourselves to see what is truly good there. He gives us a chance to rise above heated policy discussions and recognize that in the end we're all in this together. 

Whether or not we agree on policy is one thing, but the more important question is whether we agree on a common goal. Do we agree that we're all in this together, that we're all living on the same Earth, that we're all intrinsically connected? Do we agree that the way to govern is to choose what is right for all of us, not just the few? Do we agree that ethics has a place in politics? Do we agree that people should have shelter and security and that we should work to provide it for the weak and infirm? Do we agree that we should work to benefit the community and not ourselves?

These are important questions that too often get lost in the intricacies of politics. I hope we all agree on the answers, but that's not the point. Just being reminded that the questions exist is enough to change the way we act. Working as individuals isn't how we improve society, but working together is. Reminding ourselves that we have a shared responsibility to take care of each other and the planet is beyond any parties or candidates, it's intrinsic to human life itself. Again -- we're all in this together. You and me, I and them, them and you. We're all one.

*""The most insidious thing about trickle-down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer, it's good for the economy. It's the claim that if the poor get richer, that it will be bad for the economy.""* - Nick Hanauer"
"3014","1460995649","The ""good ideas""

1. Violates the core accounting principle, the matching principle

2. Is fine, but you have to realize the dependent tax credit is not just about children. By removing this tax credit you will disproportionately affect multigenerational homes with retired grandparents, parents and grandchildren, most of which are low income house holds

3. Is a good idea till you see how underfunded those programs are to begin with. I am fine with cutting ss and Medicare from the poor, that being said working elderly should certainly still pay ss and Medicare. Just because they have paid their whole lives doesn't mean they get to just stop. The article claims this will help keep elderly people in the work force.. This is already happening since pension plans are all but non existant and it's hurting unemployment among younger people with less experience.

Now for the ""bad ideas""

1. Honestly I am not gonna argue this one because there are so many factors at play you really can't determine how it will impact the economy as a whole since that money will get reinvested. Really who knows until you try. But those tax rates are fairly consistent with tax rates from the Reagan years and the economy was doing pretty well then. 

2. This one pisses me off. First of all the article dismisses it as not a tax on Wall Street, then literally argues that is benefits those that ""turn companies around"" aka hedge fund managers. That being said their example 

&gt;
For example, say five people come together to save a failing company; four provide the money, and the fifth manages the company. Under this proposed tax increase, if they are successful and sell the company, the four who provided the capital will pay a tax rate that is half the rate of the person who managed the turnaround. Today, they pay the same tax rate.

The capital gains rate is for those who are investing in the company with their own money. The person ""managing this turn around"" is getting compensation for their services not a return on their investments. Anyone who is getting compensated for something other than a investment should be tax as income, as all other compensation is.

3. I do agree is not a great idea"

"3024","1460829848","&gt; Hillary Clinton recently blasted the hidden financial dealings exposed in the Panama Papers, but she and her husband have multiple connections with people who have used the besieged law firm Mossack Fonseca to establish offshore entities.

&gt; Among them are Gabrielle Fialkoff, finance director for Hillary Clinton’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate; Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining magnate who has traveled the globe with Bill Clinton; the Chagoury family, which pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative; and Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng, who was at the center of a Democratic fund-raising scandal when Bill Clinton was president. Also using the Panamanian law firm was the company founded by the late billionaire investor Marc Rich, an international fugitive when Bill Clinton pardoned him in the final hours of his presidency.

These aren't just meaningless connections by any stretch.

Edit: Sanders' points with respect to Clinton's judgement are likely further validated by this

&gt; Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York, said it would draw voters’ attention once again to Clinton’s ties to big money. “It certainly would play into Sanders’ narrative,” he said.

&gt; Sanders said Clinton’s support of a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Panama – one that he claims has allowed the wealthy to avoid paying taxes – should disqualify her from being the Democratic nominee for president.

&gt; “I don’t think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement, something I very strongly opposed, which has made it easier for wealthy people and corporations all over the world to avoid paying taxes owed to their countries,” Sanders said recently."

&gt; What worries me is whether Hillary has the confidence to make decisions contrary to her political interests. Can she say, “But it’s a really terrible idea”?

This. This uncertainty about what she actually believes in is what makes her so difficult for a lot of people to support. Even if you aren't on board with Sanders, you know what he stands for, and have to respect him for being unwavering on the majority of the issues for 30 odd years. "

&gt; The company wanted to “conduct uranium exploration, development, production and marketing operations and related activities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,” according to a draft of the shareholders’ agreement.

&gt; UrAsia, based in British Columbia, Canada, finalized a deal in September 2005 to buy uranium mines for $500 million in Kazakhstan, according to published reports.

&gt; The deal came after Giustra joined Bill Clinton in Kazakhstan for the launch of a Clinton Foundation health initiative and dined with him and Kazakhstan’s president, among others. The timing prompted questions about whether Bill Clinton played any role in the agreement. Giustra denied that, saying it came after months of negotiations.

&gt; The following year, Giustra, who is also involved in filmmaking and founded Lionsgate Entertainment, made a donation of more than $30 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to published reports.

&gt; In total, Giustra has committed $100 million to the foundation, according to at least one report, though foundation records don’t give an exact amount, saying only that he is one of the largest individual donors giving more than $25 million. In 2007, he started an affiliated charity that bears his name and initially kept its donors secret despite a 2008 agreement between the Clintons and the Obama administration to make public foundation contributors.

As a moderate liberal, I am very disappointed by these supporters of Sanders, who don't seem to have the right context.  Bill Clinton was jokingly said (even by many black peoples) to be the first black President.  The Clinton presidency has been largely viewed as a success, not just for liberals but also for the country.  Now, Sanders is running for President and he's trying to rewrite all of this.  And lots of people are buying this, including the Black Lives Matter folks.  With all due respect, you think George H.W Bush or any other President at the time could have done more for the African American community?  Now, they are turning against Clinton, demonizing his presidency.  This is absurd and obscene to any liberal who has a good memory of what happened in the 1990.

Remember this folks.  Bernie Sanders voted for the 1994 crime bill, which he now calls racist.   I don't know if Sanders has a hand in creating this, but his supporters are very extreme.

"3254","1460822827","The 1994 crime bill did not cause mass incarceration.  In fact, there's little evidence that it was even a major contributor to mass incarceration.

Here's the [total US prison population by year](http://i.imgur.com/BCNb3rT.jpg).  See if you can spot 1994.  

And here's the [change in the US prison population per year](http://i.imgur.com/C3SV0Yy.jpg).  Note that the rate of increase began declining right after the 1994 crime bill was enacted.

All data from John Pfaff, a Fordham law school professor and expert on mass incarceration.  Here's what Pfaff wrote in the NYT this week:

[Bill Clinton Is Wrong About His Crime Bill. So Are the Protesters He Lectured](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/magazine/bill-clinton-is-wrong-about-his-crime-bill-so-are-the-protesters-he-lectured.html?_r=0)

&gt; We know the act didn’t cause mass incarceration: Prison populations started rising around 1974, and by 1994 they had roughly tripled, from 300,000 to over one million. It’s almost surely the case that America was the world’s largest jailer well before the act was passed. So if the act didn’t cause mass incarceration, the question becomes: Did it help continue to drive it? The answer, by and large, is no.
&gt; 
&gt; For one thing, most of the act’s provisions applied only to federal crimes. The tough new anti-gang laws, the expanded death-penalty provisions, the three-strikes laws: All applied only to those tried in federal court. And those, over all, are fairly minor players, with the federal prison system holding about only 13 percent of all prisoners. The other 87 percent of inmates are in state systems — and none of the act’s new criminal laws affected what happened in state systems.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, there were some provisions of the act aimed at influencing state law. The most important was the Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing (VOI/TIS) Incentive Grant Program, which set aside about $10 billion to encourage states to make parole much rarer for people convicted of violent crimes, through what are called “truth in sentencing” laws. The grants even included funds for building out prison capacity, to deal with any resulting rise in inmate populations. If there was any part of the 1994 act that should have driven incarceration, it was this one.
&gt; 
&gt; And yet it didn’t. In a General Accounting Office study, only four states said the grants strongly influenced their decisions to adopt TIS laws. One of those four, New York, received more grant money than any other state, and its prison populations began a 15-year decline before the six-year program was even over. Almost half of the 27 states with TIS laws said the grants were irrelevant, and 23 states opted not to adopt the laws at all. All told, about 70 to 80 percent of all prisoners were held in states where the grants made no real impact. And there’s no evidence that prison populations grew any faster in states with TIS laws than in states without them."
"3255","1460823535","Pretty twisted thinking; Bill Clinton is morally responsible for the incarceration of people who broke the law and went to jail.

The unfortunate reality here is that publicly funded campaigns would still be weak if we allow unlimited donation Super PACs, as special interests/rich people would continue to dump *enormous* amounts of money into these PACs which would help negate the benefits of public funding. I don't think anyone sane is saying outlaw these groups, but rather limit donations to these ""social welfare"" groups / PACs just like regular campaign's are limited.

&gt;GEORGE CLOONEY:

&gt;Well, I've worked with Secretary Clinton as Secretary particularly when the Sudan and South Sudan were looking to vote for their own independence and it was an incredibly dangerous time for that country. And there were, you know, hundreds of thousands of people's lives at risk.

&gt;And between the Secretary and the Security Council and some of the people on the ground and Kofi Anan and Jimmy Carter and people like that and thousands of people on the ground, we worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen. She understood it. She understood the issues even though we don't have any great reason to pay much attention to Sudan. We don't trade with them. We don't get money from them. I found her to know, to be knowledgeable and to be-- and to care about the issues. And we've worked together since then and I've been a very big fan of hers. But I want to say this: I really like Bernie. I think what he's saying in this election is important if you're a Democrat. Again to have these conversations, I hope he stays in for the entire election and if he were to win the nomination, I will do whatever I can including if asked a fundraiser like this again to try to give him or her, Hillary, I hope she wins a Senate because honestly we see what happens when a President tries to get their Supreme Court justice confirmed without the Senate.

"3396","1460807921","Awesome. I'm glad, mainly because of the way the media has been trying to downplay and smear his visit. For example, been watching CBS News and here's some of what I've been seeing.

1st video segment:
CBS News anchor man explains a bit about what Bernie is going to talk about and how his values in a moral economy align with the Pope's, then the co-anchor lady finishes off the segment with ""It's important to note that the likelihood of him meeting with the Pope Francis is pretty low- in fact, he's probably not going to meet with Pope Francis and to sort of clarify too, he wasn't invited to the Vatican by the Pope but he was invited by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences- typically the Vatican does not light into issues related to politics though we have seen this Pope, ah, dabble here and there with some comments he's made along the way.""

2rd video segment:
Two CBS anchors offscreen discussing Bernie's trip. The first says that the Vatican says Pope Francis has no plans to meet with Sanders, the the second mentions how some are saying that Sanders lobbied to get the invite but that his campaign says the trip is not political. Meanwhile, the giant ticker running across the bottom of the video states ""CANDIDATE NOT LIKELY TO MEET POPE FRANCIS"".

3rd segment:
At the end if the video, CBS anchorman (live from Rome) Seth Dohn (sic) gives some obvious attitude as he says ""The Vatican has distanced itself from this invitation and has told us the Pope will not meet Senator Sanders. This trip was being billed as being above politics, Scott, but rather it seems to be all about politics.""


Edit to finish the post and correct typos as I somehow clicked submit before I was done."
"3397","1460799001","So, at the end of the day does this really surprise anyone?

This whole thing was so weird to watch unfold. Sanders comes out saying he was invited to speak at the Vatican and will meet the Pope and then the whole “no, he wasn’t invited!”-""maybe he asked for an invitation but he won’t speak!”-“maybe he’ll speak but it’s completely meaningless and the Pope won’t even be in the country!”-“okay, maybe the Pope will be in the country but he definitely will not meet Sanders!”-spiel started.

And now here we are, he was invited, he did speak and he did meet the Pope. Did anybody actually believe Sanders was lying?

Edit: Aaaand a quick glance at /r/HRC lets the spiel continue!

* The meeting probably never happened, reports are fake!

* If it did happen, it was a pity meeting!

* Maybe it happened, but meeting the Pope was definitely not worth leaving NY for! ^(also Sanders is a fraud for spending the money of poor college students on his family vacation)

* Meeting the Pope was the lowest move of his campaign so far!

You have to love American politics :’)

"3400","1460799121","&gt; The Vatican is loathe to get involved in electoral campaigns, and usually tries to avoid any perception of partisanship as far as the pope is concerned. Popes rarely travel to countries during the thick of political campaigns, knowing a papal photo op with the sitting head of state can be exploited for political ends.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Francis has been known to flout Vatican protocol, and the meeting with Sanders is evidence that his personal desires often trump Vatican diplomacy.

&gt; The invitation to Sanders to address the Vatican conference raised eyebrows when it was announced last week and touched off allegations that the senator lobbied for the invitation.
&gt; 
&gt; But the chancellor for the pontifical academy, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, said **he invited Sanders because he was the only U.S. presidential candidate who showed deep interest in the teachings of Francis**.

We also know that the Clinton Foundation was sometimes the recipient of those speaking fees, and that her server contained emails and documents related to the Clinton Foundation. We know that the contents of her server were backed up by a data management company who sorted those materials when the server contents were subpoenaed, and that a full record was stored in the cloud, apparently unbeknownst to Clinton or her team, and that that's how the FBI retrieved the 30,000 deleted personal emails. We also know that the Clinton Foundation is under investigation.
So, what if, if we speculate here a bit, those transcripts were on the server? What if they are now part of the FBI's investigations? She couldn't release them if she wanted to, and we can't get them through FOIA because she wasn't in office when she gave them.

Furthermore it seems to me to be totally principled to not vote for Hilary Clinton should she win the nomination.  We know the basic fundamental differences between these two candidates.  Voting for Hilary because she is the Democratic nominee means voting for everything you are against and these are fundamental differences that will effect the majority of people in this country and the world!  

Furthermore, if you look at the history of big changes in this country that were won by mass movements -- like forcing the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam, and it did not matter who was the president, Democrat or Republican.  When the people take the stage of history, it is like what Alice in Wonderland said about the Queen and her court, ""Why you are all a pack of cards""  They become a house of cards.

To add to this, I think if Bernie Sanders supports Hilary if he does not win, what will this do to the millions of supporters who have rallied to his cause?  What kind of demoralization will that cause.  What will it do to these supporters' belief that people can seem to strongly support the moral causes that Bernie supports and then turn around and support and campaign for the very people who are dead set against these positions.  It is like he just championed these positions like Hilary has been doing lately  -- just to win.

Think of what he has said about Pope Francis and then his turning around to support a person representing the antithesis of these views.

I am demoralized just thinking about this.  I was a radical in the 1960's -1970's.  I saw many becoming enamored of this or that Democratic candidate during elections and therefore stopping their protests against the war or for women's rights, etc.  Then, those people abandoned their campaign pledges  once they were elected.  There is no such thing as lesser evil.  Evil is Evil.

Read Malcolm X on the two parties.  Consider, that Martin Luther King was assassinated after he began to support the anti Vietnam war movement and to more further to the left on military and economic positions and to come closer to Malcolm X.  What might he have said about the Democratic Party.

"3601","1460838152","I'm not surprised they're with Bernie. I worked at a VERY well known social game company in San Francisco before the company went public and nearly collapsed.

I was so excited when I interviewed there. You could practically push the invisible piles of money out of the way when walking down the halls. The energy was amazing. Everything glittered with promise. I admit it, even at 40 years old, I got sucked right into the cult.

We had meals served in the cafeteria twice a day. Not just buffet, but you could get pizza and paninis to order. There were themed, fully stocked kitchens on each floor and a gym, arcade, and bar on the bottom floor. There was even an indoor basketball court. Yoga classes, acupuncture, and massages. Happy hour with free beer and wine on Fridays. Teams that were making money went to Vegas, Tahoe, even Hawaii.

My team started crunching shortly after I started and we had meals catered to our suite 3 times a day so we didn't have to take the time to leave to get food. Once a week they offered massages and acupuncture in one of our conference rooms so you didn't have to leave the suite. People started working until midnight, 2AM, and finally in the last couple of months some would get applauded for staying overnight. It became a hero culture - who can work the most hours, who's the most committed, who's giving it their all. It started to really feel kind of sick. Stress levels were insane. You'd feel guilty if you left before 9PM, and people often went home and then worked several more hours. If you weren't giving it EVERYTHING, you were failing the team and everyone knew it.

Some people thrived on it. I had a family, and I ultimately failed out from the stress of trying to balance that with the chaos and pressure of work. All of those perks could not make up for the pressure to perform and be a superhero. When I resigned, I could almost physically feel the weight lift from me. When I went back up to the suite after signing the papers with HR, someone said ""Wow, you look so... *happy*."" It felt like the first time I'd smiled in months. Not long after our game launched, the team was disbanded. Some were laid off, some were moved to other projects. Not too long after that the company laid off hundreds of people who had given them everything only to be discarded.

Anyway, my situation is not unique. I knew so many people who were also lured by the promise of perks and equity and eventually discovered they'd signed up for a treadmill that goes 12 miles an hour and will exhaust you before it throws you off. In the Bay Area that company was one of the biggest, but the culture isn't unique. "

-----------

Okay, I can see you're really emotional about this so I'll just try to respond calmly. :)

I've been an independent for 27 years (if it matters, I'm 45 and female). My first vote in a general was for Perot and the next two I think were for Browne.

In 2004, I not only voted for Kerry I plastered my U-haul with Kerry signs on my coast-to-coast move. I hated Bush SO much. I didn't love Kerry, and I thought (despite being a liberal) that the DNC was full of shit, but I really wanted us out of the war. It was at the DNC convention that year that I saw a young senatorial candidate give a speech. I turned to my (now ex) husband and said, ""Holy shit, that guy is going to be our first black President.""

I donated to Obama in 2008 and was ecstatic when he won. I really thought he was our best hope. I donated and voted for him again in 2012, but maybe with not as much enthusiasm. 

In all of this, I never registered as a Democrat. Although I aligned with them on some things and sometimes voted a straight blue ticket, I always felt like my vote was my own. *I* would decide which candidates I best aligned with. 

And to be honest, I have *never* liked the Clintons. I remember the Clintons when they were in office. Despite Bill being the ""cool"" President, I didn't like the way they aligned with the Republicans on too many things. Some things just felt really shady. I hated how both of them acted during Monicagate. 

So here we are now and it's 2016 and finally there's a candidate who I really like. He represents ME. He represents US.

So what does the DNC do? Everything they can to keep him down. From the debate schedule to the way DWS wouldn't even *mention* him during interviews the first few months. It was all Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. The way she spoke about him when the data breach happened. The way the top DNC folks spoke dismissively about him and glowingly about Clinton. The way Clinton herself tried to paint him as a sexist because he said people were shouting about guns. The way the Hillary supporters acted on social media. The way the actual media never covered him, or dismissed him when they did. The list goes on and on.

So if he doesn't get the nomination, I am supposed to do... what? Fall in line because the alternative is worse? What message does my vote send? Here's the answer: it says that I'm okay with how this whole thing went down. It says that I support Hillary's policies. It says I support the DNC and their coronation.

I'm sorry, but I've already lived through bad. I've lived through the crushing disappointment of having my candidate (Kerry) lose to the devil. As a country we survived it then and we'll survive it again.

But in the end my vote is my own, and it is not *owed* to anyone. 

If the DNC didn't want to lose my independent vote they should have backed the candidate I wanted to vote for. Don't blame people for not voting for the Democratic candidate. Blame the Democrats for not backing the candidate people wanted to vote for."

I realize that they feel this, but I disagree with their assessment.  There is simply no evidence that Hillary is the same as Cruz and Trump. 

&gt;A defeat for Clinton in November sends a message to the Democratic Party and its leaders to wake the fuck up. Stop playing the bullshit Republican game with Liberal social issues.

If you cared about social issues, then you are literally ripping off  your nose and spitting in your face.  You really do not understand what a Republican White House and Congress will entail.  They wrecked havoc last time, and they have only become more radically regressive. 

Not to mention, the ability to appoint more Supreme Court Justices.  You will be fighting years, if not decades, to roll back the harm caused by a Republican dominated Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. 

I am all for Sanders, but your argument lacks evidence and is all based on speculation that there will be enough Sanders supporters sitting out to ""punish"" Hillary and that the Dems will magically learn from this. 

The risks are not symmetrical.  There is true risk of a Republican WH, Congress, and SCOTUS, while you resort to a speculation about the future. 

In reality, your vote will matter little.  If you live in a politically dominate state, the vote your conscience.  If you live in a swing state, think twice about your actions. "
"3662","1460861382","I agree with everything you said except for your second bullet point.  While I agree Bernie's plan is best for the long term, I also believe a Clinton presidency could have enormous consequences in an eight year period; if she even lasts that long.

Her foreign policy is fucking terrifying.  The Neo-lib-con foreign policy of regime change needs to end before we get even more of the world population hating us.

Her economic plan does nothing as far as im concerned.  We'll continue to see lowered growth expectation while inequality grows even further.

Her lip service on social issues is flimsy at best.  I don't know where she truly stance on any social issue at this point.

She cool with sticking with Merrick Garland in the supreme court, which is a travesty.

Anyone saying she'll be able to get more done in a republican congress is kidding themselves.  Republicans **HATE** Hillary.  I don't think dems really realize this.  At least they work with Bernie on issues, they won't do anything with Hillary that shows her in a positive light."

Okay, I can see you're really emotional about this so I'll just try to respond calmly. :)

I've been an independent for 27 years (if it matters, I'm 45 and female). My first vote in a general was for Perot and the next two I think were for Browne.

In 2004, I not only voted for Kerry I plastered my U-haul with Kerry signs on my coast-to-coast move. I hated Bush SO much. I didn't love Kerry, and I thought (despite being a liberal) that the DNC was full of shit, but I really wanted us out of the war. It was at the DNC convention that year that I saw a young senatorial candidate give a speech. I turned to my (now ex) husband and said, ""Holy shit, that guy is going to be our first black President.""

I donated to Obama in 2008 and was ecstatic when he won. I really thought he was our best hope. I donated and voted for him again in 2012, but maybe with not as much enthusiasm. 

In all of this, I never registered as a Democrat. Although I aligned with them on some things and sometimes voted a straight blue ticket, I always felt like my vote was my own. *I* would decide which candidates I best aligned with. 

And to be honest, I have *never* liked the Clintons. I remember the Clintons when they were in office. Despite Bill being the ""cool"" President, I didn't like the way they aligned with the Republicans on too many things. Some things just felt really shady. I hated how both of them acted during Monicagate. 

So here we are now and it's 2016 and finally there's a candidate who I really like. He represents ME. He represents US.

So what does the DNC do? Everything they can to keep him down. From the debate schedule to the way DWS wouldn't even *mention* him during interviews the first few months. It was all Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. The way she spoke about him when the data breach happened. The way the top DNC folks spoke dismissively about him and glowingly about Clinton. The way Clinton herself tried to paint him as a sexist because he said people were shouting about guns. The way the Hillary supporters acted on social media. The way the actual media never covered him, or dismissed him when they did. The list goes on and on.

So if he doesn't get the nomination, I am supposed to do... what? Fall in line because the alternative is worse? What message does my vote send? Here's the answer: it says that I'm okay with how this whole thing went down. It says that I support Hillary's policies. It says I support the DNC and their coronation.

I'm sorry, but I've already lived through bad. I've lived through the crushing disappointment of having my candidate (Kerry) lose to the devil. As a country we survived it then and we'll survive it again.

But in the end my vote is my own, and it is not *owed* to anyone. 

If the DNC didn't want to lose my independent vote they should have backed the candidate I wanted to vote for. Don't blame people for not voting for the Democratic candidate. Blame the Democrats for not backing the candidate people wanted to vote for."
"3678","1460857642","True enough."
"3679","1460914121","I agree with all of this except:

&gt;They view Clinton on the same field as Trump and Cruz for her own faults

Let's not get carried away, alright? "
"3680","1460857778","I'm not a democrat and have no need to see a democrat 
I voted in the democratic primary for Bernie but that's it, im not obligated to vote for that party's nominee "
"3681","1460858640","&gt;YOU fail to realize is many people consider Hillary Clinton, in her own way, just as toxic as Trump or Cruz.

I realize that they feel this, but I disagree with their assessment.  There is simply no evidence that Hillary is the same as Cruz and Trump. 

&gt;A defeat for Clinton in November sends a message to the Democratic Party and its leaders to wake the fuck up. Stop playing the bullshit Republican game with Liberal social issues.

If you cared about social issues, then you are literally ripping off  your nose and spitting in your face.  You really do not understand what a Republican White House and Congress will entail.  They wrecked havoc last time, and they have only become more radically regressive. 

Not to mention, the ability to appoint more Supreme Court Justices.  You will be fighting years, if not decades, to roll back the harm caused by a Republican dominated Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. 

I am all for Sanders, but your argument lacks evidence and is all based on speculation that there will be enough Sanders supporters sitting out to ""punish"" Hillary and that the Dems will magically learn from this. 

The risks are not symmetrical.  There is true risk of a Republican WH, Congress, and SCOTUS, while you resort to a speculation about the future. 

In reality, your vote will matter little.  If you live in a politically dominate state, the vote your conscience.  If you live in a swing state, think twice about your actions. "
"3682","1460861382","I agree with everything you said except for your second bullet point.  While I agree Bernie's plan is best for the long term, I also believe a Clinton presidency could have enormous consequences in an eight year period; if she even lasts that long.

Her foreign policy is fucking terrifying.  The Neo-lib-con foreign policy of regime change needs to end before we get even more of the world population hating us.

Her economic plan does nothing as far as im concerned.  We'll continue to see lowered growth expectation while inequality grows even further.

Her lip service on social issues is flimsy at best.  I don't know where she truly stance on any social issue at this point.

She cool with sticking with Merrick Garland in the supreme court, which is a travesty.

Anyone saying she'll be able to get more done in a republican congress is kidding themselves.  Republicans **HATE** Hillary.  I don't think dems really realize this.  At least they work with Bernie on issues, they won't do anything with Hillary that shows her in a positive light."
"3683","1460857822","57% of voters can't stand Hillary. Her only chance is if more people that hate her stay home than people that hate her opponent. "
"3684","1460860236","&gt;They are sacrificing the longterm of their party for the shorterm gain.

Nope. Supreme court appointees is pretty long-term. Not that it matters, since this whole thing is just conjecture; you have no idea how younger people will feel about politics in 20 years, or what the political landscape will even look like then. 

"
"3685","1460871612","Exactly. I voted Obama the first time, protest voted the second time. We are offering the Democratic party our vote IF they nominate Sanders. I was never going to vote for Clinton. Its not a reprisal, its a gift they can accept or throw away."

How could anyone vote for someone so shady? Not me.. Not ever."
"3688","1460857935","For the sake of argument let's assume I concede that Hillary is as toxic as any of the GOP candidates.

Modern liberal voters want purity. Which is exactly what you do not get in a democracy. You get compromise and baby steps. Hillary is the candidate that is used to these compromises, which is why she looks so evil to the modern liberal. 

Of course it's because of this purity issue that we now have a majority of state legislatures controlled by republicans, the majority of governors are Republican, and the power of the Republicans in Congress.

The health care industry, the drug industry, are going to have to change the way they conduct business,"" she told Chris Wallace during her last presidential campaign. ""Business will take responsibility, but within a system that will actually get their costs down.""

""In the coming year, Clinton can be expected to turn back to this well-honed theme and to blame any of the health-care system's problems, which she has done more than just about anyone to advance over the years, on the greed of assorted special interests, rather than on the failure of the left's economic assumptions. She will be buoyed in these efforts by sharp increases in the cost of medical care and insurance, which she will blame not on the shortcomings of Obamacare, but on the avarice of doctors, hospitals, and especially the companies that manufacture drugs and medical devices. Health-care costs are likely to be a central theme in the next Presidential election.""

""Clinton's 2016 platform will no doubt focus on exercising that control as a means to forcibly lower prices to make the coverage itself, in her words, more affordable. Of course, Obamacare's problems go well beyond high prices. But even on the price issue, Clinton looks likely to offer yet another false premise. Prices aren't rising because businesses are exploiting Obamacare, as Clinton seems set to profess, even if some might be. Prices are going up mostly because businesses are following the law's dictates — rationally responding to an irrational framework that was invented largely by Hillary Clinton.""

I didn't feel like Bernie performed particularly well. He chuckled in response to HRC's attacks on his record on Dodd-Frank, on voting against credit controls on banks, and on gun control. And then he didn't clearly refute any of these points, so that was disappointing.

He said he wanted a ban on assault weapons when he first ran in Vermont, then he dropped it after losing the election. I expected him to have a better thought out position on gun control. 

Hillary also attacked him for not having a clear plan and I was disappointed that he didn't refute that.

Of course HRC pandered to the crowd and dodged questions like a pro. She's become a highly successful politician by saying two contradictory things at the same time and it's a habit she's afraid to break."

You just pointed out the primary problem in politics today - apathy and non-involvement.

As Pat Robertson correctly pointed out in 1990, the apathy that exists today allows an activist minority an incredible ability to select and elect their candidates. 

That's how and why the religious right was able to take over the Republican Party in the 60's through the 80's, take over thirty-one state legislatures, the House, numerous school boards and judge seats, appoint five ""conservative"" Catholics to the Supreme Court, and elect Reagan and GW. 

The question is - Will rational people get involved and take back our state and federal governments? "

&gt;[the meeting] took place at the papal residence

Not sure if that's meaningful at all, but pretty cool. It's cool to see Bernie fanboy over the pope the way so many fanboy over him."

As mentioned with the very short attention span, the HRC emails seem to be entirely forgotten about right now.

By the end of 2015, $3.24 million went to Clinton's campaign and $4.13 million went to the national committee.

Every wealthy person in Saudi Arabia is a ""Saudi Prince"" in the Saudi ""Royal Family"".  There are [FIFTEEN THOUSAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud) of them.  It's their government service title.

&gt;The family is estimated to be composed of 15,000 members, but the majority of the power and wealth is possessed by a group of only about 2,000.

And many of those have donated to terrorists or sent money to their wayward children who are terrorists, etc.  Just as many Americans have.  Ahem.

But that doesn't make Saudi Arabia, as a sovereign nation, a supporter of 9/11 as a matter of national policy.

The best analogy would be to claim that the US government was behind the bombing of the Oklahoma Federal Building because Timothy McVeigh's dad sent him money for Christmas...and his dad worked for the US Post Office.  Ahem.

That's clearly NOT the same as President Obama ordering the FBI to help McVeigh blow up one of our own buildings, is it?  Not even close.

The same is true of the actual Saudi Royal inner circle...who have been MERCILESS in dealing with Al Qaeda sympathizers over the years.  Beheadings en masse for anyone even remotely connected to AQ on the peninsula or elsewhere.

Which is what both parties, and quite frankly anyone who has paid any attention to this issue since 2001, already know, understand, and realize is a complete non-issue.

Sound familiar?

Obama says lots of things... 

His comments on Trayvon Martin as the trial was underway.
""My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" Obama said. ""All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves."" America did and Zimmerman was acquitted.

Obama's comments on the justified shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Mr. Obama said. “Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement — guilty of walking while black or driving while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentment and hopelessness.”. Outcome, Ferguson Riots.

In 2011 Obama sided with the Occupy Wall Street movement. 

""American people understand that not everybody's been following the rules,"" he said. ""These days, a lot of folks doing the right thing are not rewarded. A lot of folks who are not doing the right thing are rewarded. That will express itself until 2012 and beyond until people feel they are getting back to old-fashioned American values.""
 The movement went nowhere and caused major property damage where ever it went.

When in Egypt in 2009 speaking in Cairo he pledged, ""to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.""

As the Arab Spring began he commented, ""There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be."" He sided with the Muslim Brotherhood and further destabilized the Middle East...

Donald J. Trump had this to say.  


&gt;“Look, nobody has better toys than I do,” he told reporters at a hotel on Staten Island, where he pressed his case that the system was rigged against him. “I can put them in the best planes and bring them to the best resorts anywhere in the world.”  

&gt;But Mr. Trump said that was unseemly.
&gt;“You’re basically buying these people,” he added. “You’re basically saying, ‘Delegate, listen, we’re going to send you to Mar-a-Lago on a Boeing 757, you’re going to use the spa, you’re going to this, you’re going to that, we want your vote.’ That’s a corrupt system.” [source](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/us/politics/donald-trump-delegates-new-york.html?_r=1)

Don't forget that to deny Trump delegates they changed the vote in FLA to winner take all because they thought Marco or Bush would win.

It's very clear that many in congress don't like Bernie especially Barney Frank.

A small Washington firm named Policy Impact Communications helped create a similar group, the Central Asia Caucus, in late 2009.

"4475","1460851381","You should then vote for Trump then if Hillary is the nominee. 

Trump has been calling for [campaign finance reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America#2000_presidential_election) for two decades; Democratic candidate [Lawrence Lessig has even praised him](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/bernie-sanders-campaign-finance-lawrence-lessig). 

He doesn't have the usual [special interests groups funding him](https://youtu.be/IRFizyaCS4M?t=2458
). He turns down $10M+ contributions, while the other candidates take the money in exchange for political favors, most often in the form of [corrupt taxpayer funded contracts](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/11/02/pentagon-afghanistan-gas-station-boondoggle/75037032/) or [billion dollar subsidies](http://usuncut.com/class-war/10-corporate-welfare-programs-that-will-make-your-blood-boil/). Has called for all candidates to return the money they're getting back to Super PACs and to remove special interest groups from our election process, including [the ban of super PACs](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-return-super-pac-donations-215105).

He even frequently calls out [corrupt polticians for selling out their power to special interests](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/661555742193922050), especially the Koch Brothers"

Trump is the clear leader is outpacing hillary in NY which would be a devestating blow to democrats to lose in a presidential race, trump is winning on cross isle support, and has been doing it all while dragging 16 people through the primary proccess. And still they fight. If it had been anyone else they would have the nomination. On the otherside the super delegates skew that battle....its pretty aparent we live in an iranian style dictatorship."
"4480","1460886546","I don't see why it'd be any different about every other part of the primaries.. they're made to favor those with political advantages.. that's why they're there. Its shitty AF"
"4481","1460884851","The nomination is always about a candidate who is most likely to win the national election. That's how the party leadership sees it. So in effect I guess you could say it's rigged."
"4482","1460898977","Well, seeing all the shenanigans in AZ, and in other states where people are saying their voter affiliation was changed without them knowing, i'd say Trump was right.  "
"4483","1460885326","It is certainly an obvious narrative for him to push. But does that make it true?

The system is working as intended. If a single candidate cannot command a majority of delegates come the convention then the Party swings towards a contested or brokered convention. 

This is part of the rules of the game. The candidates get the chance to have (R) next to their name on the ballot paper. The price for this is, and has always been, to sign up to the Republican rules. That letter and that Party endorsement is the key to being competitive in the General. No candidate is forced to seek the Republican nomination. They do it because they would be blown out of the water as an independent. 

It is, at heart, about the Republican Party trying to win the Presidential Election. The Nominee is the vehicle but the Party is the one in the driving seat.

And now here we are, he was invited, he did speak and he did meet the Pope. Did anybody actually believe Sanders was lying?

Edit: Aaaand a quick glance at /r/HRC let’s the spiel continue!

* The meeting probably never happened, reports are fake!

* If it did happen, it was a pity meeting!

* Maybe it happened, but meeting the Pope was definitely not worth leaving NY for!

* Meeting the Pope was the lowest move of his campaign so far!

"4604","1460773810","Well, I don't want to question the clearly keen legal scholarship of Ms. Dawson, but what exactly about *Citizens United* is it that she wants overturned?

First amendment protections for corporations?  That was established long before *Citizens United*, and is the whole reason the New York Times is able to do really any of the things it does.  Nor is there any basis in the first amendment for extending press rights to corporations but not free speech.

Money as speech?  Okay, but that opens up a *lot* of side-door maneuvers to suppress both freedom of speech and of press.  If money spent to create or disseminate speech is not protected as speech, criticism of the government which requires any resources beyond ""going door to door"" could be limited.

Corporations aren't people?  Completely irrelevant and (as even Lawrence Lessig accepts) did not factor into the decision.

Sincerely,

While I agree with the general premise- that liberals need to hold Clinton accountable if elected, I don't have much faith she'll pull through in the ways that matter. 

It's likely to be four long years of ""I'll look into it"" on the serious issues like climate change, campaign finance, and regulation of industries like pharma and finance. I also think she's likely to distract from domestic issues with warmongering and sabre rattling."

She should have stopped the secret service from escorting that BLM protester so she could have a conversation on the topic and maintain freedom of speech. She shouldn't have yelled at someone about asking her a question based on truths and call them lies. She shouldn't have lied about her past, present, or future. She shouldn't have used a private e-mail server, and she shouldn't have done several things in her political career.

 ""Her caution, propensity for difference splitting""- She doesn't have a solid stance on the issues. Instead tries to dance around the question while giving a yes and no answer.

""her inclination to seek the path of least resistance""- Not when it comes to wars or invasions. But anyway, she knows where the grease in her pockets comes from. Its not about least resistance, its about the most contributions.

""is exactly what will enable liberals to pull her to the left once she's in the White House""- she is already as far left as she will ever be and she's still on the right side of this imaginary line."
"4916","1460996990","&gt; Sanders supporters will look at that evolution and say that it shows Clinton doesn't have the firm convictions of their candidate. 

That is not evolution.  It's political expediency.  If, for example, she really believed gay marriage was a right she should have said so publicly before 2012 instead of declaring the opposite many times.

Hillary will say anything to be president.

&gt; As president, Hillary Clinton will be as liberal as liberals force her to be. If they do their job, that could be quite liberal indeed.

As president, she will be as liberal as her corporate donors will allow her to be, or they will pull funding for her re-election campaign in 2020.  

Sure, she can say whatever she wants during any campaign, but, when it comes down to brass tacks America can expect another 8 years of the last 60 years.

 However think about it this way. Out of all the wealth the 8%  from your source holds, what percentage of that is controlled by the 60 wealthiest people on the planet? Most of it. Somebody who has 1 million dollars is in the 8%, along with people with 50 billion dollars. The top 60 are all billionaires.

"5040","1460837053","The inheritance tax is American and one of the best places to tax

The inheritance tax is often a point of contention between liberals and conservatives. As I will demonstrate, liberals are on the right side of this argument from both an economic and ethical standpoint. I will also debunk the common right talking points.

**From an ethical standpoint**

While Americans have a history of despising taxes, the inheritance is as American as you can get (when I talk about inheritance tax, I mean very large inheritances). Your lot in life should be based off of hard work, skill acquisition, education, experience, ingenuity, the value of your contributions to society, and perhaps a little luck. These are American values which liberals embrace. Conservatives, on the other hand, believe that your lot in life should be determined by the vagina you were born out of it. These are not American values. There is a fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives when it come to wealth creation.

It is also there to prevent large inter generational wealth transfers that could pervert a functional Democracy. America was founded on the idea that power and wealth was not handed down like Kings and Queens handed it down to their offspring, but created by individual endeavor.

**From an economic standpoint**

The inheritance is a very efficient tax. It does not create a lot of market distortions. For example, it is not like high sales tax, which could lead to people not buying as much as they would otherwise. If anything, large inheritances creates perverse distortions as it removes people from the labor force who would have otherwise participated. From an economic perspective it is difficult to find a more efficient tax.

**Common RW Talking Points.**

**It is theft** - If you take that view, then all taxes could be argued as theft, and you are essentially arguing from a point of anarchy.

**It is class warfare** - Every dollar not captured by the inheritance tax means that the government needs to tax elsewhere. This will lead to higher sales tax and/or higher income tax. Therefore you are pushing the tax burden onto the poor (sales tax) or working class (income tax). Essentially, you are waging class warfare also, but against the lower and middle income classes.

**It will bankrupt small businesses and farms** - No it won't. Only 0.003 of all estates are captured by the estate tax will be small businesses and farms, and they will owe a modest amount (14.3%). There is no evidence that these estates face liquidity constraints.
http://www.cbpp.org/research/impact-of-estate-tax-on-small-businesses-and-farms-is-minimal

**Parents should be able to provide for their children** - Most parents will not die until until they have grandchildren. Therefore, when they pass their estate onto their children, the ""children"" are already middle-aged and have a family of their own. Therefore, if your children are waiting for you to die in order to make something of themselves, then you failed as a parent. They should be financially dependent already. Plus, only large estates are tax, currently over $10 million. If your children cannot survive without more than $10 million in wealth, then you failed as a parent.

**It is double taxed** - So what and not quite true.  There is no law against double taxation and many things are doubled taxed.  Many of the end items you buy have already been taxed before in the production process, through at least labor, but then we also have a sales tax. 

Plus, it is not quite true.  Usually, capital gains are taxed when the asset is sold or disposed of and the gain is “realized.” But if a person holds an asset that grows in value until his or her death, that “unrealized” capital gain is forgiven, and neither the heir of the estate nor the deceased person is taxed on it. These unrealized capital gains account for a significant proportion of the assets held by large estates — ranging from 32 percent for estates worth between $5 million and $10 million to as much as about 55 percent of the value of estates worth more than $100 million (see pie chart). 
http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-the-estate-tax 

Cons hate the estate tax and would like to see it abolished. However, when asked where is a better place to tax, they come up short. Instead, they would rather tax current income, shift the burden onto the poor with higher sales taxes, increase taxes on home owners through higher property taxes. These taxes create greater economic inefficiency and ""punish"" current success, but sadly cons would rather punish current success rather than unearned success."

"5049","1460761496","Hilary is probably in the most stressful position of any politician could possibly be in a campaign.  

She has the FBI investigation looming which is bad enough for an elected politician but for someone *running* it's incredibly precarious. Whether she's guilty of anything or not, the FBI will interview her and try to catch her perjuring herself, which is very often how these things go.

Then we have these transcripts. Which is an impossible spot for her, there's bound to be something in them that is detrimental to her campaign. She can't clean them up and release them because that could cause someone else to come forward to contradict the content with video or something. Not to mention any day they could be leaked (and likely will be). 

Say what you will about Bernie but he is giving her a run for her money and really making her look bad in the primaries. He's a tough opponent to attack without making her look conservative. She's having to move a lot farther to the left than she probably wanted to (TPP, breaking up banks, more explicit rhetoric on income inequality, campaign finance reform, etc.) which will make it harder for her to move back to the center in the general and may come back to haunt her in office.

It would reveal that Clinton lied about the content of the speeches at a time when she suspected she would never have to release them, nor that their content would ever be known to voters.

It would reveal that the massive campaign and super-PAC contributions Clinton has received from Wall Street did indeed, as Sanders has alleged, influence her ability to get tough on Wall Street malfeasance either in Congress or behind closed doors.

It would reveal that Clinton’s policy positions on — for instance — breaking up “too-big-to-fail” banks are almost certainly insincere, as they have been trotted out merely for the purposes of a presidential campaign."""

It is interesting getting into a discussion with a Staunch Hillary supporter because they become entrenched when you are only discussing one or two issues. Regardless of the severity these issues are often dismissed as being republican agenda, or trivial. Even something as severe as taking money from special interests is seen as status quo, so why is it a problem? 

So to have a good listing of her record is a great reference tool to have on hand when having a discussion with anyone who supports Hillary. Oh sure you're not likely to even budge the staunchest of supporters, however it is very condemning to see all this together when discussing it with a Hillary supporter who is only voting for her because of either name recognition or because she is a woman. When you present the actual facts it is amazing how quickly people turn to Bernie who haven't drunken too much of the Hillary Koolaid and let go of all sense of reality. 

In addition to what you posted, i been putting together a spreadsheet of all the times that Hillary lied, flip flopped, been associated with someone corrupt, or has done anything questionable that would be indicative to a behavior more closely tied with known corrupt individuals. 

So between these 2 pieces of collected information I feel really good about talking to any fence sitter because I can present a really strong case why Hillary is an extremely bad choice for Americans, only represents special interests, and would only further eliminate the middle class and increase hardships on the poor.

We can draw a couple of conclusions from this. a)Sanders realizes he is not going to be the Democrats' nominee, and so he can afford to leave instead of working the New York campaign; it will make no difference to the ultimate outcome. b)Francis, who popularized the phrase ""moral economy,"" is, in addition to (or instead of) heading a major religious order, selling a secularist economic ideology through deceptive advertising, meddling in the political processes of foreign nations, and trying to conceal it behind equivocative comments. c)Sanders considers his role now to be one of promoting that marketing program for a ""moral economy,"" not winning the party's nomination."

Francis says, ""When I came down, I greeted them, shook their hands and nothing more. It's good manners.""

The pope then added with a laugh: ""If someone thinks that greeting someone means getting mixed up in politics, they should see a psychiatrist."""

The pope tells reporters traveling back to the Vatican with him that he decided to greet Sanders and the others because it was the polite thing to do.

Francis says, ""When I came down, I greeted them, shook their hands and nothing more. It's good manners.""

The pope then added with a laugh: ""If someone thinks that greeting someone means getting mixed up in politics, they should see a psychiatrist."""

Additionally, the DNC is aware that no extremist, liberal or conservative, has won a general election in recent memory. The last time a liberal was nominated it was Mondale. That wasn't a good result. If your memory doesn't include that unpleasant bit of history, no worries. You are about to see the same thing on the GOP side this cycle. They will get *crushed*.

And deservedly so, most of the people in this country are moderates. Which is why the DNC favors, and will nominate, a moderate.

Buprenorphine is also being looked at as a potential anti depressant and is currently being used as a pain killer in some instances (butrans patch).

It binds to the opioid receptors so strongly that it knocks off any other opioid drug currently in the system and makes it extremely difficult to get high off opiates while on it. The naloxone formulation makes it very uncomfortable to IV (and newer strip formulations make it even more difficult).

While it's still an opioid, meaning the patients would still be opioid dependent while on treatment, it has the capacity to interrupt many of the destructive patterns involved in opiate addiction, with a fraction of the side effects of methodone, and even without insurance it's cheaper than a street drug addiction. It has the potential to be a highly treatment for those who can get it. I really hope we see more proactive steps like the one Mr. Paul is taking.

If it wasn't for unions fighting the ""job creators"" we would be working seven days a week from the age of ten until we died. There is something wrong with that. The fact that wages were allowed to stay so low, all while corporate profits and equity markets soared prove there is a problem. If the lowest paid workers among us get paid wages that are below poverty levels. Then every single one us will be paid less. Maybe the price of goods and services would rise with an increase in the minimum wage, but I guarantee that those price increases don't outpace the rise in wages. That is nothing more than an excuse to keep as much of the profit made off the backs of the working class as possible.

"5504","1460739497","If you're interested in some insight into what capitalism really is and why it prevails, take a look at ""The New Spirit of Capitalism"" by Boltanski and Chiapello. 
One aspect to think about: Capitalism is a system without inherent ethic values, more so it lends them from the outside system. Which makes it adaptable in a way that it changes it's form when faced with criticism. 
In harsh words: we will not overcome the system ""capitalism"" in any way anytime soon, we won't change its ""heart"", only it's face."

"5506","1460764348","So a lot of people here are raising the good point of how since adopting capitalism the world has lifted many out of poverty and we've seen vast technological developments. As you praise capitalism, I encourage you to also take a step back. Look at the larger picture and in a more a abstract sense, try and dissect what capitalism is and why it's been successful. It's not that capitalism is some magic wand, it's a system that has underlying mechanisms which have brought us this growth. Ask yourself what those mechanisms are, and how we can strengthen those mechanisms. At the same time, look at the problems it has been unable to solve, and how we can fix that. Because while we've seen great growth, you can't deny the crummy materialistic consumer culture it promotes through constant manipulative advertisements to sell us products we don't actually need, and the amount of environmental damage we've caused for the sake of cost savings and convenience.

To me, what I believe has made capitalism successful is that it distributed power. It gave people much more control over their lives and their communities, where previously the decision making had come from the top down and people had mostly pre defined roles. It was too rigid. The people making the decisions were too far removed to even know what was going on or how their decisions affected the people, and obviously those making the decisions have their own interests held above others. Capitalism smashed this idea at first, but it hasn't solved it. Time and time again, our economic power gets concentrated again in the hands of the few, and the engine stalls."

The idea that if the US interests align with yours the Sate Department will help you seize power is scary AND frightens the shit out of a lot of small third world countries.

It is also incredibly bad for business.


Imagine that you are a left-leaning president of a small African country that has some mineral deposits, are you going to sell the rights to an american company that is going to try to fund your opponents so they can buy the elections and write the kind of legislation that they want, or are you going to look for more favorable partners?"

"5543","1460793887","The challenge for her would be to convince other countries that America's foreign policy goals are worth the trouble. It seems that other countries often invite America over. Say, some of Europe's Eastern countries are genuinely interested in getting America's help in countering Russia there. And Hillary is surprised when countries like Libya don't really want more American help.

I am not sure that Hillary would always use the Military first. But she would be willing to use Diplomacy first to impose her foreign policy goals, definitely.

They want to encourage companies to grow rather than just give the money to shareholders. Shareholders like this because it increases the value of the company and boosts their share value (which gets taxed when they sell).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7vrgwbS074


It is crushing to hear the world-known activist listing all the oppression in Honduras, how the illegal coup was carried out to benefit the oligarchs, how Hillary Clinton was the main thrust behind legitimizing the military coup, how her friends are getting assassinated for standing up to the foreign special interests that toppled Zelaya's government, the list of issues/demands the poor in Honduras are dying for...

... but most crushingly... she predicted her death and was fearful then for her life (before getting assassinated by the coup heirs to power in Honduras). She did not care... she was going to continue to fight on for justice and for the people of Honduras who don't have Hillary an email away to shill for their interests (unlike the oligarchs)."
"5727","1460750718","Just in case anyone's interested in a more nuanced take, including arguments for why the coup was actually a legal transfer of power (though maybe carried out illegally) and the surprising fact that people on the right criticized Hillary at the time for *opposing* the new government, here's some stuff I pulled together in a discussion on another forum:

First, criticism from the [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204518504574423570828980800) for not supporting the coup/transfer of power:
&gt;Ever since Manuel Zelaya was removed from the Honduran presidency by that country's Supreme Court and Congress on June 28 for violations of the constitution, the Obama administration has insisted, without any legal basis, that the incident amounts to a ""coup d'état"" and must be reversed....""The administration is standing by its ""coup"" charge and 10 days ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went so far as to sanction the country's independent judiciary. The U.S. won't say why, but its clear the court's sin is rejecting a U.S.-backed proposal to restore Mr. Zelaya to power....""Since June 28, the U.S. has been pressuring Honduras to put Mr. Zelaya back in the presidency. But neither Mrs. Clinton's spurious ""rule of law"" claims or the tire iron handed her by Mr. Obama to use against this little country have been effective in convincing the Honduran judiciary that it ought to abandon its constitution.""

Then, apparently the idea that the removal of Zelaya from office (though not his exile from the country, and perhaps not the way it was done) was legal and constitutional has a lot of support. (So does the idea that it wasn't, of course.) Here are some examinations of it, pro and con: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27état#Legality_of_ouster), [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2009/0721/p09s02-wogn.html), [CNN](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-295913).

That last is by Miguel Estrada, whom some of you may remember as a George Bush nominee to the US Court of Appeals who was rejected for being a conservative ideologue. So take it with however much salt you need. He is Honduran himself, though, and that article offers the most detailed account of Zelaya's actions that allegedly led to his ouster."
"5728","1460765072","God damnit. Read Wiki on this people.

President 1 tries to pass legislation illegally to make himself dictator.  
Honduras Supreme Court says stop, that's illegal, he doesn't stop.   
Honduras asks the US if they support ousting the guy trying to become dictator.  We say yes.  Honduras congress ousts him, has military escort him to airport and ban him from country.  
The guy replacing him then passes the legislation and makes himself dictator.  

K?  Got it?

Now let's all call Hillary evil for her major role in ousting a good, honest man and replacing him with a dictator.  Yay!  Facts don't matter!!"
"5729","1460734295","Clinton is a war hawk with the blood of thousands on her hands already. Electing her president will just continue this pattern of spreading death and destruction around the globe. More money for military contractors and war profiteers, none for infrastructure, renewable energy, universal single payer healthcare, and education.

We have to break this cycle and with the president controlling the executive branch, not electing Clinton is the most effective way to do this. Sanders would crush in the general election and his willingness to say no to more irration action like what happened in Honduras can make more of a difference than most are willing to acknowledge."
"5730","1460744738","Not quite, here's a less biased view from the Washington Post:
""Instead of condemning the figures behind the uprising, suspending support to the illegitimate government of Zelaya’s successor, Roberto Micheletti, and demanding a restoration of the democratically elected Zelaya, Secretary Clinton decided to move on. In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region “to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.” The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya’s ouster.""

He pointed to the Jimmy Carter campaign in 1980 and said that before Carter won the Democratic nomination, the campaign was “deeply concerned about the defection of pledged delegates.”
&gt;
&gt;“We don’t have a plan at the moment to be calling all the Clinton delegates, you know, once they get selected and try to persuade them individually to be for Bernie Sanders,” Devine said when pressed by a reporter. “But we do believe that if we can succeed in the second half of the process as much as Hillary did or even more so, that there will be enormous pressure on people who are going to be delegates at this convention to do the right, responsible thing.”"

"5781","1460843487","&gt;My question is- Couldn't these corporations just relocate their headquarters to another country with more lenient corporate tax policies, thus avoiding being taxed by the US altogether?

First, the rich [don't flee high-tax states](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/29/135813061/studies-rich-dont-flee-high-tax-states).  The same is true of countries.  There is a point at which wealthy people would leave a country due to high taxation, but simply raising taxes in a responsible way, as would be required for any bill to pass Congress, would not bring us to that level of taxation.

For example, he's proposing that income over $10 million - his highest proposed tax bracket - should be taxed at 52%.  For comparison, before Reagan's presidency in the early 80s, the highest tax bracket was taxed at 70%.  Reagan and Congress passed the [Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Recovery_Tax_Act_of_1981), which slashed the top tax bracket rate to 50%, just 2% less than what Sanders thinks it should be.  We had plenty of rich people in the 70s, 60s, and 50s.

Concerning corporations: Sanders has proposed policies that would save them money.  For example, he wants to replace health insurance with a Medicare For All single-payer system.  Health insurance premiums are one of the largest payroll expenses for US employers, even more so since Obamacare mandated health insurance for employees who work at least 30 hours per week.  A single-payer system would reduce healthcare costs by more equitably distributing the burden of paying for healthcare, removing the need to raise healthcare prices to make a profit for insurance company shareholders, and by giving the government more power to negotiate fair prices.

Next, when Sanders talks about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure improvements, like expanding public transit, fixing lead-contaminated water systems, and improving schools, he's talking about $1 trillion in federal contracts that would go to American companies.  Typically, such economic stimulus contracts require the contractors to purchase American-made parts and equipment when it is possible to do so.  That would be a massive business opportunity for American companies.

Raising the minimum wage would put more disposable income in people's pockets.  This would create more demand for products and services, which are business opportunities for providers of goods and services.  A strong middle class is the best engine for economic growth.  Providing the rich with low taxes won't cause them to open new businesses if there is not enough demand for their products.

From [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-100-economy-why-the-us-needs-a-strong-middle-class-to-thrive/257385/):

The...notion at the center of Hanauer's talk was that the innovators and businessmen are not, in fact, ""job creators""--that the fate of the economy rests instead in the hands of the middle class. So Hanauer wants to tax rich guys like himself more, to pay for investments to nurture middle-class families.

""We've had it backward for the last 30 years,"" Hanauer said at the TED conference. ""Rich businesspeople like me don't create jobs. Rather, they are a consequence of an ecosystemic feedback loop animated by middle-class consumers."" When the middle class thrives, he said, ""businesses grow and hire, and owners profit.""

Finally, and perhaps the most important point, Bernie Sanders is going to have to work with Congress.  There is no possible Congress that would pass a tax increase that would destroy the economy.  Economists and business leaders differ about exactly how high taxes could go before they begin to damage the economy more than they help it - and a lot of that depends on what the taxes are spent on - but it is simply a fact that taxes on the wealthy could be higher than they are without damaging the economy.  What Sanders would hammer out with Congress remains to be seen, but it is unrealistic to assume that his agenda would be enacted without carefully examining the economic consequences and tailoring the tax rate to avoid unwarranted harm.

If that last part throws some people and makes them think that his agenda won't happen, remember that almost every other major country on earth has achieved healthcare for all.  We can do it too.  Also, look at how Obama's been treated by Congress - would Hillary be treated any better?  Realistically, any Democratic president is going to face a Congress that's unwilling to cooperate until 2018 at the earliest, with 2020 after redistricting being more likely.  And finally, it's not just about what Sanders wants to do, but also about what he wouldn't do.  He wouldn't get us into another regime-change war.  He wouldn't agree to something like cutting Social Security as part of a bargain with Republicans.  He wouldn't appoint a Supreme Court Justice who doesn't want to overturn Citizens United.  He wouldn't let white collar crimes committed by powerful CEOs go unpunished.  He wouldn't use the DEA to crush the legalized and medical marijuana vendors in states that voted to allow it."

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window. I highly doubt that a candidate like Clinton will be elected again, but who knows

It's so hard to tell what's really going on at a geopolitical level, but Hillary's legitimization of the new Honduran regime just seems super suspect to me.

Many other countries refused to recognize the post-coup government and refused, in protest, to observe the quick fix ""free election"" Hillary negotiated.  

Our allies wanted nothing to do with the election, because it was a sham - 

&gt;While observers were touched by the commitment, courage and enthusiasm of the many Hondurans who participated in this process in good faith, they were also saddened by the numerous discrepancies, lack of preparedness and resources, bribery, voter intimidation, violence and fraud that they witnessed. According to Dale Sorenson of the Task Force on the Americas, the observations documented in the delegation report “demonstrate a clear pattern of systematic undermining of the Honduran people’s right to a free and fair election.”  http://afgj.org/honduras-election-monitoring-report

and

&gt;""On election day, November 29, there were a number of incidents that confirmed the climate of repression in which the electoral process took place, which represented the consolidation of the coup d'etat of June 28th."" Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL)

And, seems the coup was successful - http://fpif.org/anatomy-election-fraud-stealing-2013-honduran-election-five-simple-steps/

EDIT:  Now I think about it, there are only 2 possibilities

1) HC had some conflict of interest to support the coup leaders. I can't begin to guess what but I guess Obama did too, since ultimately it was his call.  

2) HC was naive enough to think the leaders of a coup would be sure to run a free and fair election.  Or, let's say it wasn't a coup, she was naive enough to think the kind of people who would issue a secret warrant, arrest the elected President in the middle of the night in his pajamas and extradite him in violation of their own constitution would be sure to run a free and fair elections.

"6026","1460770154","This is a repost about the US involvement in regime change in Honduras -   
  
&gt;Dude, it's Honduras. They have by far the highest homicide rate out of any country in the world. More than half as many people are murdered there per year than in the United States, even though their population is only 8.5 million. Their GDP per capita is about $2400 per year, making them one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere.  
  

&gt;Honduras wasn't going to turn into a utopia if the US government cut off much needed aid, which was not required by law, because it was not a military coup, and normal constitutional and electoral function resumed very quickly afterwards. The supreme court was legally entitled to order the president out of office.
  
  
&gt;The real goal in a situation like that is to avoid a civil war, which was a very real possibility. And if the US had taken a strong stance against the new government, and war broke out, they would have been obligated to intervene. That point cannot be stressed enough.
  
  
&gt;To drive that point home, I will give you an example of how you can really fuck that kind of thing up.
  
  
&gt;At the end of the Gulf War in 1991, anybody that had anything to do with the military or foreign relations in the US government was badly in need of a vacation. Thousands people who normally work 40 hours a week had been working 70 hours a week for six months, and more than half a million US military personnel had been in full war mode for even longer.
  
  
&gt;Time to take a breather, right?
  
  
&gt;Wrong. Really wrong.
  
  
&gt;At that exact point in history, the USSR was collapsing. So no time off for anyone.
And in that context, the US made some rather subtle mistakes in their messaging, which is understandable. Unfortunately, as a result, the Iraqi Kurds got the impression that the US would support them of they rose up against Saddam.   
  
  
&gt;But the coalition had avoided invading Iraq precisely because they had achieved their objectives, and didn't want to get caught up in Iraq's ethnic squabbles.
  
  
&gt;The Kurdish uprising was subsequently brutally crushed.
  
  
&gt;It was a lesson for future US administrations. If you give even tacit support for a resistance movement, they might expect you to help them.
  
  
&gt;So when Honduras happened, they kept their mouths shut, and maintained the status quo.
Since you are clearly passionate about this (which I appreciate) I would ask you what you would have done if you were the president of the US when that happened.
  
  
&gt;Keep in mind that at that exact moment, the following things were demanding attention and resources from the Whitehouse:
  
  
&gt;-There were 135,000 troops in Iraq. There were also 50,000 in Afghanistan, where the violence was spiralling out of control.
  
  
&gt;-The global financial crisis was still a huge issue, and the US economy was struggling badly. People were abandoning their homes in large numbers, and tent cities were becoming a common sight in major cities.
    
  
&gt;-The ACA battle, which was to be Obama's signature legislative achievement as President, was in a critical stage.
  
  
&gt;-The Tea Party movement had picked up real steam. People were bringing assault rifles to protests, and talking openly about overthrowing the government by force.
  
  
&gt;-The new H1N1 virus was spreading rapidly in the US. By the end of the year, it would kill more than 3,000 Americans, and put more than 25,000 in hospital, making it more substantial in terms of human damage than either Pearl Harbour or September 11th. "

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "

Sorry but when you are a president you are supposed to be the leader and others should follow you and not the other way around. This is something I miss in Hillary.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

I personally don't think that because Bernie Sanders agrees with one side of the republican policies, that democrats should see that as a negative. To me, thats a positive.

"6171","1460732819","how exactly did he ""win"" last night? he had a rubio moment when hillary pointed out that she wanted to take steps to address climate change while bernie has failed to even take a first step in the senate. ""we have a crisis! we have a crisis! we have a crisis!""

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."
"6172","1460761248","This article perfectly sums up why I'm so torn between the two of them.

&gt;It's that in the history of political rhetoric, no one has ever been inspired by a pragmatist...What Sanders has going for him is that Democrats want to believe in his vision. And when people are asked to choose between their dreams and hard realities, they tend to pick their dreams.

I'm a fairly realistic person so to pragmatism of Hillary really speaks to me. But on the other hand, part of me really wonders if we need someone with Sander's type of grandiose vision to really push the US to make meaningful progressive change, even if he fails to accomplish his goals in the long term (which is what is most likely in my opinion)."

The original version still concedes that temperatures are rising.  

Here's what I'd indicate if you honestly don't buy into global warming.  Let's accept that the atmosphere is huge, and it is difficult to believe that human factors can influence it.  Think of it this way instead.  Think about how large your own body is.  Think about taking a pill for something (let's say a headache).  The pill is sooo small relative to your body size.  And yet, it affects your body pretty significantly.  

The same is true about global warming gases.  While it is true that the Earth's atmosphere is very large, it is also true that all that has to happen for us to affect the atmosphere is throw up a couple parts per million of carbon dioxide into it.  We've been doing that for at least the last 100+ years, and it is just staying there.  

Whether this article is true is irrelevant, since it concedes that temperatures are rising.  Whether we like it or not, we need to do something about it...going back to the analogy, it is basically a poison pill we've all collectively ingested.

"6188","1460840419","It might help to clarify what is actually occurring - and why it is occurring.

As nations industrialize, labor demands get more complex.  Where once it was sufficient to have a willing attitude and a strong back, now laborers need a decent mind to go with it.  They need to learn and apply more complex, narrow skill sets.

But as other nations also move through this process, they start at the low end first - and are able to deliver the low end labor far more efficiently.  As a result, there is minimal demand in the more developed nations for low end labor.

However, there are still *people* at the low end, without the specialized skills they'd need to get better jobs.

Effectively, there is a 'gap' in the labor market where many people fall but no jobs exist.  So those people are forced into the unskilled labor market.

If you raise the minimum wage, you can close this gap somewhat.  But you do so at the expense of the people who would ordinarily be in the unskilled labor market (as opposed to being defaulted into by lack of slightly-more-skilled jobs).  Moreover, the slightly-more-skilled class is still 'underutilized' since they're just getting paid a bit more to do unskilled labor jobs rather than jobs that match their abilities.

Some of those people can potentially be retrained to get them 'past the gap' and into decent jobs.  But, frankly, most of them are either unwilling or unable to make that transition.  They're stuck in a world where the jobs that match their abilities are done by foreigners and all the jobs that are left either exceed their abilities or aren't worth their time.

To make matters worse, raising the minimum wage also encourages the *elimination* of those low-end jobs via automation.  So while you can potentially employ some of those 'gap' workers at jobs they really shouldn't be doing in the first place for semi-decent wages, you're throwing even more people out of work.

I don't believe anyone has come up with a particularly 'good' fix for this problem.  Raising the minimum wage is almost strictly worse than a policy such as guaranteed basic income due to the job-killing impact it has.  Better early education could potentially pay off - if anyone could figure out how to actually deliver it to poor people.  Easier adult trade education/re-education might help out, but there are limits.

But most of the proposals we're seeing from politicians fit nicely into the ""simple, easy and wrong"" category - such as minimum wage increases."

&gt;The energy of the Sanders campaign will almost certainly fade away.

And with their youth, they can play the long game, if they choose to.

This part in particular is very illuminating.  If Bernie gets elected, I'll cry, and I plan on being an active advocate for his policies with the same energy that I've used in his presidential campaign, but if that doesn't happen, but progressives do slowly take over the Democratic Party and Bernie's Medicare-For-All system becomes a reality in 20, 30, or 40 years, I'll cry in that situation too, and it'll probably feel even more rewarding considering the decades worth of effort that went into it.

&gt;The problem with this new wrinkle in Hillary Clinton's K-12 education agenda is the assertion that the federal government is to blame for over-testing. Nothing could be further from the truth. On average, federal policies account for seven hours of testing per year – roughly 0.6 percent of an average school year. The time students spend on assessments required by states and school districts is, on average, two to three times that required by the federal government.

"
"6340","1460928574","&gt; While Clinton offered no substantial policy solutions during the portions of the interview concerning education, she at least underlined one indisputable fact: She knows more about K–12 education than any other candidate remaining in either party’s race. In a way that’s not saying much. Jeb Bush had clearer solutions, spelled out in detail, in his platform. Maybe they wouldn’t have worked, but at least they were there. Since his departure from the race, education journalists have had to make do with the candidates’ offhand education comments.

3. I have no words:
&gt;She says she’d like to see more gender-specific schools, especially for impoverished students, and she also mentioned “boarding schools for poor kids.”

4.THIS, SO MUCH THIS....
&gt;
Even with her apparent depth of knowledge, Clinton left me unimpressed. Over a couple of winding answers to pretty clear questions from Newsday, Clinton managed to show how much she knows while simultaneously saying nothing of value.

I like his principled stances, I like that he isn't taking big money, I like that he is hard on corporations, and that he is really the only candidate that might be able to impact income inequality. I also like his stance on global warming and foreign policy. I like how he treats minorities as equals, I don't hear divisiveness when he discusses their problems.

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

- What the hell is with Bernie's taxes? There is tons and tons of precedent for candidates releasing all of their taxes. Why is he being so shady about it? His excuses are lame and shouldn't be accepted"

"6354","1460731742","No, it was basically a tie.  A tie isn't enough right now.  What killed him was not being able to tie Clinton taking money from Wall Street to any actions she has done.  "
"6355","1460751991","﻿ I have disagreed with Paul Krugman's blogs about Bernie Sanders--his faulty analysis of the Daily News interview, and his sneering depiction of Sanders at every turn as in ""the revolutionary isn't cute any more."" His inability to say anything positive about the man, such as his passion, vision, his consistency, his strength in Congress sponsoring and co-sponsoring bills (across the aisle and with Sec. Clinton), his resonance with many, many voters, any of his policies. This indicates to me not reasoned, authentic political thinking, but a smear campaign. But today Paul Krugman and I agree on something. I found it deeply disturbing that in the Brooklyn debate last night that Sanders reiterated his remark that he lost the South because it's conservative. He lost among African American voters. His remark effectively dismisses them as conservatives, and that's a problem. I don't think the remark accurately reflects his positions and actions concerning systemic racism in this country. But he should hear the problem in his remark and stop saying it, and say why he was wrong to say it. I have been pondering why many African Americans in the Southern primaries (including in my small Virginian town) voted for Clinton. Of course, there are multiple reasons and points of view. But I don't think it has been conservativism. And I don't think it's necessarily affection for the Clintons. People I know said, ""She's electable."" I think African American voters deeply understand the gravity of the situation, more than most white voters probably. A white friend in a predominantly Black union in Philadelphia said that when she asked the question, people said, ""Bernie who?"" The longer the campaign goes on, the more people will be able to answer that question. But Bernie Sanders needs to understand what's wrong with calling a predominantly African American vote (in my town almost all Democrats are Black and almost all Republicans are white) ""conservative."" And he needs to fix it, publicly."
"6356","1460753760","I watched the debate and I am blown away by Sanders.  He did amazing and I want to do everything I can to support him.

She is a crook."

&gt;It's not absurd for the average person to wonder why stockholders would agree to pay huge amounts of compensation to those who can't turn a profit.



OP,  if you buy 100 shares of a company for $10 per share and those share prices rise to $50 per share,  would you care if the company wasn't ""turning a profit""?  Wouldn't you want to compensate the ceo for raising the price of those shares? Case in point,  Amazon would consecutively not have a profit, but they grew immensely.

"6374","1460897633","This is one of those discussions where we don't have all the facts and probably never will. 

If a business is legitimately spending all the money that comes in then they shouldn't need to pay taxes. Problem is we don't know how they are going about getting to zero.

And even if a company isn't making a profit it is still paying employees who pay taxes. The CEO and the board of directors are all paying taxes.

If a mom and pop business did the same thing the IRS wouldn't necessarily disallow it. They would make you prove it was a business and not a hobby. That rule is in place to keep people from starting a cake baking ""business"". Selling two cakes at their kid's bake sale. Then trying to write off all their groceries for the year.  

If you had a hobby that made money you would be expected to pay taxes on that money. But you could certainly offset your profit with any expenses. i.e. if you spent $9 baking a cake and sold it for $10 you would only pay taxes on the $1 profit. But if the cake cost you $11 to make and you sold it for $10 you wouldn't be allowed to write off the dollar.

I read an article years ago about a stripper that wrote off her breast implants. The IRS called her on it. She proved that she made more money because of it so they allowed it."

"6378","1460897633","This is one of those discussions where we don't have all the facts and probably never will. 

If a business is legitimately spending all the money that comes in then they shouldn't need to pay taxes. Problem is we don't know how they are going about getting to zero.

And even if a company isn't making a profit it is still paying employees who pay taxes. The CEO and the board of directors are all paying taxes.

If a mom and pop business did the same thing the IRS wouldn't necessarily disallow it. They would make you prove it was a business and not a hobby. That rule is in place to keep people from starting a cake baking ""business"". Selling two cakes at their kid's bake sale. Then trying to write off all their groceries for the year.  

If you had a hobby that made money you would be expected to pay taxes on that money. But you could certainly offset your profit with any expenses. i.e. if you spent $9 baking a cake and sold it for $10 you would only pay taxes on the $1 profit. But if the cake cost you $11 to make and you sold it for $10 you wouldn't be allowed to write off the dollar.

I read an article years ago about a stripper that wrote off her breast implants. The IRS called her on it. She proved that she made more money because of it so they allowed it."

&gt;It's not absurd for the average person to wonder why stockholders would agree to pay huge amounts of compensation to those who can't turn a profit.



OP,  if you buy 100 shares of a company for $10 per share and those share prices rise to $50 per share,  would you care if the company wasn't ""turning a profit""?  Wouldn't you want to compensate the ceo for raising the price of those shares? Case in point,  Amazon would consecutively not have a profit, but they grew immensely.

&gt; The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also won’t explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

&gt; ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

&gt; ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

&gt; Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldn’t get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

Nides was also involved in the [scandal](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/12/ethics_complaint_seeks_to_uncover_facts_in_hillary_influencepeddling_scandal.html) involving Clinton’s efforts to provide special access to State Department officials for hedge fund clients of her son-in-law, Marc Mezinsky.

"6448","1460750890","&gt;Judicial Watch announced today it has obtained new documents from the Department of State containing the telephone transcripts from the evening of September 11, 2012, in which then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informs then-Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil that the deadly terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi “had nothing to do with the film.”  The documents include previously unreleased telephone transcripts with world leaders about the Benghazi attack.

&gt;Clinton’s admission to Kandil was first produced to the Select Committee on Benghazi on October 13, 2015 and publicized on the day of Mrs. Clinton’s testimony, October 22, but court filings in Judicial Watch litigation show that the record was only produced after two federal court judges ordered the State Department to produce more Benghazi-related records to Judicial Watch.  Similarly, Judicial Watch litigation also forced the release of the September 11, 2012 email in which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed her daughter by email that the attack had been staged by an “Al Qaeda-like group,” rather than as the result of “inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” as Mrs. Clinton had claimed in her official public statement one hour earlier."

"6455","1460828659","So it turns out Obama AND Hillary lied to the American people through their teeth.

Why?

Could it be because it was in the middle of the election and Obama wanted the public to believe Al-Qaeda was not a major threat?"
"6456","1460750809","Good, the more we know the easier it is to see her lies. "
"6457","1460750972","what is it proving? are you kidding me, she said it was a video to all the families of the dead they went on talk shows and said it was a video they said it was a video for weeks when they knew it was a planed attack the next day. who gave the stand down order that killed our people that's what we want to know

Well for one it puts the lie to her claims that Benghazi was touched off by the video, which is what she and her envoys preached for weeks afterward, including to the families of the dead.

At 10:08 p.m. on September 11, Mrs. Clinton issued an official State Department press statement, approved by the White House, placing the blame for the attack on an Internet video:

...

Yet the next day, in her 7:49 PM September 12 conversation with 
Kandil, Clinton said, “We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do 
with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest.” Kandil 
responded, “You’re not kidding. Based on the information we saw today we
believe that group that claimed responsibility for this is affiliated 
with al-Qaeda.”

So by the very next evening she was talking to world leaders and telling them they knew it wasn't about a video. It was terrorism, straight up. But they changed the talking points to hide the terrorism angle because it was an election year and Obama had been running on the platform that al Qaeda and other terror orgs were ""on the run.""

It was a baldfaced lie told to the American people, and it was told so Obama could retain the White House and Hillary could still pretend that Libya was a feather in her cap for 2016, instead of a miserable failure."

If it's just embarrassing or inconvenient or such, let it loose, get it out and over with, and move on.

Which means that it's the third:  It's a powerful problem, and they're not letting it go, lest it wrecks the campaign... which itself will wreck the campaign because it won't be ignored or forgotten. 

If she thinks that the GOP, much less Bernie, is gonna let that slide... yeah, that's just dumb hope on her part.

I think it's bad news for her campaign, honestly.  But the only way to know is to get 'em out there."
"6464","1460793148","We pretty much know what Hillary said in those speeches. [Various people who attended those private speeches has been interviewed by the media, and they described those speeches as the gushy.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/clinton-speeches-218969) Some reported that she sound like a managing director. We know that in those speeches she definitely did not go and tell them to cut it out. Before Sanders and Trump, taking money from Wall Street was just par for the course. Everyone on the GOP did it and Hillary probably did it less than all of them, so it was no big deal. But then Sanders and Trump came around, and all of a sudden those speeches became completely toxic. 

So I am pretty sure that is exactly the smoking gun we are looking for. Not like secret promises to work with them for favors or anything. But like, ""you guys are heroes, you help drive this economy and are a big reason why America is the great country that it is."" Stuff like that. Empty platitudes in the past, but will sink her campaign now. We know that is at least in there, and that is probably good enough. 

If she say anything about running for president or become the future president, that is illegal and we can pack up and go home. I personally don't think that is in there, cause she is a lawyer by trade and would not do something so stupid. If there is a Freudian slip, which is entirely possible, then she is in some real shit. 

Here is my biggest worry. Those speeches were pretty public events, each had thousands of people attending, and she made a lot of them. So it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a recording out there somewhere. this is completely expected. I am worried that someone is waiting to release them in the general election. I know trump would put up a million dollar bounty for a recording, and frankly i think they are sitting on one already. 

This combined with the active FBI investigation into her emails which already shows she has been at least careless with classified material. We are just waiting to see if that carelessness adds up to negligence or gross negligence. 

The amount of risk the DNC is taking with Hillary is unimaginable with anyone else. Frankly it is amazing the democratic establishment has allowed it to get this far. "

"6468","1460783973","I'd say it's fairly likely, otherwise why not simply release the transcripts? We already know that in prior speeches she blamed the ""irresponsible borrowers"" for the 2008 crash rather than the banks buying bad loans that they knew were made by predatory loan officers. I can't imagine the rest of her speeches are really that good.

Even if she was just blowing smoke up their asses, it won't appear that way to the public."
"6469","1460785667","At this point all the damage that can be dealt from her not releasing them has been dealt.

 And if she does release them, even if there's nothing particularly damming in them, literally every single word will be pried apart and any sentence in any context that could possibly be construed as ""bad"" will be prime ammunition against her, even if it's not that big of a deal.

Releasing them now, regardless of what's in them, would be a strategically unsound move for that reason.

 That's why she just tosses out a lame excuse she knows will be unpopular. Because she knows that not releasing them can only possibly hurt her so much, and right now it's about as much as it can get. But releasing them, regardless of their contents, opens up the floodgates for *new* controversy"

"6473","1460786021","It's illegal to give paid speeches if you're running for president. If in one of those speeches she said something to the effect of 'she'll protect the banks when she's elected' she is fucking done."

"6475","1460784099","There's no point in giving Bernie ammo that plays right into his stump speech rhetoric, especially when she's clearly winning.

It's amazing how many people I've spoken to had no idea about this incredibly important distinction. Clinton's stance is actually the fucked up one in that she wants to allow people to sue under *any* circumstances. One of the simplest analogies of her stance is you'd be able to sue a hammer company if you were injured by someone attacking you with a hammer.

Edit: [Source:](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-gun-policy/)

&gt; Manufacturer Liability: Gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the misuse of their products, just as any other industry isn’t held accountable for how end-consumers use their products.

&gt; Bernie believes that gun control is largely a state issue because attitudes and actions with regards to firearms differ greatly between rural and urban communities. Nevertheless, Bernie believes there are situations where the federal government should intervene. **He voted in favor of requiring background checks to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of felons and the mentally ill, passing a federal ban on assault weapons, and closing loopholes which allows private sellers at gun shows and on the internet to sell to individuals without background checks.**

&gt; To what extent does Bernie believe that gun regulation should be a federal issue?

&gt; Bernie has voted in favor of a nationwide ban on assault weapons, a nationwide ban on high-capacity magazines of over ten rounds, and nationwide expanded background checks that address unsafe loopholes.

"6546","1460987397","He hasn't changed his stance.  He said they have the right to sue.  That is not debatable.  But he also said, if the government allows a company to sell a product, in this case guns, and they sell that product within the law, then you cannot hold them responsible when somebody who legally obtained a gun, kills people.  If that gun co./ dealer, for whatever reason, *did not* follow the law and allowed somebody who should not have a gun, get a gun... *Then* you can hold the Co. or dealer responsible.  But regardless, anybody can sue at any time- it's up to a judge at that point.  Why is this so hard to understand?  Or is it just people trying to make something, out of nothing.

Add that to his extreme anti-gun stance of [wanting to ban any gun ""used to kill people - not used for hunting.""](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTvD0DFYh9s)

"6654","1460973809","I had to go through 3 different links to see the original study because this is rehosted content. 

The methodology of this study is highly flawled.

Support for Hillary dipped 8% in men after answering about the distribution of the income in the family.

There is no reason to think that this effect happens outside this specific set of conditions and the ""distractor question"" is not neutral.

This result may simply mean that men are more likely to be against Hillary Clinton when they are reminded of economic issues. "
"6655","1460974726","People who are saying that ""it is because she's evil"" clearly didn't read the article. The authors did a polling experiment where they asked two different groups of people different sets of questions. 

Group A was asked about whether they would vote for Clinton over another candidate. 

Group B was primed to think about gender and then asked whether they would vote for Clinton over another candidate. 

Group B was less likely to vote for Clinton than group A. Which means that we cannot use ""Clinton is the devil"" as a reason to explain the disparity in vote, because Clinton was Clinton for both groups. [This](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/03/24/gender-is-costing-hillary-clinton-big-among-men/) is an article that explains this perhaps a bit more clearly.  

Also, people saying ""she gets votes because she's a woman!"" it seems that she does. Among women. She loses votes among men. 

That being said, I am always cautious about how such experimental work will translate to actual voting. The logic of the experiment is that when prompted to think about ""gender role threat,"" people tend to vote to reinforce gender roles that they see as preferable. The big, unanswerable question is how that ends up translating to a general election campaign, with tons and tons of different inputs and signals. I don't know and I don't think the author does either. 

I think this is a fairly interesting and supportable conclusion, however, give the results of his experiment: 

&gt;So, Sanders’ advantage over Clinton in the general election polls doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with his appeal to young people, or his policies: his advantage can be explained entirely by the fact that he’s a man."

2.) to aggressively challenge any and all voter dis-enfranchisements. Voting should be a constitutional right! Americans should have the right to vote in a fair process free of party corruptions, free of gerrymandering, and free of false choices between 'lesser of two evils'. How to accomplish that technically?

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.  
e.) All states should switch to vote by mail.
f.) Each ballot should have a durable carbon copy record for auditing purposes that shall remain legible at least 10 years in the humid Southeast.

Citing hundreds of thousands of annual marijuana arrests, racial and economic disparities in marijuana enforcement, and the role of prohibition in keeping marijuana prices high and lucrative to violent drug dealers, the physicians say that creating a legal and regulated marijuana market is the best way to ensure public safety, combat the illicit drug trade and roll back the negative consequences of strict enforcement policies on disadvantaged communities."

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change.

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

&gt;""No, I won't release the transcripts, and here's why. **Bernie Sanders doesn't care what I said**. Not one bit. He hates that I made the speeches. He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

Yes, it's condescending. Yes,  it's denying some people what they want. But I don't see how her obvious lie and dodge is benefiting her, particularly as she has to repeat it over and over.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

The Clinton revolution was basically founded on ""New Dems"" newfound role as hippie punchers, so triangulating against a hippie is making Hillary sound increasingly schizophrenic."
"7040","1460692526","She looked so bad in this answer because it truly seemed like she was trying to mislead people into thinking she's for a $15 federal minimum wage. If that's not what you're for just explain your stance please."
"7041","1460719015","it seemed like a fairly straight forward answer. Her stance is to push for a federal minimum of $12. If a bill somehow passes for $15, she is more than happy to sign it. 

But the bill she would put forward to congress if there isn't already legislation in the works, is $12"
"7042","1460692438","Hilary is very confusing and obtuse in her answers."
"7043","1460694201","At least she gave a long diatribe on why @12 minimum is a step toward $15.  She couldn't give one reason for why she would oppose breaking up big banks.  Instead she refused to answer the question, repeatedly.  Then she claimed that it wasn't ""fair"" to ask her to release her $200,000  Wall St. speech transcripts because the ""other candidate"" won't.  We all know Bernie has no Wall St speeches but she is pretending otherwise. She will say anything no matter how ridiculous to win. "
"7044","1460723100","You have to be pretty dense to not understand her minimum wage argument. 12 as a baseline and a push for 15 in places that can handle economically. How is that hard?"
"7045","1460721331","Not confusing if you understand how the world works. Same with converting to renewables. You have to make huge changes in phases, otherwise you get very bad side effects.  You can't just jack up minimum wage to 15 everywhere (nor should you as the cost of living in Manhattan and San Francisco is WAY different from places like Alabama and Montana ) immediately without bad consquences."
"7046","1460705894","There was nothing confusing about it at all. She's in favor of a federal, nationwide minimum wage of $12. She's in favor of higher minimum wages in states and cities like New York where the cost of living is higher."
"7047","1460709046","Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"
"7048","1460715245","I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."
"7049","1460720963","The answer seems weird but it makes sense when you consider how hard it is to get any legislation to the desk of the president. I'm sure Hillary's first choice would be a $12 national minimum wage, but if congress were to pass a $15 dollar one I'm sure she wouldn't veto it. It makes perfect sense."
"7050","1460725471","I'm a Bernie supporter, but this is where I agree with Clinton. I believe $12 is a fair minimum wage nationally. Some areas like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco need more. However, I think $15 nationally is too high. Some 15 year old kid in bumfuck Nebraska doesn't need $15 an hour. It could dry up jobs and push automation along faster."
"7051","1460721217","Minimum wage hikes hurt small businesses. Makes sense that a local place out in the countryside wouldn't have to pay as much, even more so since living in the country is cheaper."
"7052","1460729765","So the REAL answer is NO.  She does not support a $15 minimal.  She supports $12, but isn't willing to say that, because that $3 could cost her some votes. "
"7053","1460733003","It's not that she was inarticulate. She was trying to say something technically correct that would still mislead a casual listener to believing she favors a $15/hr minimum wage. She did the same shit with her answer about carbon taxing, and a similar thing with her nonanswer about whether Israel's bombing of Gaza was disproportionate (a fair yes or no question).

 She doesn't even want to say clearly what she believes when it's about a divisive issue because any clear answer is bound to piss off some group of people, so she mealy mouths her answers and tries to have it both ways. It's goddamn infuriating to listen to."
"7054","1460714202","What's so confusing? It was pretty clear: if you support the $15 min wage, then I support the $15 min wage, if you support the $12 min wage, them I support the $12 min wage.

It's very much in line with the rest of her platform: I support whatever gets me more votes."
"7055","1460695682","This is a clear example of HRC displaying her moderate tendencies. She touts herself as a ""progressive that likes to get things done"", but she simply whiffed on her confusing answer. 

Raising the minimum wage to $15 is the one of answers* to the growing welfare problem. If all these people making minimum wage of $7.25/hr and  receiving welfare benefits are making $15/hr, it disqualifies them for many welfare programs.

Edit* changed from the one answer"
"7056","1460732696","I think Hillary would lose a general election. Can you see her stuttering and smirking and backtracking next to someone like Trump? She doesn't have what it takes to win the general against someone like that."
"7057","1460704333","She was always for it... before she negotiated lower, settled for even less, and blamed someone else for its failure."
"7058","1460703474","I'm for whatever will get me nominated."
"7059","1460704518","That looks Bernie gives her at 2:20 with the crowd booing."
"7060","1460701184","I couldn't believe that she was doubling down on the Fight for 15."
"7061","1460703907","She supports a $15 minimum wage in some high cost cities and a lower minimum wage in more rural areas. In any event, she thinks the federal minimum wage should be raised to $12. And if Democrats can somehow get higher than $12 through Congress, she'll happily sign it.

It's only confusing if you're sorta dumb."

&gt;    The evidence suggests that if there is police racial bias in arrests it is negligible. Victim and witness surveys show that police arrest violent criminals in close proportion to the rates at which criminals of different races commit violent crimes.

&gt;    There are dramatic race differences in crime rates. Asians have the lowest rates, followed by whites, and then Hispanics. Blacks have notably high crime rates. This pattern holds true for virtually all crime categories and for virtually all age groups.

&gt;    In 2013, a black was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder, and 12 times more likely to murder someone of another race than to be murdered by someone of another race.

&gt;    In 2013, of the approximately 660,000 crimes of interracial violence that involved blacks and whites, blacks were the perpetrators 85 percent of the time. This meant a black person was 27 times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. A Hispanic was eight times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa.

&gt;    In 2014 in New York City, a black was 31 times more likely than a white to be arrested for murder, and a Hispanic was 12.4 times more likely. For the crime of “shooting” — defined as firing a bullet that hits someone — a black was 98.4 times more likely than a white to be arrested, and a Hispanic was 23.6 times more likely.

&gt;    If New York City were all white, the murder rate would drop by 91 percent, the robbery rate by 81 percent, and the shootings rate by 97 percent.

&gt;    In an all-white Chicago, murder would decline 90 percent, rape by 81 percent, and robbery by 90 percent.

&gt;    In 2015, a black person was 2.45 times more likely than a white person to be shot and killed by the police. A Hispanic person was 1.21 times more likely. These figures are well within what would be expected given race differences in crime rates and likelihood to resist arrest.

&gt;    In 2015, police killings of blacks accounted for approximately 4 percent of homicides of blacks. Police killings of unarmed blacks accounted for approximately 0.6 percent of homicides of blacks. The overwhelming majority of black homicide victims (93 percent from 1980 to 2008) were killed by blacks.

&gt;    Both violent and non-violent crime has been declining in the United States since a high in 1993. 2015 saw a disturbing rise in murder in major American cities that some observers associated with “depolicing” in response to intense media and public scrutiny of police activity.

"7063","1460826386","There is an argument to be made that the new crime wave didn't appear *because* we began applying stricter incarceration and police protocols, saying we should scrap them because the crime rate went down is like saying you don't need river levees because you haven't had any floods. Violent crime peaked in the late 80's and early 90's, in response there were reforms made to lengthen prison sentences and increase police presence in high crime areas.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro–stupid shit?’ ”The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit.

The only way these rules will ever change is to know them, follow them, and then vote for candidates who promote something simpler, something more democratic, something more open. The only way voting will *ever* become a national holiday, is if enough voters without a national holiday demand one. Pointing out the flaws isn't enough, nor was it ever enough.

Even further, even Jesus was expected by the Jews to come set up a physical kingdom and he said that wasn't the point.

The obstinate stupidity of this man, combined with self righteous indignity, can only lead to disaster. This is a secular country, that was the main attraction early on, even before we called it America. It was a place to escape persecution for being different. Quakers, shakers, puritans, etc. Everyone that was not part of the main church ruled by the king of wherever, was in danger until they escaped their homelands and got here. Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country. Our founders wanted the soldier's, and the king's taxes, out. It was not about establishing a Christian nation. They drank, they whored, they swore. They were men. Normal men.

He's rather moderate actually, a presidency with him in office would be pretty uneventful, congress won't let the wall thing get passed, and he'll be out in 4 years. Ted Cruz however scares me shitless. It would be a step backwards to elect him. We'd have more religious tension discrimination than we already do. Even as a conservative leaning voter, i would never vote for Cruz. I'm economically/fiscally conservative but socially liberal. And Ted Cruz is the exact opposite. He's like Hillary Clinton except he wants to carpet bomb places is Iraq, ban gay marriage &amp;amp; abortion. Won't believe a word of climate change and is too deluded by his religion to be a rationale leader for the majority. And also he's the zodiac killer. "

Presidents come and go. But any particular supreme court can be around for 30 years.

If we let a republican president replace Scalia and Ginsberg, we can look forward to a reversal of Roe v Wade, reversal of gay marriage, overturn of the ACA, final destruction of unions and indivduals' rights to due process, and supremacy of business above all to an irreversible level."

Yeah sure Trump has said some wacky things, but I think a lot of it is exaggerated pandering.  I'm sure he understands that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress aren't exactly his biggest supporters so he would have to somehow appeal to both in order to get anything done.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

Neither should Sanders. He claims that his wife handles the taxes, and that is good and fine, but if that's true there is no reason why she can't fly to Vermont grab em' and fly back. The wait to get them has caused this mess and he could've easily put it to bed. "

I don't see how this trend can stop until production is a thing of the past here and all we have is government jobs, service and hospitality, and the financial sector for job options. We can't force other countries to raise their standard of living so Americans will invariably have to compete for labor with people making less than a dollar an hour. 

Seriously, a book can be written on all of the problems of globalization and these free trade agreements. But with the technology of today how can it be stopped? The rest of the world is going to have to catch up with the US before we see jobs stop leaving. Tariffs seem like the only known option, and that's a crude instrument at best. If they were set high enough to offset the benefits of leaving then perhaps that would help. America is still an attractive consumer market.

Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said. Francis recently helped negotiate a historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations that has led to restored diplomatic ties between the countries."

Everyone agrees that businesses and corporations need to be managed but, apparently, that need disappears when it comes to capitalism on the national or global scale.

The only question here is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs they impose.

&gt;There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.

"7729","1460817578","[Link](https://www.scribd.com/doc/308299698/Cavanaugh-v-Bartelt) to the case.  

In looking up this case, it appears that the plaintiff, Stephen W. Cavanaugh, brought this case as pro se plaintiff meaning he had no legal representation.  This case, in my opinion, was decided incorrectly and with adequate counsel should be reversed on appeal and allowed to progress.  The Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to 10(b)(6).

While I couldn't read the Complaint, it appears that Cavanaugh sued prison officials pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages because he was denied (1) access to wear religious clothing; (2) ability to congregate for weekly worship services and classes; and (3) right to receive communion.  The prison officials denied his requests because they concluded that ""FSMism was a parody religion.""

The Court goes through a lengthy historical detail regarding evolution and briefly discusses the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  While I do not have access to the motion to dismiss, I imagine the arguments made within are parroted in this decision in whole.  It ultimately holds that the religion is in fact a parody before analyzing the legal arguments.

Cavanaugh's claims: (1) Violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of religion of the US Constitution; (2) Article I, §4 of the Nebraska Constitution; (3) Equal Protection provisions of the US Constitution; and (4) Article I, §3 of the Nebraska Constitution.  The Court construed the Complaint as raising a claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) U.S.C. §2000cc.

The Court first analyzed RLUIPA which requires protection against government action when the government's conduct imposes (1) a substantial burden (2) on a religious exercise.  In analyzing the ""religious exercise,"" the Court held that RLUIPA may only be raised to protect sincere religious beliefs and not secular ways of life.  The Court essentially rules that FSMism is not a religion but a parody, and equates the religious  texts to that of Jonathan Swift's ""Modest Proposal"" which advocates cannibalism.  Ruling that FSMism is not a religion, it is not awarded protection under RLUIPA.

There is no cause of action for money damages under RLUIPA against state officials acting in their official capacities, so the claim is barred by sovereign immunity.  Thus the Court held that Cavanaugh failed to state a claim for relief, so his claim for injunctive relief was dismissed.

His First Amendment claim is dismissed because, as a pro se claimant, he failed to state an alleged injury-- i.e. argue that he was substantially burdened and required to alter his behavior. 

His Equal Protection claim is dismissed essentially because the Court ruled that the officials ""considered Cavanaugh's request in good faith and concluded, reasonably, that FSMism was satirical and required no accommodation.""

His state claims were dismissed because they offered the same protections as their federal counterparts.

The plaintiff was offered no leave to amend his Complaint, and the Order was final. 

EDIT: It is worth noting that the IRS has approved the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster tax exempt status 501(C)3.

Meanwhile, his support of small gun manufacturers in the U.S. drew praise from the National Rifle Association in March.

FFS.

MSM has been incredibly disingenuous on this issue. Sanders is clearly against allowing military style weapons being sold to civilians as well as in favour of holding makers/sellers liable for manufacturer's defects and wrongful selling practices. He is entirely against immunity under these circumstances but they are taking the part where he stipulates that outside of these circumstances you should *not* be able to sue and presenting it as if he's still saying that you shouldn't be able to sue at all. Nothing regarding Sanders' stance on this issue ever changed.

[Source:](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-gun-policy/)

&gt; Manufacturer Liability: Gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the misuse of their products, just as any other industry isn’t held accountable for how end-consumers use their products.

&gt; Bernie believes that gun control is largely a state issue because attitudes and actions with regards to firearms differ greatly between rural and urban communities. Nevertheless, Bernie believes there are situations where the federal government should intervene. **He voted in favor of requiring background checks to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of felons and the mentally ill, passing a federal ban on assault weapons, and closing loopholes which allows private sellers at gun shows and on the internet to sell to individuals without background checks.**

&gt; To what extent does Bernie believe that gun regulation should be a federal issue?

&gt; Bernie has voted in favor of a nationwide ban on assault weapons, a nationwide ban on high-capacity magazines of over ten rounds, and nationwide expanded background checks that address unsafe loopholes.

With respect to the Sandy Hook lawsuit, [he supports it:] (http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/14/politics/transcript-democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/)

&gt; BLITZER: So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?

&gt; SANDERS: No, I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. **They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.**

He supports it based on this [premise] (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36050659)

&gt; The suit argues that the semi-automatic rifle used in the school shooting is a military weapon and should not have been sold to civilians.

...which is exactly in line with what his stance has always been with respect to assault weapons.

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "

A basic tenet is the law of diminishing returns meaning your second dollar should be harder to earn than your first and your third harder than your second.

It grows by ever-expanding debt, on the assumption of limitless growth, that will always be large enough to repay past debts, to keep the whole game credible.  But that's no longer working.  Instead, we get bubbles and busts.  Real wealth has stagnated.  What to do? Assume that global warming is real, and very threatening.  It does not present market signals that promote survival.  What's needed is a global-political re-orientation to direct resources for a sustainable future.  For that future to be worth living in, it must involve people in decision-making, and as much local control as possible.  That's where all this must go, or we can just give up the fight.

Francis invited Sanders to the stage and microphone of the Vatican immediately prior to a critically important primary because he too is selling the product, and indeed he is the leading marketer behind the new packaging design. The program is being taken up now by others involved in the sales effort.

I doubt it will work. Buyers are not so stupid they will be tricked by a shiny new package on a failed old product, not many of them, not for long. There being no consumer protection agency to regulate false political advertising, though, the marketing can go forward."

She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

He kept getting changes, amendments, and very large pieces of legislation ... his name was often not on those pieces of legislation.

He was an effective legislator - in fact, one of the most effective legislators, because the more you work behind the scenes and don't try to push yourself out there and don't try to get the limelight, the more effective you can be, which, ironically, invites the complaint from some people that he was ineffective because he was not in the limelight.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.

But the anti immigrant rhetoric, women issues and childish debate antics are a big turn off. He is a business man. He knows how important immigrant labor (at both ends of the wage spectrum - low wage and high wage) is for GDP growth. Anyone telling you otherwise is just lying. Low end immigrant labor is the reason for sub 1% food inflation for the past 20+ years. All you compassionate conservatives out there - I hope you say a little prayer for the manual labor that went into your 'immigrant labor subsidised' plate of food - every meal every day. High wage immigrant labor keeps social security solvent (until 2034 atleast). Their taxes is what keeps the boomer SS checks from bouncing. Not to mention the growth in GDP from tech growth. (Hello Brin of Google). If you are even questioning the value add from either end of the wage spectrum - you are an illiterate moron.


If you are a boomer and haven't saved up much for retirement - thank the immigrants who pay your social security and keep the food costs below inflation.

"8232","1460667359","&gt;Using the salary data supplied by the Clinton campaign, we looked at median and average salaries for men and women in Clinton’s office year by year and found relatively minor differences. In five out of the seven years, the median salaries were slightly lower for women without Clinton’s salary included. But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

"8246","1460690407","Politicians should be held to a high level of scrutiny, but journalists have a responsibility to do their homework. At best this article is sloppy reporting perpetuating a trope of HRC that is in my opinion unfair. 

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.
