Bernie really wants to tackle green energy and by tomorrow. He'd probably ask for some green tech from Martian green men if he had the chance.

"120",1460728258,"*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton’s decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. ","Reddit"

But I decided last night, while she dodged this question multiple times, that maybe it's something else. 

Maybe those transcripts were stored on her private server along with the rest of the Clinton Foundation's documents. Maybe she can't release then because they're currently part of the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which is just one of the investigations currently underway.

We are still dealing with Republicans deciding not to work with Democrats because they lost the election.  I really do not feel energized to see a candidate who only became a Democrat, so he could get the democrat money to run for President and who will not only be unable to work with Republicans but also unwilling to work with many democrats.

Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change.

Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-05-20/news/9102270272_1_nra-officials-brady-bill-powerful-gun).)

He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so.

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro–stupid shit?’ ”The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit. (Clinton quickly apologized to Obama for her comments, and a Clinton spokesman announced that the two would “hug it out” on Martha’s Vineyard when they crossed paths there later.)**

Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said.

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

"645",1460713913,"Because people are tired of protests that are nothing more than attention grabbing with no actual plan beyond ""look at me!""

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. ","Reddit"

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.

"893",1460667359,"&gt;Using the salary data supplied by the Clinton campaign, we looked at median and average salaries for men and women in Clinton’s office year by year and found relatively minor differences. In five out of the seven years, the median salaries were slightly lower for women without Clinton’s salary included. But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.

"1088",1460711369,"Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues.","Reddit"

"1495",1460652034,"I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;In my relatively short career on Wall Street, I’ve watched us lurch from crisis to crisis – from the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, the dot-com bubble, post-9/11 – without exactly learning our lesson.”

&gt;After all that, Black came to the conclusion that “capitalism works better if we don’t have a class of banks who take all the reward and none of the risk.” And like Ryan, he thinks the fallout of that disparity is written all over New York city.

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679).

"1765",1460646328,"&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;&gt;    a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

Joel Gehrke reports for the Examiner: ""Some Senate Republicans might also be drawn to the bill by the inclusion of 'a mandatory sentencing enhancement for fentanyl crimes,' an addition that could be particular appealing to Sen. Kelly Ayotte, whose home state of New Hampshire is struggling to contain a heroin epidemic.""

&gt;[...]

&gt;In the 1990s, doctors opened up access to opioid painkillers, getting many patients hooked on the drugs. So when officials pulled back access to painkillers, many addicted users didn't just quit the drug; they moved to another opioid, heroin. And now, there are signs that some opioid users are moving on to an opioid that's more powerful and potentially cheaper than painkillers or heroin, fentanyl. And that's all causing more overdose deaths. (For more on the opioid epidemic, check out Vox's explainer.)

&gt;The criminal justice reform bill's solution to this epidemic? A harsher punishment. And that means more nonviolent drug offenders will end up behind bars for long periods of time — particularly for fentanyl.

To go out of the country for almost two days just a few days before the NY primary is dumbfounding, especially when Bernie has shown multiple times that the more time he spends campaigning in a state before the voters vote, the better he ends up doing. Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do.

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.

"4670",1460660064,"&gt; Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job.

A woman I met at a car wash noticed my Sanders sticker and came up to talk to me.   She was in her mid 60s and showed me an old timey photo of her and her husband marching for women's rights in the 60s, suggesting that this was the moment when it all paid off -- Hillary (a woman) should be our next president.

When I asked her what she didn't like about Bernie, she said:

1. He was on welfare until age 40
2. Won't be able to push legislation through
3. He only passed 3 pieces of legislation in his time as senator

"4701",1460679229,"Jackson was a ~~badass~~ fucking insane person:

&gt;The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

&gt;The Trans-Pacific Partnership Would Undermine 
Internet Freedom
Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning.","Reddit"

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat.

"5119",1460647105,"As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result.","Reddit"

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily.

"5395",1460615853,"Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else.","Reddit"

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”

"5565",1460625392,"So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else.","Reddit"

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

&gt; Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, “so messed up”. 

How nuanced.

Mainly the utility poles, trenches and limited usable frequencies that all traverse public space to connect us all together.  It is very similar to our interstates and roadways.  Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

"6135",1460607809,"Okay. It is good as the whole build-up to it is ""Save the children!"". But here's why it is not good in the long run. It costs $10,000 just to apply to be a grower. Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

"6518",1460641299,"Outsourced i can understand, and get behind. Automated however, will be difficult to stop and hard to justify against. 

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!","Reddit"

There are a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters who have intelligent and nuanced views on politics, and an understanding of the bigger picture at play.

"6767",1460557521,"&gt; There are problems with the broader story Sanders tells. His ongoing insistence that Obama-era reforms were woefully insufficient — and his explanation for it, i.e., that Dems remain in thrall to plutocratic money and failed to rally the grassroots to break GOP opposition — are overly simplistic, give those achievements short shrift, **and don’t fully reckon with our system’s structural realities.**

This is the problem with WaPo and other MSM outlets today. It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd. It's the constant defeatism and uninspiring approval of the truly meager progress being made that shifts focus away from the biggest problems in today's political landscape, which *are* structural and pervasive, not specific and discrete. How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

The rise of both Sanders *and* Trump is showing us that people are *not* happy with status quo politics or politicians. That the majority of people want *drastic* change, not faux pragmatism that is really leading us nowhere fast.

&gt; Among large, profitable entities, 19.5 percent paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2012, said the report, which came at the behest of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, whose campaign circulated the study.

&gt; That $1.8 billion in relief from Goldman that's supposed to help homeowners in distress? Miller says that in these cases, the terms are kept vague, and Goldman can use that money to do things that are in its best interest anyway, like writing off debt that's obviously not going to be repaid, demolish foreclosed upon houses, and modify mortgages that are in distress.

&gt;""It would be like me agreeing to be right handed all day today or to wake up tomorrow morning and have coffee,"" Miller says of the settlement agreements. ""Those things are going to happen anyway.""

&gt;He also pointed to something critics have called the ""bullshit-to-cash ratio"" as one indicator of how little the penalty will affect a giant like Goldman. Basically, it's important to note that only about $3 billion of the $5 billion will be paid out in cash. On the other hand, about half is tax-deductible and will be placed on the backs of taxpayers––even though the median American family lost about 40 percent of their wealth during the worst stretch of the crisis.

&gt;What's more, the New York Times notes that after incentives and tax credits, Goldman can chop about a billion dollars off the total penalty. According to a chart attached to the settlement, for every dollar Goldman puts into community investment in New York, they get a $2 tax credit.","Reddit"

"7155",1460564042,"One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

If anything, he ran to the *right* of Hillary on some issues, such as his rejection of the individual mandate.

The reason why his 7 state win streak hasn't accounted to a huge change in the race is most of those states are smaller states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming) And the system is rarely a winner take all, and winning by a huge margin in a state worth 20 to 30 delegates isn't worth as much by winning a state worth 300 by the same margin or even a much closer one.  For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

"7284",1460510197,"I have been stalking this election as an outside observer to the US and it really is fascinating to me. I am utterly bemused by the lack of critical analysis of a range of sources and the ability for everyday Americans to draw their own informed and fully justified conclusion.


I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

I am reminded of Sarah Palin's famous quote; ""*FRUIT FLIES!*""","Reddit"
"7403",1460675176,"Here is the abstract:

&gt;This interdisciplinary research project will advance basic understanding of how tax compliance behavior emerges by focusing on how perceptions of risk and tax fairness form, how these perceptions spread through a social network, and the interplay caused by the complex feedback loops among individual behaviors and population-level outcomes. The project also will address how audit, penalty, and taxation policies, and changes in those policies, influence perceptions and ultimately reduce tax evasion. The project will provide new insights regarding how tax compliance behavior is modified by the perceived aggregated compliance and on how behavior and the perceived aggregated compliance depend on social network structure over which perceptions of taxation spreads. The project will demonstrate the utility of the use of agent-based modeling for research on interactions between individuals and governments as well as how data from the American Life Panel collected by Rand Corporation can be employed to address problems like this. The analysis also will have practical utility, because it will shed light on why certain countries with high taxation levels, such as Scandinavian nations, can maintain high levels of tax compliance while other countries with lower taxation levels may have high levels of tax evasion as is the case in Greece and Italy. Project findings therefore should help nations like the United States reduce the occurrence of tax evasion.

&gt;Income tax evasion is a problem that poses considerable challenges for tax authorities and governments at the local, state, and federal levels. Its causes and implications are both economic and social. The role of tax evasion-related perceptions and how social networks influence those perceptions remain poorly understood, however. The investigators will build an agent-based computational simulation model of income tax evasion. Within the simulation, the compliance behavior of individuals will change through an adaptation process based on their past experiences with audits and tax evasion penalties, their perception of the fairness in taxation rates, and social interactions with people in their social networks. In conjunction, the investigators will conduct a national survey on the perceptions of tax fairness. The survey will gather individual-level data that will inform the simulation model's behavioral mechanisms. These mechanisms influence the propensity to evade, and the survey provides an empirical basis for choosing model-specific parameter values. Model assumptions will further be informed using sensitivity analyses. The simulation model will be validated and calibrated to reproduce U.S. national levels of income tax compliance for different tax brackets. In addition to the U.S., the model also will be calibrated using data sets and compliance levels for Greece and Denmark. Once calibrated, the model will be used to understand how tax evasion behaviors evolve differently depending on various starting assumptions, such as how social networks are structured or what fiscal policies are in place and the conditions for the system to produce tipping point dynamics. The model then will be used to identify fiscal policies that are most effective in minimize tax evasion and recovering compliance. The investigators will employ robust decision making, a method for improving policy decision making, to rank policies based both on their potential performance, as well as how robust this performance is to the key sources of uncertainty. This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.

Of course the dimwitted among us will rush to say ""of course we know why people cheat on their taxes - they don't want to pay money.""  But that is a pretty dumb answer.  Nobody likes paying their taxes, but most of us still pay them, so it is not a very good explanation.  ","Reddit"

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me. I remember how embarrassed I was when I got turned down from a job after being interviewed and hired and then my background check came back and they said my credit was worrisome so they didn't hire me, saying they would be happy to talk to me again when I resolved it all.

"7919",1460556375,"&gt;So why hasn't return-free filing happened yet? The short answer is lobbying, and in particular lobbying by companies like Intuit. In 2013, ProPublica's Liz Day wrote an incredible exposé on just how hard Intuit has lobbied to stop return-free filing from becoming a reality:

&gt;&gt;[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

&gt;&gt;Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

This is the problem.  [Campaign finance is the meta issue; it encompasses all others because every legislative battle today, comes down to money.](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/hillary-clintons-plan-to-reform-campaign-finance-i.html)","Reddit"
"7920",1460553305,"&gt;The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it's been doing for years.

&gt;Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.

&gt;Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new ""return-free"" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like. Warren isn't the first person to propose this. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) both have similar bills this Congress.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

Make filing an amendment in this case cost a little money to discourage procrastination in those who do have changes to make.

"8228",1460732583,"Sanders' supporters won't likely listen to criticisms of him.  Unfortunately, this article is right on.  Now, if Sanders' purpose is to fuel his supporters, he more or less was successful at that.  He did what his supporters more or less expected him to do.  But to voters on the fence, his manner came off as being rude and probably condescending.  A lot of snarky remarks and finger pointing won't be perceived positively (let alone directed at a woman) by objective undecided voters.

To me, last night Sanders won when he challenged Clinton to release the transcripts.  She was clearly evasive.  But his sarcastic remarks were a turn off.  Clinton won in portraying herself was someone who could get things done.  Two particular points she made were convincing: one is about the minimum wage (she would sign a $15 minimum wave if the bill was on her desk, but to get there, you couldn't do it in one step) and fracking (her explanation how foreign countries have go to through fracking first before getting to green energy was convincing).

On Israel and Palestinian, I found Sanders' statements very eloquent (he can't explain his position better than that).  Unfortunately, the entire tone came off as not being supportive of Israel as Clinton.  It would win the Palestinian vote in NY.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.

Overall, Sanders' supporters will vote for him. Clinton's supporters will vote for her.  For those people on the edge, I think Clinton did a little better.  I thought Clinton's closing remarks were very effective.  She was very appealing to NYers who voted her to the Senate.  She was asking them and talking to them directly.

&gt;CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process:
“Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturday’s 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.”

- average per-quarter donation
- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

"8295",1460558032,"Goldman admitted to fraud, which largely contributed to the destruction of our economy.

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

&gt;Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

&gt;Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

&gt;Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

&gt;Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

&gt;Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel Transaction. The 2014 effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership prior to the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

&gt;Bertha Oliva compared the current situation to the early 1980s, when the CIA funded, armed, and trained Honduran government death squads that murdered hundreds of opposition activists.

and:
&gt;“When we first began in 1982, we faced death squads,” said Oliva, also speaking through a translator. “Now, it’s like going back to the past. We know there are death squads in Honduras.”

also:
&gt;The coup was accompanied by a huge rise in political violence. By 2012, state security forces had assassinated more than 300 people, and 34 members of the opposition and 13 journalists had disappeared, according to data compiled by Honduran human rights organizations. The political assassinations added to the emboldened violence from gangs and drug traffickers, making Honduras one of the most dangerous countries in the world. In 2012, Reuters reported that it had the highest murder rate of any country.

&gt;Although the murder rate has since declined, political violence in Honduras has continued. Since the end of 2012, at least 22 prominent environmental activists have been killed, according to Global Witness.

"8583",1460640210,"&gt;But I was struck, in our conversation, by the frequency with which Carter framed today's world within those same dynamics that had preoccupied his early career: great power rivalries, nuclear weapons, and the power of deterrence to keep the world in line.

&gt;It's not that he's unconcerned with terrorism or rogue states, both of which he discussed at length. But he clearly drew from his experiences in the 1980s and '90s an acute sensitivity to the world-shaking stakes of great power rivalries, and a firm belief in the role that deterrence and nuclear weapons still play.

&gt;Carter described a world where not just American power but also global peace and stability will be increasingly challenged by other powers. He returned over and over to the same answer to this problem: the power of deterrence, backed up by overwhelming American superiority and, ultimately, by nuclear weapons.

&gt;But deterrence works on decades-old understandings of warfare that are, today, rapidly changing. As countries develop new tools and techniques of war, Carter warned that deterrence, the foundation on which American power and global stability are built, needs to change as well.

&gt;That is not a challenge that grabs as many headlines as terrorism or rogue states. But the stakes — the international order as know it, 70 years of peace between the major powers, and the thousands of nuclear warheads backing it up — could not be higher.

The pollutants generated from the mass manufacture of solar panels can also be pretty nasty and harmful to the environment, though it's getting better all the time. 

Additionally, the fundamental piece missing from renewables is you can't control them to work when you want.  In a 100% renewable generation profile, where will your power come from in the middle of the night when the wind isn't blowing. You can't make it blow, and can't make the sun shine.

Therefore, whatever the cost of wind is, it is almost entirely in addition to the cost of fossil fuel power generation.

"8669",1460473907,"There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

This whole scheme - including this very article - seems geared toward privatizing education via ""charter schools"" - basically private schools using public dollars, the holy grail of crony capitalism. ","Reddit"

http://www.newsday.com/opinion/hillary-clinton-at-newsday-long-island-transcript-1.11680010

Newsday's website is subscription only, but I will post as much as I think I safely can under the doctrine of fair use:

&gt;Filler: So, New York and Long Island don't just lead the country in property taxes, that's not our only calling card. We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

&gt;Clinton: Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-à-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime. It was very upsetting to everybody.

&gt;Filler:So you wouldn't say don't do it, you would say do it right.

&gt;Clinton:Do it right. Do it right and I would say I think we need better and fewer tests that are used for what tests should be used for, first and foremost as to how to improve the educational outcomes for individual children, for classes of children, and for schools of children.

&gt;Filler: Should they be used at all to determine whether teachers are being successful?

&gt;Clinton: I think given the state of where testing is right now, I don't think they're good enough to make that determination.","Reddit"

This may actually be one of the first times I've seen the national testing agenda cast as sound progressive policy.

&gt;I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001, and continue to oppose the bill's reliance on ***high-stakes standardized testing*** to direct draconian interventions. In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on ***standardized testing***, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.

"8686",1460507334,"It is for all of these reasons stated below that in Europe, they have different levels of high school; tracking not only classes but entire schools. The reality is that you can't teach students that have such a range of ability level. It is just as ridiculous to expect a low achieving students to be able to do the same as a high achieving student ( or intelligent, a word you may never use in the educational system as eveeybody is the same apparently) as it is to expect a 5ft 60lbs girl to wrestle a 6ft 200lbs guy and be competitive. People are limited by their abilities; a good teacher, like a sports coach may have a 10% impact but it can't make a weak student strong. It is ridiculous to hold teachers or schools  accountable for the grades of their students. At our school, we have a large number of immigrants who barely speak english. Their score count the same as those of native speakers. It is all part of the American notion that everybody can achieve anything as long as they work hard. This is high,y naive: students can reach the goals they set for themselves, based on their interests and ability by working hard.
The downside of the European system is that it creates a class society where people at a young age are labeled and start acting and oerforming accordingly. Also, the level of the teachers at the lower level schools is lower because frankly most teachers don't want to work there, because of the behavioral issues. The other downside is that it is negatively biased towards boys, who tend to be behind in development and organizational skills, compared to their female peers. I know tons of freshmen that would have been put in the lower level schools because they can't even bring a pencil with them, who turned out responsible and dilligent seniors a few years later.

&gt; Bunnatine (Bunny) H. Greenhouse is a former chief contracting officer Senior Executive Service (Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. On June 27, 2005, she testified to a Congressional panel, alleging specific instances of waste, fraud, and other abuses and irregularities by Halliburton with regard to its operations in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. She described one of the Halliburton contracts (secret, no-bid contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR)—a subsidiary of Halliburton) as ""the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career"".[1]

&gt; A long-time government employee, Greenhouse was hired by Lieutenant General Joe Ballard in 1997 to oversee contracts at the Army Corps of Engineers. After Ballard retired in 2000, Greenhouse's performance reviews, which had been exemplary throughout her public career, suddenly soured. Greenhouse filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint alleging race and gender discrimination, which her attorney states has never been investigated. In August 2005, she was demoted in what her lawyer called an ""obvious reprisal"" for her revelations about the Halliburton contracts.[2][3]

"8857",1460484621,"It's pretty rare for any Democrat [politicians] to discuss firearms publicly and not lie. Some do it because they simply parrot the Democrat propaganda. Others, like Clinton, do it because they knowingly push propaganda to facilitate their idealogical agenda.

The real crime is that anyone listens to anything any Democrat has to say on firearms and firearms policy. As a matter of course, the standard assumption is that everything they say is dishonest or at best a half-truth. Sadly, this is not a hyperbolic statement or exaggeration in any way. Which is especially frustrating because there are so many very knowledgeable people who know law, Constitution, research studies, and history, who can accurately discuss public policy and even societal root causes. Heck, a huge number of laymen know the subject matter far, far better than most Democrats attempting to make public policy and law. Take time to ponder that.

To give you an idea of how completely backwards political arena is on firearms, consider the following. When people want expert opinion, they go to experts. When Democrats want expert opinion on firearms and policy, they go to politicians. Which is painfully obvious why, as the experts contradict just about everything Democrat politicians have to say on the subject. Which brings us full circle to my opening sentence.

"8858",1460477183,"So Vermont definitely has issues with guns leaving their state illegally. This wasn't a very strong attack because it doesn't apply to New York in the same numbers. But Vermont is *per-capita* responsible for the most guns recovered in other states in general. 

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-vermont-guns-responsible-for-new-york-violence/

&gt;Her statistics come from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issued a report in 2013 saying **Vermont was in fact, adjusted for population, the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states.** That year, 23.5 guns per 100,000 residents, or a total of 147, were recovered in crimes committed outside of Vermont. The next-highest per capita state was New Hampshire, with 22.3 guns per 100,000 residents.

&gt;An ATF report from 2014 put Vermont in the top 15 states whose guns were recovered in New York. Still, it's worth noting that guns from Vermont are just a tiny fraction of the overall number of out-of-state guns recovered there: that year, Vermont's guns were 55 of the total 4,585 out-of-state guns. In the same year Georgia was the source for 386 out-of-state guns and 395 were traced to Virginia.

Here is her quote- ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest **per capita** number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""

So she was wrong about the New York part. But it is true that per- capita, Vermont is the number one source of guns recovered in other states. Which doesn't sound good, but obviously there aren't very many people in Vermont. ","Reddit"

As it turns out, *New York* is the state's leading source of illegal guns.

If anything, giving politicians and the democratic party MORE money from such groups is exacerbating an already existing problem. They will be knocking on doors for favors once elections are done.

&gt;The reality is that Clinton’s plan would barely scratch the surface of the issue. Her proposals are aimed at Citizens United, but as we established, that’s a small piece to a much larger problem. If the Democratic front-runner got her way, corporations would have to disclose their political donations. However, the heart of the matter is far more complex. Her plan doesn’t change that money is speech, nor does it involve tightening the rules of what constitutes “social welfare.” It does not do anything towards regulating 501c4 nonprofits, which would still be able to hide their donors. “Issue advocacy” would still be largely unchecked. Like in the example I gave above, wealthy individuals like the Koch Brothers, who are corporate interests, would still be able to run political “issue” ads through nonprofits with benign names, hiding their identities while pushing a corporate agenda. These individuals would not have to disclose their spending because they are not corporations, nor are they necessarily spending on politics.","Reddit"

Shareholders like this because it increases the value of the company and boosts their share value (which gets taxed when they sell).

Okay... well my bottom line took quite a hit since I got a mortgage 3 years ago, so why am I paying taxes? How do I go about incorporating my household?

I don't understand where these arbitrary differences and categories come from. I fully understand that much of that is simply my ignorance of the complicated laws and regulations that govern this stuff, but at the end of the day I'm not sure that can account for the grave injustice our tax system currently delivers to the average person in this country.

I'm sure there's some fancy-pants economists' answer as to why business need to be treated specially, but I'm not sure I care. ""Society needs these businesses to keep the economy alive."" Okay, and society needs middle class people to be able to afford to live too, so why do we see a higher value in the well-being of a corporation than we do in the well-being of a household? (Excepting the obvious increased impact of the failure of a corporation when compared to personal bankruptcy. My claim here is that what we have today is not valued proportionately.)

Businesses don't need help. They live and die by demand. If there is demand and they go bankrupt then they are mismanaging their business. Households need help, households need support. The demand for stable households is far more abstract than the instant gratification of being able to spend $10.00 on an App in Apple's store so they can take $3.33 of that, and so that the developer who actually made the fucking thing might get a penny. Millions (Billions?) of people wanted Apple to make an phone that integrated into all of Apple's other services. How many people asked me to start a family? How many would if we could actually appreciate the consequences of that choice; if it were as simple as the last line on the page being red or black?

I'm relatively well off. My combined household income is over 100k and we've got about 230k in debt (Mortgage and car) and I'm young-ish still, I think. My wife and are are happy because happy is relative, and a lot of people we know are still living with their parents, but every day my wife has to leave our daughter and go to work we feel like slaves to a system in which we have no stake or voice.

""Instead of condemning the figures behind the uprising, suspending support to the illegitimate government of Zelaya’s successor, Roberto Micheletti, and demanding a restoration of the democratically elected Zelaya, Secretary Clinton decided to move on. In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region “to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.” The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya’s ouster.""

Sorry but when you are a president you are supposed to be the leader and others should follow you and not the other way around. This is something I miss in Hillary.

Another trait of a good leader is taking the blame when it is yours to take and not blame somebody else for the mistakes you made! Yesterday in debate you could clearly see she that she doesn't understand this (she solely blamed Obama for some mistakes she was as much responsible for.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

Single payer healthcare
Marijuana decriminalization
Ending the drug war
Breaking up the big banks
Israel commits disproportionate violence and we should treat both sides with respect 
Campaign contribution corrupt politicians
Overthrowing regimes in ME and Latin America has lead to mass instability in these regions
Our defense budget is too high
College education should be heavily subsidized by the government
15 minimum wage
Spoken out against NSA surveillance and warrentless data collection
Condemned large corporations for not paying taxes
Gone against free trade policies
Talking about the consequences and mistakes of the Iraq war
Talking about mass incarceration and criminal justice reform

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window. I highly doubt that a candidate like Clinton will be elected again, but who knows

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.

"10645",1460736221,"May I ask what the actual justification of a $15 min. wage is? I don't mean whether we should raise the minimum wage, and I agree we should, but what rationale is being used to come up with a specific $15 target at the national level? Do those that support it actually know what the impact would be, or is the assumption simply that however many min. wage earners we have will be the same number who benefit from the min. wage increase? 

If your assumption is the latter, that every min. wage worker will benefit from an increase in the min. wage to $15, might I simply suggest you're making a rather strong assumption. And I don't even necessarily mean with respect to job losses, but with respect to job availability. Raising the min. wage will be no problem for the big boys. Your Wal-marts, Targets, Home Depots etc... will have no problem paying the higher min. wage. Aren't you at least a bit curious why Wal-mart has suddenly grown warm to the idea of an increase? Could it possibly have something to do with the fact that they now have so much market share that paltry increases in costs won't actually result in any decreases in profits, but will likely increase prices at Wal-mart, at least partially offsetting the assumed benefit flowing to min. wage workers after the increase (who shop at Wal-mart already). 

An increase in the minimum wage to $15 nationally would drill many small-to-medium businesses into the ground, after which we'll only have inefficient oligopolists to buy goods from, and then eventually only even more inefficient monopolists. If you care about consumers, then you should be advocating for policies that increase competition in markets. Now again, I support modest increases in the min. wage, handled at the city/state level, as these min. wages will better reflect the highly varied regional economic differences in the U.S. But, we should be wary of large bumps in the min. wage, because at the very least it puts small-to-medium businesses at an even larger cost disadvantage to large firms than they already have. Its very similar to how we handle environmental policy. By having across the board regulations, we put small businesses at a disadvantage by ignoring their cost disadvantage, with the end result being more market power driven to large firms.

We should advocate for policies that induce businesses to pay their low-income employees more while still having a min. wage set at some morally comfortable standard of living. But everything is a trade-off, not the least of which is the efficiency/equity trade off in our macroeconomy. So, while we may feel good about supporting a $15 min. wage because we believe it will benefit all min. wage workers, the outcome isn't at all so clear cut. Most research on min. wage shows that modest increases create modest but negligible job losses. This research doesn't come from right-wingers who hate the min. wage, but objective researchers seeking the TRUE impact of increasing the min. wage. Simply yelling that everyone who is concerned about a $15 min. wage is a corporate shill really just shows a naivete as to the fact that policy has consequences, many of them unintended. ","Reddit"

She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

"12354",1460744196,"This column encapsulates Reddit, /r/politics, and /r/SandersforPresident in a nutshell:

&gt;What you see, on this as on multiple issues, is the casual adoption, with no visible effort to check the premises, of a story line that sounds good. It’s all about the big banks; single-payer is there for the taking if only we want it; government spending will yield huge payoffs — not the more modest payoffs conventional Keynesian analysis suggests; Republican support will vanish if we take on corporate media.

&gt;In each case the story runs into big trouble if you do a bit of homework; if not completely wrong, it needs a lot of qualification. But the all-purpose response to anyone who raises questions is that she or he is a member of the establishment, personally corrupt, etc.. Ad hominem attacks aren’t a final line of defense, they’re argument #1.

&gt;I know some people think that I’m obsessing over trivial policy details, but they’re missing the point. *It’s about an attitude, the sense that righteousness excuses you from the need for hard thinking and that any questioning of the righteous is treason to the cause.* **When you see Sanders supporters going over the top about “corporate whores” and such, you’re not seeing a mysterious intrusion of bad behavior into an idealistic movement; you’re seeing the intolerance that was always just under the surface of the movement, right from the start.**

I started out as neutral. I'm not American and I like to watch American politics from afar because I don't have to get emotionally invested and I don't have to eventually pick a side. But then the Sanders supporters got just so very toxic.

**Sanders supporters, you need to pay attention to this:** Your movement is toxic. You've taken it and tarnished it and smeared shit all over it. You've treated everyone who wasn't a True Believer in Bernie Sanders like a pariah, or like they're an evil paid corporate shill. You've acted like condescending assholes that nobody wants to associate with.

You will look back on this one day and you will cringe with embarrassment. You will get involved more deeply in politics one day and you will realize that your actions helped strangle Bernie Sanders's presidential bid in its cradle. You will look back at this and realize that you acted completely contrary to how people need to act in politics to win supporters.

It's sad this article is getting downvoted, because you need to read it. You guys need to know one of the reasons Bernie is losing and why he will never win.","Reddit"

"12757",1460737844,"The points raised in the article are all likely true, but that does not mean that the issue should be dismissed out-of-hand.

If part of the effect is due to ""Women also tend to leave the workforce for periods to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay, and choose careers that tend to have lower pay."", then we need to look at a way to address this. 

When my child was born, I asked my boss if I could work part-time for six months to help my wife out. I wanted to work a ""90%"" schedule where I could take off every other Friday to give my wife a break (I had used up my vacation for parental leave). He looked at me like I had two heads and told me that the logistics of that were too hard to work out (the company is mid-sized, with over 500 employees). He would not let me do this even though I assured him that I could still do 100% of my duties in 90% of the time.

A number of women had part-time schedules in the company, but they were almost universally looked down upon. So there was not only a different standard in allowing part-time work (women could grudgingly get this, men could not), but there was a different opinion given when this was used.

Of course, the ""corporate"" message is ""yes, you should definitely be penalized, career-wise, if you choose to work less"".

&gt;This Friday, while her opponent Bernie Sanders is in the Vatican discussing global poverty with the presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador among others, ex-Goldman Sachs partner Gary Gensler will host a fundraiser for Clinton in Hong Kong.

"26811",1460695609,"Anarcho-Capitalism is not ideologically representative of the Black Panters.

Like. At all.


  We Want An End To The Robbery
  By The Capitalists Of Our Black Community.


That's point number three of the Ten-Points Program, a manifesto written by Black Panther founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. I don't know how much more direct you can make it.

The Black Panthers were Marxists, students of a school of conflict sociology. AnCaps and other neoliberals will characterize an essential conflict in government vs. private interest, but that is not, precisely, fundamental to the Marxist conceit. Rather, the essential conflict is class based, with capitalism being the most recent development in exploitation. For Marxists like the Black Panthers, racism is not just some kind of hateful whimsy that only becomes violently destructive when the government jackboots get in on it. Rather, it is itself a product of capitalist self-interest. 

You've heard of how ""workers must seize the means of production,"" right? In chattel slavery, such as was practiced in the American South, the workers are indistinguishable from the means of production; they're owned as property in exactly the same commodified manner as a plantation field or a cotton 'gin. Racist exclusion was no less useful for maintaining an exploitable underclass after the civil war, either. For example, the prisoner leasing programs provided slaves-in-all-but-name as a direct byproduct of racist belligerence among law enforcement. The draft during the Vietnam War press-ganged thousands of young men to fight the enemies of capitalism, but passed over people who were in university, which, generally speaking, did not include a lot of black people. Finally, because obviously there are also plenty of working-class white people, racism is a method of division which foils any effective anti-capitalist sentiment by stirring up proletariat infighting.

Pursuant to the last point, I'll also note that, as time went on, the Panters curved away from Black Nationalism and into Revolutionary Internationalism. Yes, the Black Panthers were anti-establishment, but not because they were merely laissez-faire. They were anti-establishment because, in their opinion, the establishment in question was a longstanding edifice of capitalist values. The answer, for them, is not to simply open up a power vacuum where that government stood, if it just means that the consolidated power of the bourgeois withstands the move to ""anarchy"" and starts cutting deals to trade food to people in return for their eternal bondage. That's just a regression. Rather, to the Black Panthers (and other Marxist groups), the answer is solidarity among the exploited class and opposition to the ideologies which created a class disparity, of which racial disparity is only one kind. That doesn't mean you don't have a government. For many, it means you run one.

So, to answer your question:


  Why don't black people embrace anarcho-capitalism when it would encourage groups like the Black Panthers?


Because the only way an anarcho-capitalist encourages an actual Black Panther is by provoking him.

"26812",1460700036,"There are some elected officials who choose not to use a holy book.

Notably, John Quincy Adams recounted that he had used a volume of constitutional law, with the implication that he was swearing on the principles of constitutionalism itself. Franklin Pierce did not swear an oath at all, exercising the nuance of a constitutionally-mandated option to merely affirm the oath. 

That this distinction was honored is, itself, important, because there actually is a difference. By definition, swearing is a divine invocation. This is a point of some religious significance to sects such as the Anabaptists, who foreswear the taking of oaths in compliance with the Sermon on the Mount. Keep in mind that the reason some of these sects put down roots in the New World in the first place was to escape religious disenfranchisement. So, owing to the same impulse as the First Amendment, Article II of the constitution recognizes that is not necessary to swear an oath, because it would be a point of religious qualification. Contrariwise, you might look to the example of Charles Bradlaugh, an English parliamentarian-elect who was found incapable of swearing an oath (and thus, qualifying for his office) because he didn't believe in the god that he was required to swear it to!

What I'm getting at, here, is that all of these people who have sworn oaths on the bible have done entirely so because it was their personal choice, not because any of it (even the swearing itself) is mandatory. In theory, anyway. Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon were both Quakers, which would ostensibly direct them to affirm. Nonetheless, they both conformed to convention and chose to swear. Could this indicate a de-facto religious pressure on the office of President? Well, yeah, of course, but it's also possible that neither of those men placed much importance by the nuance. Times change. 

Either way, if one does make the choice to swear in, it is only natural to substantiate it upon a holy text.

We may have Washington to blame.

For some of the prominence of such conventions, that is. You see, the actual content of the President's inaugural oath is constitutionally mandated:


  Before he enters the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""


Wait, is something missing? As related by Washington Irvine, our first President apparently thought so. After he took the oath, he kissed the bible he'd sworn on and intoned ""so help me god!"" Concluding with such words remains a tradition to this day, though it is of course completely extraneous to that which is directed by law.

"26816",1460709340,"FiveThirtyEight did a reasonably good job of analyzing this for the bound delegates.  It doesn't really cover the unbound delegates.  

I'm not going to repeat the analysis they give there.  It is certainly possible for Trump to make it to 1237 purely with bound delegates.  He would need to win 479 of the 744 remaining or 64%.  But their analyses suggests that he will fall about 80 short.  Assuming that there are about 200 unbound delegates on the first ballot, he would therefore need about 40% of them to make a majority.  

So Trump either needs to outperform their expectations by about 20% or he needs to convert enough unbound delegates to make up the difference.  

New York is an instructive example.  538's path to 1237 has Trump winning 91 of 95 delegates from New York.  But if he finishes third (or second with the first place finisher over 50%) in one district and second in another, he'd get 0 of 3 and 1 of 3 respectively.  That would take him down to 90.  Even if he finishes first in five districts but below the 50% mark, he'd only get 2 of 3 delegates in each district and fall short.  Polls show Trump with 50% to 60% of the vote statewide, averaging about 54%.  At 60% he might have enough to make 50% in each district, but at 50% he almost certainly wouldn't.  If he falls short of 91 delegates in New York, he'll have to make up those delegates elsewhere.  

I haven't seen congressional district level polls of Trump support, even though that would be what's needed to predict his vote totals in New York and other states that award delegates by congressional district results.  Most projections are going to be somewhat weak without that kind of data.  

I saw on the news today that the Trump campaign is currently projecting themselves at 1265 bound delegates.  This remains possible.  It is certainly much more likely than that Cruz will pass Trump before the convention.  But it's a steep climb.  

I don't see how Trump can expect to get more than a 100 unbound delegates on the first ballot.  That would mean that he needs at least 1137 bound delegates.  And that may give him more support than he really has.  He tends to do worse in conventions and other circumstances where people can't vote for him directly.  He might well find himself stuck at 60 unbound delegates.  That would mean that he needs 1177 bound delegates.  That's about 20 delegates ahead of the 538 projection.  

You may hear a lot of talk about rule 40b.  Most of it is rather confused.  First, Cruz has won a majority of the delegates in seven states already:  Texas; Kansas; Maine; Idaho; Utah; Wisconsin; Colorado.  He also will likely get the vote of a majority of the Louisiana delegates (having signed all ten of the unbound delegates) and seems well poised for victory in Wyoming.  Either would allow him to met the requirement.  

Second, rule 40b doesn't prevent votes for any candidates.  It prevents them from receiving floor nominations where they get to talk on television (as covered in 40c) and from having their names read in the vote count (rule 40d).  In 2012, Ron Paul was short of the eight states but he still received 190 of the first ballot votes.  While Kasich, Cruz, and other potential candidates may appreciate getting to talk on television, they won't need to talk on television to reach delegates.  They can talk to delegates directly.  

In terms of other rules, I wouldn't expect them to have much effect either.  The rules committee won't want to give the appearance of changing the rules for this election.  In fact, I suspect that they won't want to give the impression of rules affecting the election in any way.  

Trump also has the problem that if he doesn't win on the first ballot, many of his delegates (and everyone else's) become unbound.  This is why many observers think that the first ballot is his best if not only chance to win the nomination.  If he can get to 1237 then, he wins.  If not, he probably doesn't.

But as these 2 officer were Muslims and festival was of Hindus, some people and politicians gave it a communal color and demanded for dismissal of these 2 officer. People done celebrations with Fireworks and the bad incident took place.
In the 2nd incident where the Hindu devotee woman wanted to enter inside the core of the  another Hindu temple named as Mahalaxmi Temple in Kolhapur district of Maharashtra state for praying .But temple administration refused to permit her as they think that it is against Hindu culture. But with the Court's order the district collector and district police commissioner of Kolhapur district helped her to get inside the core of the temple.  But while entering the core of the temple the Hindu woman devotee was badly beaten by the people . Here,both these officers are from Hindu religion who helped that Hindu devotee to enter inside the Hindu temple. But after that some people as well as politicians are demanding dismissal of both district collector and district police commissioner.

Assuming the candidate doesn't drop out on her or his own:

The delegates have complete control over the convention.  They could vote in a rule prior to the nomination vote that said that the candidate was not eligible and vote in someone else.  Many of them may still be bound to vote for that candidate, but the rules would say that the candidate could not win.  There is no rule saying explicitly that having enough bound delegates to make up a majority of the delegates awards victory.  

For example, if Hillary Clinton is convicted of abuse of classified information after winning 2383 bound delegates in primaries, her own delegates could vote in a rule precluding anyone convicted of a felony from winning the nomination.  They'd be bound to vote for her on the first ballot but that wouldn't count.  Most would be unbound on later ballots and could vote for someone else.  That someone else might be Bernie Sanders but not necessarily.  They could pick someone else entirely.  

To continue, Clinton could then turn state's evidence against Donald Trump on a bribery charge.  Trump gets convicted too but has at least 1237 bound delegates.  The Republican delegates modify rule 40 to exclude votes for convicted felons.  Some of the delegates may be unbound immediately, e.g. Minnesota and Oklahoma are only bound if the candidate is nominated.  Cruz, Kasich, or some other candidate could be nominated.  

Note:  neither scenario is likely.  This is just a semi-realistic chain of events to illustrate what could happen.  

All that said, if either party did this, they'd need a really good reason to avoid a backlash.  They'd probably try hard to get a unanimous decision on the rule change so as to provide cover against charges of interfering with the election.  They'd specifically try to recruit the previous supporters of the candidate to be removed.

They probably didn't.  They likely thought that it would change the conversation at the time.  They had been talking about her failure to release transcripts for her speech.  As a gambit, it was mildly successful although the moderator did ignore it in the immediate followup.  

It also allowed her to make the statement that she had complied with the actual requirements while Bernie hadn't.  

I strongly suspect that the net result is going to be nothing.  Hillary supporters will stay Hillary supporters; Bernie supporters will stay Bernie supporters.

Based on the edit that provided more context as to the exchange that actually occurred, I would say three things:


His answer does a good job of addressing ways in which he thinks victims should be helped.
His answer is still lacking because it doesn't provide a plan for addressing the root cause, just for helping victims. To re-use the analogy below, he's saying that we should provide ways for victims to report being mugged, but he's not offering advice on how to reduce mugging.
The last statement he made is still troubling, even in this context, for the reasons laid out below.


Original answer below

You and some friends want to go check out an area of town that has a great restaurant, movie theater, bar, club, etc., but the location of the venues are in an area that has a reputation for being a rough part of town. Being social creatures, you really want to check this place out because you think it will be a lot of fun. Along the way you get mugged.

In this example, Kasich's advice would be,


  ""I will give you one bit of advice. Don’t go to a part of town where
  there’s a lot of crime.""


Certainly following this advice would reduce your risk of getting mugged, but it would also cause you to miss out on many social gatherings. In this example, is the problem that you went to a rough part of town, or is it that this part of town has a higher crime rate? Should our public figures be advocating avoiding that part of town or ways in which we can reduce the crime rate and improve the safety in that part of town?

Rewording the statement won't do because what was said doesn't address the actual issue, it simply offers up advice to try and avoid the problem. It's important to offer advice on how to stay safe, but it's more important to go after the root cause of what is making a situation unsafe.

"26888",1460978381,"""Did they fail — they succeed"", answers above (which could be longer), show that your assumption is not correct. But I want to add some points:  

If we see a revolution or a movement (Arab spring, 99%,...) stopped, it doesn't mean it is failed completely. The protesters are living in the country, some of them satisfied (by media, government arguments,...)  some not; The more a government is sever, the more people will be unsatisfied. The revolution movement could resume any time.  

The ""Arab spring"" suffered from lack of leadership.  

Some reasons differs case by case:   


In Egypt: the previous ruler was overthrew and Morsi elected as President. But he failed to act as people want. (He didn't improve economy. He continued to have good relationship with Saudi Arabia and Israel). Then he lost people's support.  
In Bahrain: United States Navy base in Bahrain +  Saudi Arabia. Note that Population of Bahrain is 1300000, So a little foreign interfere can have big effect.  
In Iran: One revolution succeed in 1979. But the case what you called ""green revolution"", it was not in fact a revolution. In capital Tehran ""Mousavi"" had more votes but in the whole country ""ex-president Ahmadinejad"" had more.  Mousavi refused to accept election results and you saw protests in Tehran. In the other cities there was not serious problems; only some protests with low population. But media exaggerated it as a revolution in country (because Mousavi was pro-western and Ahmadinejad was anti-israel). I was in Northwest of Iran at the time. A friend ask me about those who (he read on the internet) killed. I said there is not even one Wounded; A surprise for him.  
In Yemen: it resulted in civil wars because of ""Saudi Arabia's interfere"" and not being united.  
In Syria: We have  world war not civil war. One side is US, EU, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, ... . Other side is Russia, Iran, Hezbollah,... ; China politically help this side.

While advising women to avoid this environment because it is unsafe is certainly a valid stop-gap measure to protect women from sexual assault in the short term, it comes at the cost of giving up their right to social participation. The long-term goal should be to change society in a way that people consider it a bad idea to sexually assault other people, no matter how drunk the victim or themselves.

That's why feminists react so hostilely to statements like this. The stop-gap measure is presented as a permanent solution to distract from the need for societal change. What feminists would like to hear instead is a statement like:


  ""It is unacceptable that women can not safely go to parties where there’s a lot of alcohol. That's why I propose [measures] to prevent people from committing sexual assault.""


What ""measures"" are appropriate to reach this goal is another topic we could debate about endlessly, but acknowledging that the behavior of the perpetrators should change and not that of the victims is an important first step to reach a better society for everyone (yes, also for the heterosexual men who will certainly enjoy the company of women while getting drunk).

The advice requires her to give something up.  Some people like to go to parties where there's alcohol, and it's not fair that they have to give that up in order to feel safe from crime.  
Many people use ""advice"" as a way to dismiss a problem. A lot of the time, people will say ""just do x"" as a way to dismiss the problem altogether.  My personal mental prototype of this phenomenon has to do with a somewhat esoteric example where in Magic the Gathering a player can fish for information by incorrectly proposing a shortcut, and the response of the community boils down to a dismissive ""Just ask them how many tokens they're making, even if it doesn't matter"".  I personally don't think that Kasich was doing this, but I can understand how some people might associate what he said with that kind of dismissal.
It sounds similar to actual victim blaming.  Some people interpret this to be victim blaming.  I.E. ""It's your fault you got raped because you went out drinking.""  The drinking example is one of the prototypical examples of victim blaming for rape, and I have to believe that it found it's way into the zeitgeist because people have actually used it that way in the past.  I don't believe that Kasich used it in this way, but I can understand why people think about this kind of victim blaming when Kasich said what he said.

"26927",1461072356,"Some people seem to think that having a private insurance is good enough and the people is to blame, but reality is not that simple.

TL/DR Let's put it this way: if you do not trust your bank to return your money to you... why do you think your insurance firm will be able to do so? To avoid people not trusting the bank the FDIC exists.

First, to understand: there are two types of issues with banks:


Crash/Bankruptcy: The bank owes $X. The assets of the bank (including money that the bank has borrowed) are less than $X.
Bank run: The bank owes $X. The assets of the bank are more than enough to pay $X, but most of them are not liquid enough (they are mostly as loans that will be paid in the coming months or years). By some cause, people loses trusts in the bank and wants to retire all of his money, and the bank cannot pay because not all of his assets can be converted to money so quickly.


The bankruptcy will be caused by the bank taking too much risks or by mismanagement, the bank run may be completely unrelated to the actual health of the bank.

Now, if the bank goes down in a period of economic growth, maybe insurance firms can take the hit. But the fact is that banks are most likely to go down during depression times (people and business who borrowed money fill for bankruptcy and the money will not be returned). So, what happens then?

Well, your insurance company did not take your money and bury it in a hole, waiting to need it. They invested it, most probably in conservative strategy. In other words, the insurers money is in the banks.

So Bank A crashes, and the insurers go and retire money to pay the claims. Now Bank B or C, who were more or less surviving the depression, find that suddenly they have lost a lot of liquidity, and that may find trouble returning people deposits. Some people are aware of it and go to the bank to ensure that they are the first in line to get their money back... and now Bank B and/or C are under too. Guess what happens next?

Other point of the issue is that insurance fees are calculated on the basis that disasters are few and strange. To put it simply: if a hurricane strikes your town and 10% of the homes are demolished, to make it even your insurance fee would be to have 10% of the cost of rebuilding your house (I do not know how much you pay but I bet not that much). If it is not and such a disaster exists, your insurance provider may very well go under, too. That is why special measures are taken for natural disasters. A bank going under is not a natural disaster, but (unless for small banks) it usually affects so many people that its effects are similar. The ""too big to fail"" term is not a meaningless one (that said, if a bank ""too big to fail"" fails, there should be a inquiry into the reason and a punishment for mismanagement if that happened).

Add to that the typical corporate shennanigans (remember when credit agencies gave A+ qualifications to everything their customers put in the market?) Ask for private insurance, and you will get the insurance offered to you in the bank office, by an insurance firm that is so closely tied with the bank that will have not funds when something happens.

And finally, imagine this scenario: you open your mail, and read a letter from your insurance company telling you that the fee for insuring your money in Bank A has gone from 0.1% to 0.5%. What would you do?


Nothing, because you are sure that if something happens your insurance company will pay you.
Run to the bank and get your money out of there as quickly as you can, fighting the hordes of customers trying to do the same, before the increased risk materializes.


Also it is worth noting that many people do not have that much money to deposit. If you tell someone that, added to almost null interest, they will have to pay for insurance to ensure the $20K that are their life savings,  most probably many people will retire their money and store it at home.

OTOH, you cannot either go without ensuring at least partially the deposits, because that way any rumour (with base or without it) risks causing a bank run. At the appearance of even the slightest hint of recession, all people would retire their money from the bank and a total collapse would happen.

"26946",1461109472,"You ask why rather than how. I will assume that you know that each state sets its own rules (subject to the main party rules) as shown below. 

The parties enforce national rules to a certain extent, but leave many details up to the states. Before going into why I will summarize the current national rules. Otherwise some people think that the national rules are completely rigid or that it is a complete free for all at the state level.

How Political Party Convention Delegates are Chosen


  Delegates to the national conventions are selected at the state level,
  according to rules and formulas determined by each political party's
  state committee. While these rules and formulas can change from
  state-to-state and from year-to-year, there remain two methods by
  which the states choose their delegates to the national conventions:
  the caucus and the primary.


Democrats use a proportional method. Each candidate is awarded a number of delegates in proportion to their support in the state caucuses or the number of primary votes they won. However, the decision to use the primary or caucus method is left up to the state. There are also some states that use winner take all (or most) method). States also differ as to whether the proportion is calculated statewide or by district.

Democratic Detailed Delegate Allocation give the detailed national rules. Within these rules, each state may set up its own rules.

Democratic Delegate Selection and Voter Eligibility


  The rules of the Democratic National Convention call for the following
  formula to be used in determining the allocation of delegate votes to
  each jurisdiction sending a delegation to the Convention.
  
  Each jurisdiction with electoral votes is assigned a number of Base
  (delegate) votes based on an ""Allocation Factor"" multiplied by 3,200
  [Call Rule I.B.] arrived at through a calculation
  
  To summarize, half of a jurisdiction's base vote is determined by the
  number of Presidential Electors assigned to that state and half are
  computed by the number of people who voted for the Democratic
  Presidential candidate in the last three elections.


The Republican rules require that the delegates be chosen by primary, caucus, or convention. Some states (such as Colorado) use a series of conventions at the lowest level that choose the delegates to the convention  at the next highest level. This culminates in a statewide convention to choose the delegates to the national convention (though this is the only one that the popular media cover). Proportional representation can mean statewide or by individual district or a combination of methods.

Republican Delegate Allocation

Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation


  
    These rules appear to state that delegates must be elected by
    winner-take-all or proportional primaries, caucuses, and conventions.
    Direct delegate election by primary is also permitted.
  


The main reason is that the United States was set up as a federal republic in which each state is regarded as an independent political entity. Each state chooses the delegates of the state in the same way that it elects its own representative. As a result, they would refuse to allow any one outside the state to dictate the rules for delegate allocation. If the national party hierarchy attempted to enforce uniform rules, such as all states must be ""all for one"" or ""statewide proportional representation"" or ""proportional representation by congressional district"", the party would fall apart as the individual states objected to being told what to do.

As a result, the national party sets general rules and limits, and the individual states determine the rules for the following election cycle.

"26958",1461191678,"Why does the US have military bases in friendly countries?


Logistics: The US has military bases all over the world. This, in addition to things like aircraft carriers and air patrols, allows the US to respond quickly to unexpected threats.
Show of friendship: Many allies of the US depend on its military, in whole or in part, for their defense. Keeping a contingent of personnel and resources in the allied country reinforces the commitment of the alliance.
To facilitate allied military operations: During many missions, a coalition of allied forces will participate. This may involve things like e.g. loading French soldiers and British tanks onto an American plane on a military base in Germany.
Show of power: Having lots of bases all over the world is a way of intimidating enemies. Many US bases are concentrated around countries that pose a potential threat to the US and/or its allies.


Why SE Asia in particular?


Historical reasons: SE Asia was hit hard in WWII. During the Cold War, it became one of the focal points of the conflict. Communist influence from China and Russia spread into SE Asia and the US attempted to halt and contain it (see the Vietnam War and the Korean War). The amount of military activity in this area during the 20th century necessitated the establishment of local bases.
North Korea: North Korea is considered a significant threat to the region, especially to South Korea and Japan which are two of America's closest allies in the area. Keeping troops nearby discourages the DPRK from launching direct attacks, and helps US allies feel safe.
China: The US and China have a complicated relationship. There is currently conflict between the two powers regarding claims to the South China Sea, a conflict which has been simmering for some years now. Both sides have been positioning their respective militaries back and forth trying to gain an advantage. While neither side wants a confrontation, the threat involved requires keeping troops available nearby.

"26959",1461201635,"The issues involving Iran are quite exceptional, focusing primarily on these issues gives a rather misleading picture about the NPT. So, let's start with considering what the whole point of the NPT is.

When nuclear technology was developed after WWII, it was clear that the vast majority of the countries in the World would not be able to develop this technology on their own, which would mean that they would not be able to enjoy the benefits of nuclear energy unless they would be given access to it by the few countries that had developed it. Note that at that time, the public image of nuclear image was different from what it is now, it was seen as a miracle energy source, with only a small amount of enriched uranium needed to power a giant 1000 megawatt plant.

There was one big obstacle standing in the way of realizing this nuclear utopia, and that was that the same technology could be used to produce nuclear weapons. The NPT treaty is a solution to this specific problem, it imposes restrictions on how a country can use the acquired nuclear technology. It imposes an inspections regime and transparency rules to verify that a country is sticking to the rules. These transparency rules mean that the member state cannot pursue any nuclear weapons related activities.

However, at heart, the NPT is not a restrictive treat that can prevent countries from produce nuclear weapons on their own. One can see that most clearly from article ten of the NPT that allows countries to leave the NPT after giving a 3 months notice. So, signing the NPT is not an irreversible act that would irreversibly revoke a countries sovereign right to develop nuclear weapons, it's just that a country is barred from using whatever it gets by virtue of being part from the NPT, to pursue a weapons program.

But for transparency purposes, this means that the country cannot pursue a nuclear weapons program as long as it is part of the NPT even if it were able to keep weapons related activities separate from what it would get from its NPT membership. In case of India, a special arrangement was made to allow the US to sell civilian nuclear technology to India. In this case India had to implement certain measures to keep its weapons related activities separate from its civilian infrastructure.

Since in practice, the only realistic way things could spiral out of control leading to a World where we would have wars breaking out fought with nuclear weapons, would be due nuclear technology spreading, and not due to countries developing nuclear technology on their own. Therefore the NPT is a very important treaty to make sure this does not happen and to get to  nuclear disarmament. To achieve the latter aim, the NPT asks the declared nuclear power to engage in negotiations to reduce their nuclear stockpiles. The treaty has been updated several times to make it stronger, e.g. the Additional Protocol has been added to strengthen the transparency about nuclear activities of member states.

Now, as I mentioned at the start, Iran's case is exceptional, it has little to do with how the NPT is supposed to work. It's a good example of how it is not supposed to work and how things can spiral out of control due to distrust. Basically the problem started  back in the 1980s when the US was worried that Iran's access to nuclear technology via the NPT could be abused for a weapons program even if Iran were never to violate any rules. So, the scenario that the US feared was that Iran simply sticks to all the rules, Iranian scientists and engineers get familiar with nuclear technology and then Iran can later decide to leave the NPT by invoking Article ten during some conflict. Obviously the Iran-Iraq war going on at that time was such a conflict that led to the suspicions that Iran would likely be motivated to pursue nuclear weapons.

This thinking led to the US to impose diplomatic pressure on countries involved in Iran's nuclear program, leading to delays in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear powerplant:


  According to Moscow Defense Brief, until 2005 Washington exerted considerable diplomatic pressure on Russia to stop the project, as the US administrations viewed it as evidence of Russia's indirect support for the alleged Iranian nuclear arms program. The United States also tried to persuade other countries to ban their companies from taking part. For example, Ukraine's Turboatom was to supply a turbine, but cancelled the deal after the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to Kiev on 6 March 1998. The United States lifted its opposition to the project in 2005, partly due to the deal signed by Moscow and Tehran, under which spent fuel from the plant would be sent back to Russia.


This attitude likely led to Iran to make the decision to pursue an enrichment program in the late 1990s. Obviously if you can hardly get access to nuclear technology to get the Bushehr reactor finished, getting fuel for it would probably be impossible. And in the 1990s, Iran could not know that in the 2000s Putin would be Russia's leader who would steer Russia a bit clear from Western pressure. For all Iran could know in the 1990s, Russia was well on its way to become more integrated with the West, so it would likely become more under pressure from the US to stop being involved in its nuclear program.

Now, the way Iran decided to get the nuclear technology needed for enrichment violated some aspects of the transparency rules, but there were no breaches of the safeguard agreements. Inspections performed later by the IAEA never found evidence of activities related to a weapons program. Also Iran did not violate any rules for having build the Natanz enrichment facility and not a priori notified the IAEA about it, as under the rules, Iran was only supposed to notify the IAEA 6 month's before it would become operational.

But, obviously, the US plan to prevent Iran from operating any large nuclear powerplants lay in tatters after it was found out that Iran had constructed an enrichment facility. Also it was fuel to the US' original suspicion that Iran's access to nuclear technology was actually a problem regardless of whether or not this was done by ""by the book"". Rather than recognize that its efforts to restrict Iran from having access to nuclear technology had backfired, the US wanted to impose new restrictions. But the only way forward was to get international support for the US position.

This was the start of a decade long back and forth fight involving Iran's rights and international obligations that has nothing whatsoever to do with the NPT. It's far more about how the US despite being a superpower failed to get its way. It has been a long retreat from its original aim to prevent Iran from operating nuclear powerplants to prevent it from having the technology to enrich uranium, to prevent it from actually operating centrifuges to prevent it from operating an industrial scale enrichment program to where we are today, which is basically what Iran proposed back in 2003, i.e. a system that ensures Iran's right to all technology including industrial scale enrichment while making sure that Iran does not produce nuclear weapons.

So, you cannot consider the whole brouhaha between Iran and the West in terms of just the NPT, the NPT was just invoked to fight out a conflict that would also have existed had Iran never signed the NPT. Note that the US applied pressure on the IAEA to refer Iran to the UNSC, so that the UNSC could impose restrictions on Iran's nuclear program that went beyond Iran's obligations under the NPT. The IAEA's role from that point onward was changed, it had to check if Iran was sticking to the UNSC demands. Clearly an Iran outside of the NPT would only have meant that the IAEA route not been available to the US. But nothing would then have stopped the US from raising Iran directly at the UNSC. The UNSC would have been free to impose restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities regardless of its NPT membership.

During the last decade the fundamental issue, as far as the West was concerned, was Iran's refusal to stop enriching uranium. But Iran never signed any agreement that would demand that it do so. Therefore it was Iran not sticking to a hypothetical agreement that it actually did not sign, not the NPT, that was the core issue.

In order to find out, I found Article 5 (relevant parts are bolded):


  The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.


I would guess that these conventions are large gatherings, but I was wondering several things about them:


Who participates in these conventions?
How are conventions for proposing amendments different from those meant to ratify amendments?
How is it decided whether an amendment is ratified at the convention.  (majority? supermajority?)
How are conventions conducted?

"26967",1461263048,"There are some grey areas because there haven't ever been conventions for amendments. The first part is pretty straightforward, if two thirds of state legislatures call for a convention then Congress is responsible for setting up a place and time for the convention. From that point presumably each state could individually decide to attend and select a delegation to represent them. Then it would be up to the members at the convention to create the rules they want to follow to determine which amendments are proposed.

Convention for ratifying would be different, each state would have their own convention where the appointed members would decide whether or not to ratify a proposed amendment. It would be up to congress to declare that conventions are required to ratify a proposed amendment.

Conventions are generally allowed to create their own rules, and the end result would be something similar to a session in congress or any other legislature. Conventions can be extremely open ended, the constitutional convention was supposed to be a convention to amend the articles of confederation, however they ended up proposing an entirely new government.

Second, he may well have received a campaign benefit from going to the Vatican.  It certainly got him a lot of ""free"" media before, during, and after the trip.  

Third, Donald Trump pays his own company for his travel with campaign funds, which is directly against the rules.  Yet no one is trying to prosecute him.  It's difficult to prosecute people for campaign finance violations.  

Fourth, it is far more likely that the FEC would simply make Sanders pay his campaign back if they did find wrongdoing.  They haven't recommended prosecution since 2008.  

It would be trivial to argue that his campaign benefited from his trip even if he was not on the ""campaign trail"".  I doubt that it will receive serious consideration.

Every countries running by any particular system is imperfect and yet we will only enlarge the cons of each other and cover the logical reasoning and methods available that today is easily implementable with out level of technology. All for the gains of 1%. The focus on political power and economy using legislation in laws are forever one step behind to ensure the advantage of minority over the majority.  

The China issue is not about democracy but how much can they had improved till today in such a short time and their current system is proven to be right for this country. Yes. freedom, media control, human rights issue, corruption, injustice are still prevailing but until the rest of the world can stop trading with them or willing to send army in to take over then its pointless to keep talking but rather try and change them faster for the better. 

Democracy had started on a stage of one people one vote in the west and let the majority of people decide. We had set legal age limit on when you can vote through logical reasoning but yet failed to move to next stage when our evolution required a more responsive, rational democratic system. It will need to take into considerations of factors like age ( why a first time voter young man had same voting right as a 70 grandfather contributing.), qualification(professional of all fields can have their own associations or NGOs globally and yet experts view are so minimized and influenced so great greatly by political parties or corporations. We are fast to create profits with bad products and services but take how long to stop or control them (tobacco, bacon and ham and now wifi) Always selling to the poorly informed common people for our convenience of quick profit. 

The format of using western developed countries as a model that the are the current best should not be defined 10/10 but rather what else in term of possibility of IT we use to enhance as the correct perfect score. Then this will also bring the developing nations to accelerate faster for improvements. Eg laws should be enforced using all available statistic on a dashboard to put into stricter punishment when certain crime reach certain level and decrease accordingly if necessary(low possibility again as our population increase worldwide only increase crime rate with more criminals of all kinds).eg Even traffic fines should be based on % of income reported or assets instead of fixed amount that is so unfair to the poor and won't hinder the rich behaviour. Might as well give license for speeding outright.

The main cons of democracy is that 1. as long majority of people allowed, there is few mechanism to stop our current system from implementing new rules that are totally wrong morally, logically or rationally. There need to be same counter force to prevent wrong judgement. Some examples are:If majority vote you are not the child of yr biological parent. technically its possible. If majority agree justin can have 100 wifes or taylor swift can drive over any speed limit, why not? The scale of moral and populism must be managed evenly. 2. the term of 2-5 year of any election is too long to wait for next better option and too hard to bring them any elected ones. Look at the poll figures for any person in elected position for any countries in this century and you realized how hard is it to name one person who exit on non-popularity issue. So what incentive is there to be good man all the way when we can have restrictive terms on reasonable doubts to rotate officers but public can't even rate them properly to bring them down fast enough when required based on few bad decisions. We can have millions of trade daily trading in miliiseconds and yet don't even have people based KPIs rating on all government servants like the rating on bank clerk or Mac cashier with a smiley or grumpy face? Even S &amp; P or Moody standards are what we supposed to be paid by govt and yet till the day banks crushes the rating is still good as even. 

The fault lines of democracy are so clear cut and yet logical reasoning on simple problems that explode into headlines will take years to solve. IT will need be used intensively to help people manage the government errors that results in huge monetary and environmental losses to the people. We are still living in the world where in any countries there is no index to know exactly how many people are there alive, gonna be dead or given birth soon. People are missing in Flight like MH370 and Harry porter name can even come out in the Panama Paper. These solutions won't need scientist to come out with and preventive step can easily be written and modified by experts, but never instant to implement. Justice will never come fast enough and might even take forever while crime take only seconds to commit. Protest and riots are too slow or even easily suppress to make real impact. The level of colluding by govts on a level never will be open to public unless wikileak happen is what we can wish for now. Therefore any fight of democracy, human rights,justice, transparency, climate, animal rights etc are all only tools to bring either left, right or center party in any government down but they all have certain level constraints here or there to individuals. The participation rate of any voting that is so hard to reach the 2/3 or 3/4 level is indications of how dishearten people are really. Life goes on when good and bad  event is still 50/50 in any country.The chance any of us get kill in school or by police in US or by China government is the same. I'm lucky to be born in one of those country singapore that neither will EVER happen. Privilege for 5m and rich one who can migrate here. Case of so successful on international scale and yet silence on global issues to avoid earning the irks of trading partners. Moral obligations that can be proven logically and with available statistics must be integrated into IT for the only solutions to solve all global issues with results in sight.

"27015",1461381629,"Well sure, after the crisis, US/Cuba relations were nearly irreparably damaged, causing an extension and expansion of sanctions and embargoes against Cuba (1). You might say, however, that it was just one step of many that have worked against the Cuban economy and culminated with the dissolution of the Soviet Union (5). 

Cuba had established ties with the Soviet Union in '59 (2) which caused tensions and hostilities before and leading up to the missile crisis. This was also the first year that Fidel Castro came into power via the Cuban Revolution(3), and the Soviet Union was reportedly surprised to find that they could have an ally so close to the US (2).

The Soviet Union took pride in the defense and support of Cuba (2):


  The defense of Cuba became a matter of prestige for the Soviet Union, and Khruschev believed that the U.S. would block all access to the island whether by sea or air. Even in the 1980s the Soviet aid wasn't very important, but rather a regular trade with Cuba of more than $8.5 billion in 1989 was reached. But already in 1990 the trade was reduced to $4.5 billion.[5]


The Soviets tried to help (2):


  Washington's increasing economic embargo led Cuba to hurriedly seek new markets to avert economic disaster. Castro asked for help from the Soviets and in response Khrushchev approved the temporary purchase of Cuban sugar in exchange for Soviet fuel. This deal was to play a part in sustaining the Cuban economy for many years to come.


The ""Special Period"" (4):


  The dissolution of the Soviet Union hit the Cuban economy severely. The country lost approximately 80% of its imports, 80% of its exports and its Gross Domestic Product dropped by 34%. Food and medicine imports stopped or severely slowed. The largest immediate impact was the loss of nearly all of the petroleum imports from the USSR;[2] Cuba's oil imports dropped to 10% of pre-1990 amounts.[3] Before this, Cuba had been re-exporting any Soviet petroleum it did not consume to other nations for profit, meaning that petroleum had been Cuba's second largest export product before 1990.

  If you want to take a step back into automotive time, then you need to go to Cuba. That’s a rule in the automotive industry. Havana itself is beautiful, with its brightly colored—if slightly dusty—buildings and milling streets, but there is nothing quite as beautiful as seeing a line of classic cars sitting at an intersection like it’s no big deal.


Why are there so  many old American cars in Cuba? (6):


  Until the 1960 embargo, most new vehicles came to Cuba from the United States until the 1960 United States embargo against Cuba ended both importation of cars and their parts. As many as 60,000 American vehicles are in use,[10] nearly all in private hands. Of Cuba's vintage American cars, many have been modified with newer engines, disc brakes and other parts, often scavenged from Soviet cars, and most bear the marks of decades of use.[11] Pre-1960 vehicles remain the property of their original owners and descendants, and can be sold to other Cubans providing the proper traspaso certificate is in place. Such transactions can be difficult, but in 2010, reforms were expected to legalize the sale between Cuban citizens of all cars.[12]

Introduction

1.The project will look at 3 components: People, Government, Business employed/self-employed. It can be created under a single platform which is big enough or on different ones if the features face restrictions.  The aim is not to create a new technology but to duplicate the best/ available ones which are free, licensed or purchased at low cost to be fused into the whole system. Focus on 100% (as definable) transparency, accountability and build on a credible reputation in which the whole system of operation is verifiable and certified based on which ever highest standard eg ISOs available and improve on it. We are looking to solve the main issues in income inequality, public safety, climate and sustainable environment, crime rates, unemployment, resource management etc.

2.Everything in this world can be faked and misuse for crimes. Protection of individual privacy is one of the greatest excuse that had been crested to keep everyone isolated and even more prone to harm. The level of sophistication in the crimes that can be imagined are so creative that there is no regulations that are enticed into laws fast enough to keep pace. 100% freedom and human rights are impossible and we can gauge and monitor all aspect of the society using facts and statistics. Then proceed to create all scenarios of feasible, possible solutions as options that can gain traction for the different environment to which people can choose to implement, on personal, work or government issues. All revolutions, riots and protest are started by most people of logical and rational reasoning ability to address the unjust and unfair treatment or environment they are in. Therefore we should use every scientific and morally right means to justify every action in a democratic way as possible. 

3.The main features of google docs, watapps/wechat, facebook, survey monkey, ERPs,CRMs, POS, Fedex parcel tracking, GPS, dashboard, KPIs, MMORPG game format(eg second life), E-wallets, Singpass system (form of secured login method), biometric, online banking, smartphone app module, cloud database, IOTs, online camera monitoring, youtube, alibaba etc are what I look to create on this single platform or design separately but linkable. Exclude all high definition graphic or visual aspect as they are not required. The common database will also act as alternate channel to obtain national statistic where in the today world that current government is unable to provide accurately. For all the available technology, OS, software that already exist, the initial stage will focus on identifying them in all areas and setup the database that can manage all the data which will be used to explore the advantages. In the design of the platform, we just need to focus on being the 2nd best as much as possible while the actual product that is already out there could still be used as a supplement if required. Feasible new features better than the actual is bonus.

4.The initial founders or core members will have to contribute on a goodwill voluntary basis due to fact that this project will need to look at the bigger picture of giving earth management a better option that till today all problems and crisis that existed are going to be what we want to prevent in the future. The aspect of crisis management will be deeply shaped into our system that we will go forward as a whole that can influence the decisions making already being in place in real world by countries or governing bodies, directly. Once funding stabilized then we look at providing stable income for all involved in a merit based system according to measured contribution against market rate.

5.Never create what you can’t control is the principal and the approach that our audience will be all living 7B people currently on Earth. Target participation will be half the population of each country where the registration reach will start of the actual system regardless of level of completion.  The initial target will be half the population in any country and based on our main concept of transparency, accountability, credibility set always a level higher than current official standards anywhere. Marketing will be based on giving free credit like the gaming industry, setting a scale over a person lifetime to define different stages and level to create and maintain interest. Initial funding will be from the charity community where we will have online instant figure to provide to the public on the income and expense where no one had done before. An online website where we not only show accounts, but also every actual details in operations.      

6.Due to the scale of the project, different stages for different country will be set 1-10 and resources (human, fund) will set assigned by priority ranking. Any qualified person can come into this project at different part/stage and contribute accordingly (full time, part time, volunteer basis) Currently I will only list the 1st stage as I can only do that much alone without any fund available to put the project onto the implementation stage. But I believe it’s still possible to start off with current technology and connectivity of internet to the mass public if done correctly. My ideal currently is to spread this concept/vehicle of my ideology as wide as possible for people to either start off on their own or partner/sponsor me. I believe me as the driver will be the main difference to the extent this goal can be reach and I don’t mind other to reach the destination before me for the better of mankind. Therefore open source, crowdsourcing, transparency and accountability is my main emphasis. The existence of all different charities and NGOs but with similar purpose show there is always a niche I can create differently.

Stage 1:
-   Get professional editor to format my write up into proper format. 
-   Identify available platform, software- 1 year +
-   Recruit volunteers and like-minded people to form a team of 100s of all fields to brainstorm and improvise
-   Create website to obtain donations, choose a forum to create an interactive open source community that work specific for this project
-   Source of funding is open as long it does not affect the overall direction of the project.

But once in Turkey, they would have to be fleeing *Turkish* persecution to move into Greece as refugees.  That's why they hop on boats.  Because once in Greece, it's hard to move them out.","Stack"

Eastwood only ever held a junior position.  Bono held a junior position (same one as Eastwood) and then a somewhat higher position.  Franken skipped straight to Senator, but is that a junior or a senior position?  He's one of a hundred, a relatively privileged hundred, but he's still not alone.","Stack"

"27034",1461448801,"@Winple-Yes, that is the concept of refoulment; the question is focused on justifying the rejection of refugees via border enforcement. While the signing nations may be required to bring in refugees, acting against that requirement isn't refoulment.","Stack"

"27037",1461455424,"How does this work? By instructing immigration officers, border-guards, military, police or other government branches to prevent refugees from crossing the border.

Of course there are international treaties which would theoretically outlaw this practice, but international treaties are only effective when other states are willing to enforce them. When they do not feel that it is politically wise to get involved (or even in their interest to not get involved, for example because the refugees would move on straight to them when allowed to enter the European Union), they won't.

Note that most of the EU border states haven't officially closed their borders to refugees. They rather insist on refugees passing the border in an ordered and controlled manner where each refugee is registered properly. This of course takes its time because the number of refugees which can be processed that way per day is limited.

"27039",1461456308,"The European Pirate Party got no votes - the national parties did. The only ""successful"" one would be the German Pirate Party, specifically 424,510 (1.45%). They got one MEP (Julia Reda). EU Parliament members are voted separately for each state.

A few other national pirate parties also participated as can be seen here. You can find a table of votes and the relevant percentages.

"27042",1461460038,"You don't ask about any specific politician, but you should be aware that opposition to joining the European Union is not new.  The don't even use the European Union currency.  

In general, the main advantage of Brexit is increased sovereignty.  One of the biggest specific problems recently is that the European Union's position on refugees.  Some in the United Kingdom (UK) would prefer to set their own policy rather than follow the more accepting position of the European Union (EU) as a whole.  They are also concerned about migration within the EU, a position which came to a head during the last recession.  

Another issue is the Greece bailout.  Many feel like they're being called to pay for Greece's profligacy.  This is not unique to the UK, but as they are already only half in the EU, it's easier for them to express it in a separatist movement.

But I will try and mention one or two things of which you and the OP may not be aware.  First, in the 1975 Referendum on whether we should join the EU, 67.2% of those voting said Yes. Since then there have always been rumblings of opposition. There are reasons why this has grown in recent years, but I cannot deal with that in just a few words. – WS2 40 mins ago","Stack"

The others were: •Bulgaria,•Croatia.•Czech Republic.•Denmark.•Hungary.•Poland.•Romania•Sweden. Most of those were part of the former Soviet Bloc, and have far less prosperous economies than the western countries. However Sweden and Denmark have strong economies - but like Britain choose not to join.

But that has little to do with Britain. Only a tiny proportion of Syrian refugees are stuck in a camp in France attempting to gain access to Britain. But rising levels of immigration, partly due to the principal of ""free movement"" within the EU is just one of the important issues. **For a succinct idiot's guide to what the Referendum is all about, try [this BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887)**","Stack"
