Edit: CNN headline - Sanders: I did not abandon New York. Wow.

Edit: since some people seem to be questioning it, yes, [Sanders was invited to the Vatican.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-vatican-idUSKCN0X5257) His campaign did not solicit an invite:

&gt; ""I deny that. It was not that way,"" Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo told Reuters in a telephone interview while he was traveling in New York. Sorondo, a close aide to Pope Francis, is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is hosting the event.

&gt; He said it was his idea to invite Sanders."

Fucking propaganda.  Does anyone still think this election is being run fairly?  When 90% of the media is in the tank for Hillary?"
"8","1460818166","I've commented similar things in a couple threads already, but I feel like this is a message worth spreading. 

We all have a choice, reacting to this news. We could take partisan sides, argue about the details of the trip or discuss whether it was a political ploy. Or we could talk about compassion, discuss how to work together, possibly even make amends across candidate preferences and party lines. 

When someone like the Pope tries to spread peace and compassion throughout the world he gives us an opportunity to follow his lead. He gives us a chance to look away from politics and to look inside ourselves to see what is truly good there. He gives us a chance to rise above heated policy discussions and recognize that in the end we're all in this together. 

Whether or not we agree on policy is one thing, but the more important question is whether we agree on a common goal. Do we agree that we're all in this together, that we're all living on the same Earth, that we're all intrinsically connected? Do we agree that the way to govern is to choose what is right for all of us, not just the few? Do we agree that ethics has a place in politics? Do we agree that people should have shelter and security and that we should work to provide it for the weak and infirm? Do we agree that we should work to benefit the community and not ourselves?

These are important questions that too often get lost in the intricacies of politics. I hope we all agree on the answers, but that's not the point. Just being reminded that the questions exist is enough to change the way we act. Working as individuals isn't how we improve society, but working together is. Reminding ourselves that we have a shared responsibility to take care of each other and the planet is beyond any parties or candidates, it's intrinsic to human life itself. Again -- we're all in this together. You and me, I and them, them and you. We're all one.

So please, /r/politics, let's remember that there are other things in life than politics. "

Here's the [total US prison population by year](http://i.imgur.com/BCNb3rT.jpg).  See if you can spot 1994.  

And here's the [change in the US prison population per year](http://i.imgur.com/C3SV0Yy.jpg).  Note that the rate of increase began declining right after the 1994 crime bill was enacted.

All data from John Pfaff, a Fordham law school professor and expert on mass incarceration.  Here's what Pfaff wrote in the NYT this week:

[Bill Clinton Is Wrong About His Crime Bill. So Are the Protesters He Lectured](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/magazine/bill-clinton-is-wrong-about-his-crime-bill-so-are-the-protesters-he-lectured.html?_r=0)

&gt; We know the act didn’t cause mass incarceration: Prison populations started rising around 1974, and by 1994 they had roughly tripled, from 300,000 to over one million. It’s almost surely the case that America was the world’s largest jailer well before the act was passed. So if the act didn’t cause mass incarceration, the question becomes: Did it help continue to drive it? The answer, by and large, is no.
&gt; 
&gt; For one thing, most of the act’s provisions applied only to federal crimes. The tough new anti-gang laws, the expanded death-penalty provisions, the three-strikes laws: All applied only to those tried in federal court. And those, over all, are fairly minor players, with the federal prison system holding about only 13 percent of all prisoners. The other 87 percent of inmates are in state systems — and none of the act’s new criminal laws affected what happened in state systems.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, there were some provisions of the act aimed at influencing state law. The most important was the Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing (VOI/TIS) Incentive Grant Program, which set aside about $10 billion to encourage states to make parole much rarer for people convicted of violent crimes, through what are called “truth in sentencing” laws. The grants even included funds for building out prison capacity, to deal with any resulting rise in inmate populations. If there was any part of the 1994 act that should have driven incarceration, it was this one.
&gt; 
&gt; And yet it didn’t. In a General Accounting Office study, only four states said the grants strongly influenced their decisions to adopt TIS laws. One of those four, New York, received more grant money than any other state, and its prison populations began a 15-year decline before the six-year program was even over. Almost half of the 27 states with TIS laws said the grants were irrelevant, and 23 states opted not to adopt the laws at all. All told, about 70 to 80 percent of all prisoners were held in states where the grants made no real impact. And there’s no evidence that prison populations grew any faster in states with TIS laws than in states without them."

"149","1460807921","Awesome. I'm glad, mainly because of the way the media has been trying to downplay and smear his visit. For example, been watching CBS News and here's some of what I've been seeing.

1st video segment:
CBS News anchor man explains a bit about what Bernie is going to talk about and how his values in a moral economy align with the Pope's, then the co-anchor lady finishes off the segment with ""It's important to note that the likelihood of him meeting with the Pope Francis is pretty low- in fact, he's probably not going to meet with Pope Francis and to sort of clarify too, he wasn't invited to the Vatican by the Pope but he was invited by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences- typically the Vatican does not light into issues related to politics though we have seen this Pope, ah, dabble here and there with some comments he's made along the way.""

2rd video segment:
Two CBS anchors offscreen discussing Bernie's trip. The first says that the Vatican says Pope Francis has no plans to meet with Sanders, the the second mentions how some are saying that Sanders lobbied to get the invite but that his campaign says the trip is not political. Meanwhile, the giant ticker running across the bottom of the video states ""CANDIDATE NOT LIKELY TO MEET POPE FRANCIS"".

3rd segment:
At the end if the video, CBS anchorman (live from Rome) Seth Dohn (sic) gives some obvious attitude as he says ""The Vatican has distanced itself from this invitation and has told us the Pope will not meet Senator Sanders. This trip was being billed as being above politics, Scott, but rather it seems to be all about politics.""

"150","1460799001","So, at the end of the day does this really surprise anyone?

This whole thing was so weird to watch unfold. Sanders comes out saying he was invited to speak at the Vatican and will meet the Pope and then the whole “no, he wasn’t invited!”-""maybe he asked for an invitation but he won’t speak!”-“maybe he’ll speak but it’s completely meaningless and the Pope won’t even be in the country!”-“okay, maybe the Pope will be in the country but he definitely will not meet Sanders!”-spiel started.

And now here we are, he was invited, he did speak and he did meet the Pope. Did anybody actually believe Sanders was lying?

Edit: Aaaand a quick glance at /r/HRC lets the spiel continue!

* The meeting probably never happened, reports are fake!

* If it did happen, it was a pity meeting!

* Maybe it happened, but meeting the Pope was definitely not worth leaving NY for! ^(also Sanders is a fraud for spending the money of poor college students on his family vacation)

* Meeting the Pope was the lowest move of his campaign so far!

First off, what is a blockade?

&gt;A blockade is an effort to cut off supplies, war material or communications from a particular area by force, either in part or totally. A blockade should not be confused with an embargo or sanctions, which are legal barriers to trade. It is also distinct from a siege in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region, rather than a fortress or city. While most blockades historically took place at sea, blockade is still used on land to prevent someone coming into a certain area.

So a blockade is  defined as blocking of land borders and sea borders. An important thing that should be noted is that Egypt also borders Gaza. Egypt has also blockaded a part of the land border of Gaza. Is Egypt now an occupation force in Gaza?

Another thing that needs to be pointed out is medium of blockade. Historically, blockades at sea and land have only existed because those were the only types of travel. With the invention of air travel, it makes sense that a new form of blockade, as in blockade by the air, would be not allowing planes to fly into Gaza. So an air blockade is no different from a land or sea blockade, it is prevention of goods or things into a territory, except by air.


Blockade is not occupation, and having multiple mediums of blockade doesnt mean one is occupying a country.

 "
"175","1460819155","It's not occupied, she's exactly right"
"176","1460813399","The other part mentioned is the Population Registry.

&gt;Civil registration is the system by which a government records the vital events of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database is called civil register, and the office responsible for receiving registrations is often called the registrar, registry, or population registry. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal document that can be used to establish and protect the rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was Sweden in 1631, which was organized by the Church of Sweden but on the demand of The Crown.
The United Nations defines civil registration as ""the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population as provided through decree or regulation in accordance with the legal requirements of a country. Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents provided by the law. These records are also a main source of vital statistics. Complete coverage, accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential for quality vital statistics.""[1]


So having a count of the population of the Gaza strip is now occupation?

"193","1460833816","Despite the flood of pro-Israel accounts in this thread, this article is 100% right that Israel is still illegally occupied.

&gt; ﻿ Israel argues that its occupation of the Gaza Strip ended with the unilateral withdrawal of its settler population in 2005. It then declared the Gaza Strip to be “hostile territory” and declared war against its population. Neither the argument nor the statement is tenable. **Despite removing 8,000 settlers and the military infrastructure that protected their illegal presence, Israel maintained effective control of the Gaza Strip and thus remains the occupying power as defined by Article 47 of the Hague Regulations.** To date, Israel maintains control of the territory’s air space, territorial waters, electromagnetic sphere, population registry and the movement of all goods and people.

Furthermore, the occupation is a collective punishment of the Palestinian people:

&gt; In early 2006 (after Hamas won elections), Dov Weisglass, then a senior advisor to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, explained that **Israel’s policy towards Gaza was designed “to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.”** In September 2007, Olmert’s government further tightened restrictions Gaza and prohibited the export of all goods.

&gt; In 2012, following a protracted legal battle waged by Israeli human rights group Gisha, the Israeli government released a confidential document produced in 2008 detailing how **Israeli officials had been calculating the minimum caloric intake needed to keep Gazans from starving while maintaining strict control over the import of food.**

If Israel is so reasonable with respect to Gaza, then why does every major human rights group consider the blockade collective punishment that flagrantly violates international law?

&gt; A 2009 Amnesty International report following Operation Cast Lead, Israel’s devastating military assault on Gaza in the winter of 2008-9, stated: 

&gt; **The prolonged blockade of Gaza, which had already been in place for some 18 months before the current fighting began, amounts to collective punishment of its entire population.**

&gt; The Fourth Geneva Convention specifically prohibits collective punishment. Its Article 33 provides: ‘No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.’

According to the International Committee of the Red Cross in a June 2010 statement:

&gt; The whole of Gaza's civilian population is being punished for acts for which they bear no responsibility. **The closure therefore constitutes a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law.**

In September 2010, a UN fact-finding mission into Israel's attack on the flotilla, which tried to deliver critically-needed medical supplies to Gaza, concluded:

&gt; The Mission considers that one of the principal motives behind the imposition of the blockade was a desire to punish the people of the Gaza Strip for having elected Hamas. **The combination of this motive and the effect of the restrictions on the Gaza Strip leave no doubt that Israel’s actions and policies amount to collective punishment as defined by international law.** In this connection, the Mission supports the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, Richard Falk, the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict and most recently the ICRC that **the blockade amounts to collective punishment in violation of Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law**.

So you can whitewash the blockade all you want, but please understand that the human rights consensus is not on your side. Frankly, it is part of a brutal, oppressive occupation that deprives Gazans of control their own lives."

I sincerely thank you for your support of the only party that understands that God needs to be at the very foundation of our country.

Your support of the GOP candidate (even if by not voting, which is outstanding since you were going to vote against them) is what we need to ensure we can turn back LGBT rights.  More importantly, we can more deeply entrench Citizens United, the cornerstone of democracy run by free speech (Super PACs).

It terrifies me that Bernie is urging people to vote for Clinton (and vice versa).  Either one would push the country far more liberal than any GOP candidate.  So completely turning your back on both of them is the best possible way to help the conservative cause this November.

The debates have shown us both want to do things like raise the tax rates on the ultra rich, protect social security, and have a government that provides services for those most in need.  This can not stand, and you're doing your part to help.

God bless."
"338","1460829222","Honestly, you probably weren't going to vote anyway."
"339","1460830006","There's actually a decent amount of overlap between Bernie and Trumps positions.  

* Both want to take care of our Vets and will actually do it.
* Both support access to healthcare, Trump simply feels we can build a better system that wastes less and covers more, which we can.

* Both want to make college either free or very affordable and with super low loan rates forever, 
* Both are fighting the same corrupt political party system and will get rid of the corrupt lobbyist system 

* Both support women's rights and will fund access to planned parenthood.  Trump's daughters praise him as helping to shape them into kind and competent women who know they can achieve anything (don't believe the media's lies about Trump on race and women). 
* Both grew up in the Brooklyn/Queens New York area and support equal opportunity for all races and are very multicultural given their New York upbringing. (again don't believe the media's lies about Trump as he employs more minorities than anyone and values hard work and opportunity.)
* Trump will eliminate the hedge fund tax loophole that lets billionaires like Romney and Warren Buffet pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries.  Bernie will prefer to go even farther against wallstreet and big banks.
* Both are Washington and party outsiders.

* Both want to renegotiate all the terrible trade deals so America doesn't get ripped off anymore.  
* Both want to tax companies that move workers abroad and create more jobs and industry right here in America.
* Both want to repeal citizen's united and remove the corrupt superpac money from politics.
* Both want America to quit fighting wars and maintaining wasteful armies across the planet for foreign governments.  Trump was strongly against the Iraq war way back in 2001/2002 and knew only bad things would come out of it, as was Bernie.

Yes, there are still several differences but one can never get 100% of what you desire and I just wanted to let the Bernie supporters know there is a home for you if Hillary and the DNC screw you over.  Trump does care and wants to make everyone in America great and that includes all the Bernie supporters too!  Also as an FYI, I'm a twice Obama voter so I know where everyone here is coming from and given the Democratic thread, this post will probably still be downvoted but I just wanted to put this out there so people can know some of the similarities."
"340","1460827343","Is it shitpost Saturday already? damn. how time flies...  "
"341","1460829559","If you choose Sanders, that's good choice and it's your right.  But you don't need to justify your decision like this.  CNN to my eyes did a very fair job of handling the debates so far, and their coverage is pretty fair.  Beyond CNN, the media is very heavy handed to Hillary Clinton.  She's got more negative coverage from the liberal media than Sanders does."
"342","1460830371","I disagree with you on multiple fronts about the articles

[First article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-zelizer/index.html) You say CNN ""unabashedly proclaiming Hillary as the clear winner."" What I see is an **opinion** piece  saying that both candidates did well in certain areas but the author thinks Hillary did better at specific policy attacks on Sanders. Not exactly a crazy statement.

[Second article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/clinton-and-sanders-supporters-animosity-opinion-zelizer/index.html) Again an opinion piece, but I think has a lot of merit to it. This is not saying vote for Clinton, its saying that if Sanders wins current climate could turn Clinton voters away from voting for him. I know a lot of people that don't like Sanders, not because they don't like him, but they hate his supporters. They think that Sanders supporters just spam their Facebook walls and insist they just haven't seen the light.

[Third Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/16/politics/bernie-sanders-israel-democratic-politics/index.html) If anything this article praises Sanders for a stance many people have been wanting to make but don't have the balls too. It also brings up the chance that it could backfire if the sentiment isn't taken as positively as he would like. Sounds like an average article to me

[Fourth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/clinton-sanders-views-israel-miller/index.html) Again, an opinion piece. Similarly to the last one its saying to Sanders has taken a very bold and potentially stance on Israel versus Clinton who has taken a very safe stance. Maybe you can call foul at the ""Donald Obama"" part, which I will admit just sounds a bit weird.

[Fifth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/politics/bernie-sanders-jane-sanders-taxes/index.html) Begrudgingly? Is CNN supposed to throw a party because he did released his taxes and unsurprisingly there was nothing interesting in them?

[Sixth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/14/politics/bernie-sanders-religion/index.html) I'm not gonna argue in support of this one too much. I see this one as pandering to your readers, Salon will write articles all day and night asking the question ""Did Hillary flip flop on her stance for Nazi Moon camps"" or something equally ridiculous because certain people eat it up. Its no surprise that CNN does it too.

I feel like a lot of this is just manufactured outrage to maintain the status of the oppressed grass roots little guy, the beacon of light in a dark harbor. Sanders has been doing well the last month or so, and the lack of gains since the wins were in small states can be disappointing. However, it doesnt necessarily mean that there is some sort of massive conspiracy against Sanders. CNN wants a close race, that would make them a lot more money. 
   "
"343","1460828576","It is unprecedented to ask a presidential candidate to release the transcripts from private speeches. 

It is the expectation that a presidential candidate will release substantial tax returns. 

Sanders still has not done so - there have been accusations of impropriety surrounding his finances, especially as they relate to his family and wife. 

He's hiding something. It's not hard to release old tax returns. I could do it very quickly, and I am pretty bad at adulting. 

Sanders must either be hiding something, or an incompetent adult. 

Mentioning Obama repeatedly is not something that should be counted against Clinton - Sanders is running on the premise that Obama wasn't a good president. Clinton is running on the premise that he did a good job, especially considering the circumstances. 

Selling herself as 'Obama's third term' is reasonable, both as being the truth and as a political move.  

Trudeau is a prime minister, not a president. He wasn't directly elected by the people. He's part of a parliamentary government. 

Apples and oranges are not the same. 

Also, 80 percent of millenials don't agree with you - maybe 80 percent of millenials on reddit or twitter, but that's not as many of you as you think. 

Polls show that Sanders supporters say they are going to vote for Clinton at the same (or even higher) rate as Clinton supporters said in 2008. 

Also, the idea that the media are in the tank for Hillary is laughable, unless you're blinded by confirmation bias. Studies show that she gets more negative media than any other candidate.

I sincerely thank you for your support of the only party that understands that God needs to be at the very foundation of our country.

Your support of the GOP candidate (even if by not voting, which is outstanding since you were going to vote against them) is what we need to ensure we can turn back LGBT rights.  More importantly, we can more deeply entrench Citizens United, the cornerstone of democracy run by free speech (Super PACs).

It terrifies me that Bernie is urging people to vote for Clinton (and vice versa).  Either one would push the country far more liberal than any GOP candidate.  So completely turning your back on both of them is the best possible way to help the conservative cause this November.

The debates have shown us both want to do things like raise the tax rates on the ultra rich, protect social security, and have a government that provides services for those most in need.  This can not stand, and you're doing your part to help.

"417","1460830006","There's actually a decent amount of overlap between Bernie and Trumps positions.  

* Both want to take care of our Vets and will actually do it.
* Both support access to healthcare, Trump simply feels we can build a better system that wastes less and covers more, which we can.

* Both want to make college either free or very affordable and with super low loan rates forever, 
* Both are fighting the same corrupt political party system and will get rid of the corrupt lobbyist system 

* Both support women's rights and will fund access to planned parenthood.  Trump's daughters praise him as helping to shape them into kind and competent women who know they can achieve anything (don't believe the media's lies about Trump on race and women). 
* Both grew up in the Brooklyn/Queens New York area and support equal opportunity for all races and are very multicultural given their New York upbringing. (again don't believe the media's lies about Trump as he employs more minorities than anyone and values hard work and opportunity.)
* Trump will eliminate the hedge fund tax loophole that lets billionaires like Romney and Warren Buffet pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries.  Bernie will prefer to go even farther against wallstreet and big banks.
* Both are Washington and party outsiders.

* Both want to renegotiate all the terrible trade deals so America doesn't get ripped off anymore.  
* Both want to tax companies that move workers abroad and create more jobs and industry right here in America.
* Both want to repeal citizen's united and remove the corrupt superpac money from politics.
* Both want America to quit fighting wars and maintaining wasteful armies across the planet for foreign governments.  Trump was strongly against the Iraq war way back in 2001/2002 and knew only bad things would come out of it, as was Bernie.

Yes, there are still several differences but one can never get 100% of what you desire and I just wanted to let the Bernie supporters know there is a home for you if Hillary and the DNC screw you over.  Trump does care and wants to make everyone in America great and that includes all the Bernie supporters too!

"419","1460829559","If you choose Sanders, that's good choice and it's your right.  But you don't need to justify your decision like this.  CNN to my eyes did a very fair job of handling the debates so far, and their coverage is pretty fair.  Beyond CNN, the media is very heavy handed to Hillary Clinton.  She's got more negative coverage from the liberal media than Sanders does."
"420","1460830371","I disagree with you on multiple fronts about the articles

[First article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-zelizer/index.html) You say CNN ""unabashedly proclaiming Hillary as the clear winner."" What I see is an **opinion** piece  saying that both candidates did well in certain areas but the author thinks Hillary did better at specific policy attacks on Sanders. Not exactly a crazy statement.

[Second article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/clinton-and-sanders-supporters-animosity-opinion-zelizer/index.html) Again an opinion piece, but I think has a lot of merit to it. This is not saying vote for Clinton, its saying that if Sanders wins current climate could turn Clinton voters away from voting for him. I know a lot of people that don't like Sanders, not because they don't like him, but they hate his supporters. They think that Sanders supporters just spam their Facebook walls and insist they just haven't seen the light.

[Third Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/16/politics/bernie-sanders-israel-democratic-politics/index.html) If anything this article praises Sanders for a stance many people have been wanting to make but don't have the balls too. It also brings up the chance that it could backfire if the sentiment isn't taken as positively as he would like. Sounds like an average article to me

[Fourth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/clinton-sanders-views-israel-miller/index.html) Again, an opinion piece. Similarly to the last one its saying to Sanders has taken a very bold and potentially stance on Israel versus Clinton who has taken a very safe stance. Maybe you can call foul at the ""Donald Obama"" part, which I will admit just sounds a bit weird.

[Fifth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/politics/bernie-sanders-jane-sanders-taxes/index.html) Begrudgingly? Is CNN supposed to throw a party because he did released his taxes and unsurprisingly there was nothing interesting in them?

[Sixth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/14/politics/bernie-sanders-religion/index.html) I'm not gonna argue in support of this one too much. I see this one as pandering to your readers, Salon will write articles all day and night asking the question ""Did Hillary flip flop on her stance for Nazi Moon camps"" or something equally ridiculous because certain people eat it up. Its no surprise that CNN does it too.

I feel like a lot of this is just manufactured outrage to maintain the status of the oppressed grass roots little guy, the beacon of light in a dark harbor. Sanders has been doing well the last month or so, and the lack of gains since the wins were in small states can be disappointing. However, it doesnt necessarily mean that there is some sort of massive conspiracy against Sanders. CNN wants a close race, that would make them a lot more money. 
   "
"421","1460828576","It is unprecedented to ask a presidential candidate to release the transcripts from private speeches. 

It is the expectation that a presidential candidate will release substantial tax returns. 

Sanders still has not done so - there have been accusations of impropriety surrounding his finances, especially as they relate to his family and wife. 

He's hiding something. It's not hard to release old tax returns. I could do it very quickly, and I am pretty bad at adulting. 

Sanders must either be hiding something, or an incompetent adult. 

Mentioning Obama repeatedly is not something that should be counted against Clinton - Sanders is running on the premise that Obama wasn't a good president. Clinton is running on the premise that he did a good job, especially considering the circumstances. 

Selling herself as 'Obama's third term' is reasonable, both as being the truth and as a political move.  

Trudeau is a prime minister, not a president. He wasn't directly elected by the people. He's part of a parliamentary government. 

Apples and oranges are not the same. 

Also, 80 percent of millenials don't agree with you - maybe 80 percent of millenials on reddit or twitter, but that's not as many of you as you think. 

Polls show that Sanders supporters say they are going to vote for Clinton at the same (or even higher) rate as Clinton supporters said in 2008. 

Also, the idea that the media are in the tank for Hillary is laughable, unless you're blinded by confirmation bias. Studies show that she gets more negative media than any other candidate.

We talk often on reddit about how the boomer's generation let us down. How they spent past their means and didn't think about the future. Well now we have to think about how we want our generation to be remembered.

Are we to be known as the ones who started a new order? An order based on truth and togetherness and respect for all people? An order where wall-street criminals are punished? An order where smoking a plant that makes you giggle doesn't put you in prison?

He said he wanted a ban on assault weapons when he first ran in Vermont, then he dropped it after losing the election. I expected him to have a better thought out position on gun control. 

Hillary also attacked him for not having a clear plan and I was disappointed that he didn't refute that.

People in America and Europe cannot understand living with a neighbor who is dedicated to your destruction.  Yes, you too are committing atrocities, but it is to protect your people.  If America restrains the Isrealis, the Palestinians and the Arab world aren't going to reciprocate with restraint.  That's not how this works.  The presence of other Western Powers is the only thing keeping the Palestinians alive, Isreal would have wiped all of them out long ago without western pressure.  

People who say that shouldn't have to choose between the lesser of two evils don't understand reality.  In general, picking between two evils is all anyone ever does.  I voted twice for Obama, but Obama has done a lot of stuff in office that I am vehemently opposed to.  That doesn't mean I regret voting for him.  He's done a lot of bad stuff, but, on balance, I feel he's a better chief executive than Romney or McCain would be, so I went with him for my vote.  Lesser of two evils, because I have to vote for someone, and no one I could vote for is completely in line with my views.  

Bottom Line: the reality, on the ground, is different than what you get from a western perch through the media.  On the ground, what you do to protect your own is different than what you say you would do when you don't have to confront the daily realities.  "

I admire Bernie's transparency and swiftness to put this argument into the ground as quickly as possible. He set a date and followed through as a leader should.

As mentioned with the very short attention span, the HRC emails seem to be entirely forgotten about right now.

A small Washington firm named Policy Impact Communications helped create a similar group, the Central Asia Caucus, in late 2009.

( two of the several $10,000  donors to the Montana State Democratic Party) . But in the same report it said it **transferred the same amount of money, $43,500 back to the DNC** – .  a technically legal move that effectively obliterates federal limits on donations to the national committee.

And now here we are, he was invited, he did speak and he did meet the Pope. Did anybody actually believe Sanders was lying?

* If it did happen, it was a pity meeting!

People bitch and moan about how we should have gone with a Single Payer, when that was never going to happen politically. 

Modern liberal voters want purity. Which is exactly what you do not get in a democracy. You get compromise and baby steps. Hillary is the candidate that is used to these compromises, which is why she looks so evil to the modern liberal. 

Of course it's because of this purity issue that we now have a majority of state legislatures controlled by republicans, the majority of governors are Republican, and the power of the Republicans in Congress.

Nor is there any basis in the first amendment for extending press rights to corporations but not free speech.

Money as speech?  Okay, but that opens up a *lot* of side-door maneuvers to suppress both freedom of speech and of press.  If money spent to create or disseminate speech is not protected as speech, criticism of the government which requires any resources beyond ""going door to door"" could be limited.

"894","1460826372","&gt;Seven years earlier, on 16 January 1998, Lewinsky’s friend – an older work colleague called Linda Tripp – invited her for lunch at a mall in Washington DC. Lewinsky was 25. They’d been working together at the Pentagon for nearly two years, during which time Lewinsky had confided in her that she’d had an affair with President Bill Clinton. Unbeknown to Lewinsky, Tripp had been secretly recording their telephone conversations – more than 20 hours of them. The lunch was a trap. When Tripp arrived, she motioned behind her and two federal agents suddenly appeared. “You’re in trouble,” they told Lewinsky.

&gt;She was bustled upstairs to a hotel room filled with prosecutors and federal agents. She started to cry. They told her they were investigating claims that President Clinton had sexually harassed a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Jones, and that if Lewinsky didn’t cooperate with them she’d be charged with perjury and jailed for 27 years.

That seems pretty messed up.  So two people engage in a sexual act and one seems to get thrown under the bus?  I think Bill Clinton gets some razzing, but it's crazy how difficult people made her life for something that wasn't just her decision-making.  "

Every wealthy person in Saudi Arabia is a ""Saudi Prince"" in the Saudi ""Royal Family"".  There are [FIFTEEN THOUSAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud) of them.  It's their government service title.

&gt;The family is estimated to be composed of 15,000 members, but the majority of the power and wealth is possessed by a group of only about 2,000.

And many of those have donated to terrorists or sent money to their wayward children who are terrorists, etc.  Just as many Americans have.  Ahem.

But that doesn't make Saudi Arabia, as a sovereign nation, a supporter of 9/11 as a matter of national policy.

The best analogy would be to claim that the US government was behind the bombing of the Oklahoma Federal Building because Timothy McVeigh's dad sent him money for Christmas...and his dad worked for the US Post Office.  Ahem.

That's clearly NOT the same as President Obama ordering the FBI to help McVeigh blow up one of our own buildings, is it?  Not even close.

The same is true of the actual Saudi Royal inner circle...who have been MERCILESS in dealing with Al Qaeda sympathizers over the years.  Beheadings en masse for anyone even remotely connected to AQ on the peninsula or elsewhere.

Which is what both parties, and quite frankly anyone who has paid any attention to this issue since 2001, already know, understand, and realize is a complete non-issue.

She has the FBI investigation looming which is bad enough for an elected politician but for someone *running* it's incredibly precarious. Whether she's guilty of anything or not, the FBI will interview her and try to catch her perjuring herself, which is very often how these things go.

Then we have these transcripts. Which is an impossible spot for her, there's bound to be something in them that is detrimental to her campaign. She can't clean them up and release them because that could cause someone else to come forward to contradict the content with video or something. Not to mention any day they could be leaked (and likely will be). 

Say what you will about Bernie but he is giving her a run for her money and really making her look bad in the primaries. He's a tough opponent to attack without making her look conservative. She's having to move a lot farther to the left than she probably wanted to (TPP, breaking up banks, more explicit rhetoric on income inequality, campaign finance reform, etc.) which will make it harder for her to move back to the center in the general and may come back to haunt her in office.

It would reveal that the massive campaign and super-PAC contributions Clinton has received from Wall Street did indeed, as Sanders has alleged, influence her ability to get tough on Wall Street malfeasance either in Congress or behind closed doors.

It would reveal that Clinton’s policy positions on — for instance — breaking up “too-big-to-fail” banks are almost certainly insincere, as they have been trotted out merely for the purposes of a presidential campaign."""

Obama when asked about Clinton's legal woes,  “I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America’s national security. what I’ve also said is that—and she has acknowledged—that there’s a carelessness, in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes.”

Sound familiar?

Obama says lots of things... 

His comments on Trayvon Martin as the trial was underway.
""My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" Obama said. ""All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves."" America did and Zimmerman was acquitted.

Obama's comments on the justified shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Mr. Obama said. “Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement — guilty of walking while black or driving while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentment and hopelessness.”. Outcome, Ferguson Riots.

In 2011 Obama sided with the Occupy Wall Street movement. 

""American people understand that not everybody's been following the rules,"" he said. ""These days, a lot of folks doing the right thing are not rewarded. A lot of folks who are not doing the right thing are rewarded. That will express itself until 2012 and beyond until people feel they are getting back to old-fashioned American values.""
 The movement went nowhere and caused major property damage where ever it went.

When in Egypt in 2009 speaking in Cairo he pledged, ""to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.""

As the Arab Spring began he commented, ""There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be.""

"1263","1460833959","I have a female friend that's only voting for Hillary because she's a woman. *Sigh.*"
"1264","1460828271","Clearly the solution to the people in government being corrupt and selling their power and influence to rich people is to grant the people in government even more power and influence to peddle.  Not less."
"1265","1460828226","I believe that Clinton has much better positions than Sanders on health care, Wall Street, and fracking.  I don't get donations from those industries yet I agree with her proposals.  Why are you sure that donations from those groups have influenced her?"
"1266","1460827616","tl;dr but according to the number of votes after 10 min it's definitely a pro sanders post."

It's fun and easy, my favorite so far is Eskom.

&gt;The project, by South Africa's state-owned Eskom utility, is intended to address a worsening power shortage. The loan is controversial due to the 26 million tons of CO2 emissions per year that the plant will emit when completed, making it one of the largest single sources of carbon emissions in the world. South Africa has sought U.S. support for the project  from senior levels at the Department and our Ambassador in Pretoria.

[Spoiler, don't worry Eskom got their plant built and got the loan](http://venturesafrica.com/south-africa-opens-first-power-station-in-20-years-in-order-to-end-electricity-crisis/) and the Clinton foundation got a donation.

See how many you can find. My general thought on her e-mails so far is that she spent an awful lot of time monitoring what was being said about her in the press, seems odd for someone who was appointed to the position and not elected..hmm guess she had future plans....she must be hating this primary....

It is interesting getting into a discussion with a Staunch Hillary supporter because they become entrenched when you are only discussing one or two issues. Regardless of the severity these issues are often dismissed as being republican agenda, or trivial. Even something as severe as taking money from special interests is seen as status quo, so why is it a problem? 

So to have a good listing of her record is a great reference tool to have on hand when having a discussion with anyone who supports Hillary. Oh sure you're not likely to even budge the staunchest of supporters, however it is very condemning to see all this together when discussing it with a Hillary supporter who is only voting for her because of either name recognition or because she is a woman. When you present the actual facts it is amazing how quickly people turn to Bernie who haven't drunken too much of the Hillary Koolaid and let go of all sense of reality. 

In addition to what you posted, i been putting together a spreadsheet of all the times that Hillary lied, flip flopped, been associated with someone corrupt, or has done anything questionable that would be indicative to a behavior more closely tied with known corrupt individuals. 

So between these 2 pieces of collected information I feel really good about talking to any fence sitter because I can present a really strong case why Hillary is an extremely bad choice for Americans, only represents special interests, and would only further eliminate the middle class and increase hardships on the poor.

The fact is if Hillary had zero controversy behind her  the media would still have the focus on her over Bernie  because of what Bernie stands for doesn't align to their interests.

This would be like getting upset at Bernie because of the constant praise The Young Turks gives him.   They even go as far as selling merchandise with Bernie as the focus.   It's simply not right to target the candidate over the media's behavior over them."

Additionally, the DNC is aware that no extremist, liberal or conservative, has won a general election in recent memory. The last time a liberal was nominated it was Mondale. That wasn't a good result. If your memory doesn't include that unpleasant bit of history, no worries. You are about to see the same thing on the GOP side this cycle. They will get *crushed*.

And deservedly so, most of the people in this country are moderates. Which is why the DNC favors, and will nominate, a moderate.

&gt; The challenges facing our planet are not mainly technological or even financial, because as a world we are rich enough to increase our investments in skills, infrastructure, and technological know-how to meet our needs and to protect the planet. Our challenge is mostly a moral one, to redirect our efforts and vision to the common good.

If it wasn't for unions fighting the ""job creators"" we would be working seven days a week from the age of ten until we died. There is something wrong with that. The fact that wages were allowed to stay so low, all while corporate profits and equity markets soared prove there is a problem. If the lowest paid workers among us get paid wages that are below poverty levels. Then every single one us will be paid less. Maybe the price of goods and services would rise with an increase in the minimum wage, but I guarantee that those price increases don't outpace the rise in wages.

"1574","1460739497","If you're interested in some insight into what capitalism really is and why it prevails, take a look at ""The New Spirit of Capitalism"" by Boltanski and Chiapello. 
One aspect to think about: Capitalism is a system without inherent ethic values, more so it lends them from the outside system. Which makes it adaptable in a way that it changes it's form when faced with criticism. 
In harsh words: we will not overcome the system ""capitalism"" in any way anytime soon, we won't change its ""heart"", only it's face."

"1576","1460764348","So a lot of people here are raising the good point of how since adopting capitalism the world has lifted many out of poverty and we've seen vast technological developments. As you praise capitalism, I encourage you to also take a step back. Look at the larger picture and in a more a abstract sense, try and dissect what capitalism is and why it's been successful. It's not that capitalism is some magic wand, it's a system that has underlying mechanisms which have brought us this growth. Ask yourself what those mechanisms are, and how we can strengthen those mechanisms. At the same time, look at the problems it has been unable to solve, and how we can fix that. Because while we've seen great growth, you can't deny the crummy materialistic consumer culture it promotes through constant manipulative advertisements to sell us products we don't actually need, and the amount of environmental damage we've caused for the sake of cost savings and convenience.

To me, what I believe has made capitalism successful is that it distributed power. It gave people much more control over their lives and their communities, where previously the decision making had come from the top down and people had mostly pre defined roles. It was too rigid. The people making the decisions were too far removed to even know what was going on or how their decisions affected the people, and obviously those making the decisions have their own interests held above others. Capitalism smashed this idea at first, but it hasn't solved it. Time and time again, our economic power gets concentrated again in the hands of the few, and the engine stalls."

I use that example because normally a liberal desires *complete equality* and the only way to gain parity for the cannabis issue is to remove cannabis as a Scheduled drug **at all**.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7vrgwbS074


It is crushing to hear the world-known activist listing all the oppression in Honduras, how the illegal coup was carried out to benefit the oligarchs, how Hillary Clinton was the main thrust behind legitimizing the military coup, how her friends are getting assassinated for standing up to the foreign special interests that toppled Zelaya's government, the list of issues/demands the poor in Honduras are dying for...

... but most crushingly... she predicted her death and was fearful then for her life (before getting assassinated by the coup heirs to power in Honduras). She did not care... she was going to continue to fight on for justice and for the people of Honduras who don't have Hillary an email away to shill for their interests (unlike the oligarchs)."
"1723","1460750718","Just in case anyone's interested in a more nuanced take, including arguments for why the coup was actually a legal transfer of power (though maybe carried out illegally) and the surprising fact that people on the right criticized Hillary at the time for *opposing* the new government, here's some stuff I pulled together in a discussion on another forum:

First, criticism from the [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204518504574423570828980800) for not supporting the coup/transfer of power:
&gt;Ever since Manuel Zelaya was removed from the Honduran presidency by that country's Supreme Court and Congress on June 28 for violations of the constitution, the Obama administration has insisted, without any legal basis, that the incident amounts to a ""coup d'état"" and must be reversed....""The administration is standing by its ""coup"" charge and 10 days ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went so far as to sanction the country's independent judiciary. The U.S. won't say why, but its clear the court's sin is rejecting a U.S.-backed proposal to restore Mr. Zelaya to power....""Since June 28, the U.S. has been pressuring Honduras to put Mr. Zelaya back in the presidency. But neither Mrs. Clinton's spurious ""rule of law"" claims or the tire iron handed her by Mr. Obama to use against this little country have been effective in convincing the Honduran judiciary that it ought to abandon its constitution.""

Then, apparently the idea that the removal of Zelaya from office (though not his exile from the country, and perhaps not the way it was done) was legal and constitutional has a lot of support. (So does the idea that it wasn't, of course.) Here are some examinations of it, pro and con: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27état#Legality_of_ouster), [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2009/0721/p09s02-wogn.html), [CNN](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-295913).

That last is by Miguel Estrada, whom some of you may remember as a George Bush nominee to the US Court of Appeals who was rejected for being a conservative ideologue. So take it with however much salt you need. He is Honduran himself, though, and that article offers the most detailed account of Zelaya's actions that allegedly led to his ouster."
"1724","1460765072","God damnit. Read Wiki on this people.

President 1 tries to pass legislation illegally to make himself dictator.  
Honduras Supreme Court says stop, that's illegal, he doesn't stop.   
Honduras asks the US if they support ousting the guy trying to become dictator.  We say yes.  Honduras congress ousts him, has military escort him to airport and ban him from country.  
The guy replacing him then passes the legislation and makes himself dictator.  

K?  Got it?

Now let's all call Hillary evil for her major role in ousting a good, honest man and replacing him with a dictator.  Yay!  Facts don't matter!!"
"1725","1460734295","Clinton is a war hawk with the blood of thousands on her hands already. Electing her president will just continue this pattern of spreading death and destruction around the globe. More money for military contractors and war profiteers, none for infrastructure, renewable energy, universal single payer healthcare, and education.

We have to break this cycle and with the president controlling the executive branch, not electing Clinton is the most effective way to do this. Sanders would crush in the general election and his willingness to say no to more irration action like what happened in Honduras can make more of a difference than most are willing to acknowledge."
"1726","1460744738","Not quite, here's a less biased view from the Washington Post:
""Instead of condemning the figures behind the uprising, suspending support to the illegitimate government of Zelaya’s successor, Roberto Micheletti, and demanding a restoration of the democratically elected Zelaya, Secretary Clinton decided to move on. In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region “to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.” The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya’s ouster.""

They want to encourage companies to grow rather than just give the money to shareholders. Shareholders like this because it increases the value of the company and boosts their share value (which gets taxed when they sell). Without that it would be more likely that companies would pay out the money as dividends and cut back on buying new equipment or expanding.

There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window. I highly doubt that a candidate like Clinton will be elected again, but who knows

In the FISMA report, the Office of Inspector General will cite weaknesses to enterprise-wide security they consider to be a significant deficiency in accordance with OMB M-11-33. **The Department acknowledges the weaknesses identified by the OIG, but does not agree that any of the findings, either individually or collectively, rise to the level of a significant deficiency that would require treating the matter as an additional material weakness in accordance with OMB M-11-33 which states “a significant deficiency is defined as a weakness in an agency’s overall information systems security program... that significantly restricts the capability of the agency to carry out its mission or compromises the security of its information, information systems, personnel, or other resources, operations, or assets. In this context, the risk is great enough that the agency head and other agencies must be notified and immediate or near-immediate action must be taken.”**

1.    Was she reimbursed for the cost of her email server and support services by the State Department.
2.    Was her server included in the Federal Information Systems Inventory (Required by OMB A-130, among others places.)
3.    Was her server included in the State Department's annual audits and reviews for compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, and were there any findings relevant to her server.
4.    Did she withhold information about her server to prevent it from being included in these audits or discussions with auditors and the Inspector General.


As an auditor, who would very likely communicate with executives through email, or at least see executive emails as evidence of the performance of certain control activities, it would be trivial to show that her email was not connected to the other agency systems in the Audit Reports and the required underlying documentation, if her server was not included in the audit and required risk management processes.

It's so hard to tell what's really going on at a geopolitical level, but Hillary's legitimization of the new Honduran regime just seems super suspect to me.

Our allies wanted nothing to do with the election, because it was a sham - 

&gt;While observers were touched by the commitment, courage and enthusiasm of the many Hondurans who participated in this process in good faith, they were also saddened by the numerous discrepancies, lack of preparedness and resources, bribery, voter intimidation, violence and fraud that they witnessed.

1) HC had some conflict of interest to support the coup leaders. I can't begin to guess what but I guess Obama did too, since ultimately it was his call.  

2) HC was naive enough to think the leaders of a coup would be sure to run a free and fair election.  Or, let's say it wasn't a coup, she was naive enough to think the kind of people who would issue a secret warrant, arrest the elected President in the middle of the night in his pajamas and extradite him in violation of their own constitution would be sure to run a free and fair elections.

"2048","1460770154","This is a repost about the US involvement in regime change in Honduras -   
  
&gt;Dude, it's Honduras. They have by far the highest homicide rate out of any country in the world. More than half as many people are murdered there per year than in the United States, even though their population is only 8.5 million. Their GDP per capita is about $2400 per year, making them one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere.  
  

&gt;Honduras wasn't going to turn into a utopia if the US government cut off much needed aid, which was not required by law, because it was not a military coup, and normal constitutional and electoral function resumed very quickly afterwards. The supreme court was legally entitled to order the president out of office.
  
  
&gt;The real goal in a situation like that is to avoid a civil war, which was a very real possibility. And if the US had taken a strong stance against the new government, and war broke out, they would have been obligated to intervene. That point cannot be stressed enough.
  
  
&gt;To drive that point home, I will give you an example of how you can really fuck that kind of thing up.
  
  
&gt;At the end of the Gulf War in 1991, anybody that had anything to do with the military or foreign relations in the US government was badly in need of a vacation. Thousands people who normally work 40 hours a week had been working 70 hours a week for six months, and more than half a million US military personnel had been in full war mode for even longer.
  
  
&gt;Time to take a breather, right?
  
  
&gt;Wrong. Really wrong.
  
  
&gt;At that exact point in history, the USSR was collapsing. So no time off for anyone.
And in that context, the US made some rather subtle mistakes in their messaging, which is understandable. Unfortunately, as a result, the Iraqi Kurds got the impression that the US would support them of they rose up against Saddam.   
  
  
&gt;But the coalition had avoided invading Iraq precisely because they had achieved their objectives, and didn't want to get caught up in Iraq's ethnic squabbles.
  
  
&gt;The Kurdish uprising was subsequently brutally crushed.
  
  
&gt;It was a lesson for future US administrations. If you give even tacit support for a resistance movement, they might expect you to help them.
  
  
&gt;So when Honduras happened, they kept their mouths shut, and maintained the status quo.
Since you are clearly passionate about this (which I appreciate) I would ask you what you would have done if you were the president of the US when that happened.
  
  
&gt;Keep in mind that at that exact moment, the following things were demanding attention and resources from the Whitehouse:
  
  
&gt;-There were 135,000 troops in Iraq. There were also 50,000 in Afghanistan, where the violence was spiralling out of control.
  
  
&gt;-The global financial crisis was still a huge issue, and the US economy was struggling badly. People were abandoning their homes in large numbers, and tent cities were becoming a common sight in major cities.
    
  
&gt;-The ACA battle, which was to be Obama's signature legislative achievement as President, was in a critical stage.
  
  
&gt;-The Tea Party movement had picked up real steam. People were bringing assault rifles to protests, and talking openly about overthrowing the government by force.
  
  
&gt;-The new H1N1 virus was spreading rapidly in the US. By the end of the year, it would kill more than 3,000 Americans, and put more than 25,000 in hospital, making it more substantial in terms of human damage than either Pearl Harbour or September 11th. "

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "

Great movements in America have always required being human before being a politician. Hillary is getting huge sums of money for being a Clinton.  She says she represents the people,  but she isn't talking about her ideas. She criticizes Bernie's ideas, and tries to find loopholes. When I watch her, it almost seems like she is arguing in court trying to use long articulated sentences while replying to simple questions.   She acts like what's done is done, and that these changes Bernie speaks of shouldn't be attempted.  In the 1700s, England was in its prime, and mighty.  The colonists were at their mercy, yet they stood up, and fought for what they believed in despite the situation being ""imlossible."" When Lincoln dropped the emancipation proclamation on the world, much of the United States didn't support this, he was even assassinated.  Here we are now.

You see it when she begins a sentence with, ""I've always"" or ""my entire life"" or ""I've never"". It's simply not possible for a person to have always held a simple position on a complex issue such as the second amendment, social security, abortion. There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur.""

"2177","1460745130","ITT: people that don't realize that Bernie's losing "
"2178","1460739546","I like how the main issue anyone has with Bernie is that he doesn't have a fully laid out plan on how to handle certain situations.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

Why is it seen as a negative that Bernie Sanders couldn't specify differences between his and Trump's stance on NATO? If anything, to me, it shows that this is one issue that both parties can agree to cooperate and actually do something about since their beliefs are similar on this topic.

I personally don't think that because Bernie Sanders agrees with one side of the republican policies, that democrats should see that as a negative. To me, thats a positive. It shows someone finally thinking outside of the box and being open minded instead of trying to progress this country baby steps at a time the way Hillary wants.

"2182","1460732819","how exactly did he ""win"" last night? he had a rubio moment when hillary pointed out that she wanted to take steps to address climate change while bernie has failed to even take a first step in the senate. ""we have a crisis! we have a crisis! we have a crisis!""

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."

&gt;It's that in the history of political rhetoric, no one has ever been inspired by a pragmatist...What Sanders has going for him is that Democrats want to believe in his vision. And when people are asked to choose between their dreams and hard realities, they tend to pick their dreams.

I'm a fairly realistic person so to pragmatism of Hillary really speaks to me.

Not caring if Sanders supporters, read Progressives, ""flake out"" on Clinton isn't actually the biggest worry that the Democrats have. Their peril is three-fold:

First, they risk losing Senate and House seats in swing districts to Republicans, areas that are winnable if overall turnout is high, but are vulnerable to an ""enthusiasm"" gap if negative campaigning drives moderate voters and independents away from the polls.

Second, they face the prospect of losing local, state, and federal seats to left-leaning third parties and independent candidacies in their most democratic districts. The assumption that voters will either vote the Democratic ticket, or ""flake out"" is wildly optimistic. Angry voters with the option to vote for local third party candidates without creating any risk of Republican victories could install public officials to the left of the Democrats in many constituencies nationwide.

Third, in most places the Democratic and Republican nominees will not be the only names on the ballot. Perhaps the party loyalists should ask Al Gore for advice on underestimating the impact that a small percentage of ""protest votes"" can have in a swing state where Republicans have repeatedly engaged in voter suppression.

The smart move is for the party to back a move to standardize primary election procedures throughout the country for future election cycles, and to establish strict transparency and disclosure rules for candidates and lobbyists or PACs of all types associated with the party and set a standard clearly higher than the Republicans. For the sake of preserving a ""big tent"" fifty state strategy in 2016 and beyond, the Democrats should embrace these reforms at their Convention regardless of which candidate wins their nomination for the Presidency."

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

- What the hell is with Bernie's taxes? There is tons and tons of precedent for candidates releasing all of their taxes. Why is he being so shady about it? His excuses are lame and shouldn't be accepted"

"2326","1460731742","No, it was basically a tie.  A tie isn't enough right now.  What killed him was not being able to tie Clinton taking money from Wall Street to any actions she has done.  "
"2327","1460751991","﻿ I have disagreed with Paul Krugman's blogs about Bernie Sanders--his faulty analysis of the Daily News interview, and his sneering depiction of Sanders at every turn as in ""the revolutionary isn't cute any more."" His inability to say anything positive about the man, such as his passion, vision, his consistency, his strength in Congress sponsoring and co-sponsoring bills (across the aisle and with Sec. Clinton), his resonance with many, many voters, any of his policies. This indicates to me not reasoned, authentic political thinking, but a smear campaign. But today Paul Krugman and I agree on something. I found it deeply disturbing that in the Brooklyn debate last night that Sanders reiterated his remark that he lost the South because it's conservative. He lost among African American voters. His remark effectively dismisses them as conservatives, and that's a problem. I don't think the remark accurately reflects his positions and actions concerning systemic racism in this country. But he should hear the problem in his remark and stop saying it, and say why he was wrong to say it. I have been pondering why many African Americans in the Southern primaries (including in my small Virginian town) voted for Clinton. Of course, there are multiple reasons and points of view. But I don't think it has been conservativism. And I don't think it's necessarily affection for the Clintons. People I know said, ""She's electable."" I think African American voters deeply understand the gravity of the situation, more than most white voters probably. A white friend in a predominantly Black union in Philadelphia said that when she asked the question, people said, ""Bernie who?"" The longer the campaign goes on, the more people will be able to answer that question. But Bernie Sanders needs to understand what's wrong with calling a predominantly African American vote (in my town almost all Democrats are Black and almost all Republicans are white) ""conservative."" And he needs to fix it, publicly."
"2328","1460753760","I watched the debate and I am blown away by Sanders.  He did amazing and I want to do everything I can to support him.

&gt;    The evidence suggests that if there is police racial bias in arrests it is negligible. Victim and witness surveys show that police arrest violent criminals in close proportion to the rates at which criminals of different races commit violent crimes.

&gt;    There are dramatic race differences in crime rates. Asians have the lowest rates, followed by whites, and then Hispanics. Blacks have notably high crime rates. This pattern holds true for virtually all crime categories and for virtually all age groups.

&gt;    In 2013, a black was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder, and 12 times more likely to murder someone of another race than to be murdered by someone of another race.

&gt;    In 2013, of the approximately 660,000 crimes of interracial violence that involved blacks and whites, blacks were the perpetrators 85 percent of the time. This meant a black person was 27 times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. A Hispanic was eight times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa.

&gt;    In 2014 in New York City, a black was 31 times more likely than a white to be arrested for murder, and a Hispanic was 12.4 times more likely. For the crime of “shooting” — defined as firing a bullet that hits someone — a black was 98.4 times more likely than a white to be arrested, and a Hispanic was 23.6 times more likely.

&gt;    If New York City were all white, the murder rate would drop by 91 percent, the robbery rate by 81 percent, and the shootings rate by 97 percent.

&gt;    In an all-white Chicago, murder would decline 90 percent, rape by 81 percent, and robbery by 90 percent.

&gt;    In 2015, a black person was 2.45 times more likely than a white person to be shot and killed by the police. A Hispanic person was 1.21 times more likely. These figures are well within what would be expected given race differences in crime rates and likelihood to resist arrest.

&gt;    In 2015, police killings of blacks accounted for approximately 4 percent of homicides of blacks. Police killings of unarmed blacks accounted for approximately 0.6 percent of homicides of blacks. The overwhelming majority of black homicide victims (93 percent from 1980 to 2008) were killed by blacks.

&gt;    Both violent and non-violent crime has been declining in the United States since a high in 1993. 2015 saw a disturbing rise in murder in major American cities that some observers associated with “depolicing” in response to intense media and public scrutiny of police activity.

"2377","1460826386","There is an argument to be made that the new crime wave didn't appear *because* we began applying stricter incarceration and police protocols, saying we should scrap them because the crime rate went down is like saying you don't need river levees because you haven't had any floods.

&gt; The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also won’t explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

&gt; ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

&gt; ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

&gt; Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldn’t get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

Nides was also involved in the [scandal](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/12/ethics_complaint_seeks_to_uncover_facts_in_hillary_influencepeddling_scandal.html) involving Clinton’s efforts to provide special access to State Department officials for hedge fund clients of her son-in-law, Marc Mezinsky.

Wow.

Edit*  If anybody is wondering about the investment remarks, it is on page 21 of the files [here.](http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/defs-document-production-march-7-2016/)"
"2454","1460750890","&gt;Judicial Watch announced today it has obtained new documents from the Department of State containing the telephone transcripts from the evening of September 11, 2012, in which then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informs then-Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil that the deadly terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi “had nothing to do with the film.”  The documents include previously unreleased telephone transcripts with world leaders about the Benghazi attack.

&gt;Clinton’s admission to Kandil was first produced to the Select Committee on Benghazi on October 13, 2015 and publicized on the day of Mrs. Clinton’s testimony, October 22, but court filings in Judicial Watch litigation show that the record was only produced after two federal court judges ordered the State Department to produce more Benghazi-related records to Judicial Watch.  Similarly, Judicial Watch litigation also forced the release of the September 11, 2012 email in which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed her daughter by email that the attack had been staged by an “Al Qaeda-like group,” rather than as the result of “inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” as Mrs. Clinton had claimed in her official public statement one hour earlier."

"2462","1460750972","what is it proving? are you kidding me, she said it was a video to all the families of the dead they went on talk shows and said it was a video they said it was a video for weeks when they knew it was a planed attack the next day. who gave the stand down order that killed our people that's what we want to know

Well for one it puts the lie to her claims that Benghazi was touched off by the video, which is what she and her envoys preached for weeks afterward, including to the families of the dead.

At 10:08 p.m. on September 11, Mrs. Clinton issued an official State Department press statement, approved by the White House, placing the blame for the attack on an Internet video:

...

Yet the next day, in her 7:49 PM September 12 conversation with 
Kandil, Clinton said, “We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do 
with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest.” Kandil 
responded, “You’re not kidding. Based on the information we saw today we
believe that group that claimed responsibility for this is affiliated 
with al-Qaeda.”

So by the very next evening she was talking to world leaders and telling them they knew it wasn't about a video. It was terrorism, straight up. But they changed the talking points to hide the terrorism angle because it was an election year and Obama had been running on the platform that al Qaeda and other terror orgs were ""on the run.""

It was a baldfaced lie told to the American people, and it was told so Obama could retain the White House and Hillary could still pretend that Libya was a feather in her cap for 2016, instead of a miserable failure."

"2486","1460784494","The most believable theory I've heard is that she's been indicating her candidacy at private speeches before her official announcement. "
"2487","1460783606","If it's nothing, then let it loose.  It'll make everyone look foolish for grasping at the straw.

If it's just embarrassing or inconvenient or such, let it loose, get it out and over with, and move on.

Which means that it's the third:  It's a powerful problem, and they're not letting it go, lest it wrecks the campaign... which itself will wreck the campaign because it won't be ignored or forgotten. 

If she thinks that the GOP, much less Bernie, is gonna let that slide... yeah, that's just dumb hope on her part.

I think it's bad news for her campaign, honestly.  But the only way to know is to get 'em out there."
"2488","1460793148","We pretty much know what Hillary said in those speeches. [Various people who attended those private speeches has been interviewed by the media, and they described those speeches as the gushy.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/clinton-speeches-218969) Some reported that she sound like a managing director. We know that in those speeches she definitely did not go and tell them to cut it out. Before Sanders and Trump, taking money from Wall Street was just par for the course. Everyone on the GOP did it and Hillary probably did it less than all of them, so it was no big deal. But then Sanders and Trump came around, and all of a sudden those speeches became completely toxic. 

So I am pretty sure that is exactly the smoking gun we are looking for. Not like secret promises to work with them for favors or anything. But like, ""you guys are heroes, you help drive this economy and are a big reason why America is the great country that it is."" Stuff like that. Empty platitudes in the past, but will sink her campaign now. We know that is at least in there, and that is probably good enough. 

If she say anything about running for president or become the future president, that is illegal and we can pack up and go home. I personally don't think that is in there, cause she is a lawyer by trade and would not do something so stupid. If there is a Freudian slip, which is entirely possible, then she is in some real shit. 

Here is my biggest worry. Those speeches were pretty public events, each had thousands of people attending, and she made a lot of them. So it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a recording out there somewhere. this is completely expected. I am worried that someone is waiting to release them in the general election. I know trump would put up a million dollar bounty for a recording, and frankly i think they are sitting on one already. 

This combined with the active FBI investigation into her emails which already shows she has been at least careless with classified material. We are just waiting to see if that carelessness adds up to negligence or gross negligence. 

The amount of risk the DNC is taking with Hillary is unimaginable with anyone else. Frankly it is amazing the democratic establishment has allowed it to get this far. "
"2489","1460784097","Quality of content aside, it just looks bad and her deflection attempts make it look worse. Waiting on Bernie's speeches, then Trump's, then their taxes, and whatever's next. It's ridiculous."
"2490","1460784597","/u/JoyceCarolOatmeal wrote an interesting hypothesis earlier, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4exj0t/release_of_clintons_wall_street_speeches_could/d248zh5?context=3)."
"2491","1460784642","Same reason Hillary had to delete her emails: the contents of which would be more damaging than the flak she's taking for refusing to release them. 
"
"2492","1460783973","I'd say it's fairly likely, otherwise why not simply release the transcripts? We already know that in prior speeches she blamed the ""irresponsible borrowers"" for the 2008 crash rather than the banks buying bad loans that they knew were made by predatory loan officers. I can't imagine the rest of her speeches are really that good.

Even if she was just blowing smoke up their asses, it won't appear that way to the public."
"2493","1460785667","At this point all the damage that can be dealt from her not releasing them has been dealt.

 And if she does release them, even if there's nothing particularly damming in them, literally every single word will be pried apart and any sentence in any context that could possibly be construed as ""bad"" will be prime ammunition against her, even if it's not that big of a deal.

Releasing them now, regardless of what's in them, would be a strategically unsound move for that reason.

 That's why she just tosses out a lame excuse she knows will be unpopular. Because she knows that not releasing them can only possibly hurt her so much, and right now it's about as much as it can get. But releasing them, regardless of their contents, opens up the floodgates for *new* controversy"
"2494","1460785279","You don't continue to withhold and make ridiculous requirements in order to release them without there being something damaging on them. There is no other logical reason to withhold them at this point. She was booed on stage. She has to be aware of the negativity she is getting from them. That is why I believe what ever is on them is worse. You don't take damage unless it's necessary."
"2495","1460783343","You have to be incredibly naive to believe that someone with her experience and legal background would be daft enough to make seriously damaging statements. I have attended lots of these (boring) events over the years. The speakers always are aware that someone could be recording it. The real action occurs in the private one-on-one conversations  afterwards in the mixers. Thats why you pay the big buck to attend or have the person there: access. The speech is just puffery.  "
"2496","1460786021","It's illegal to give paid speeches if you're running for president. If in one of those speeches she said something to the effect of 'she'll protect the banks when she's elected' she is fucking done."
"2497","1460783948","See also: ""why wouldn't Mitt Romney release his tax returns"""
"2498","1460784099","There's no point in giving Bernie ammo that plays right into his stump speech rhetoric, especially when she's clearly winning.

She got paid the same amount to give speeches to Ebay, Beth El Synagogue, and *The American Camping Association*, but no one is clamoring for those.  It's people latching on to the Bernie ""Wall Street = automatically in league with the anti-Christ"" logic.

It's cliche corporate retreat fluff where they pay a big name to come wow people with his/her life story and throw some cheap compliments to the employees there.

She knows if she releases the Wall Street related ones every platitude is going to parsed and twisted out of context.

Or if you are on r/politics you think they were literal 225k bribes and Hillary and Goldman Sachs were all sitting in a room laughing at poor people for two hours."
"2499","1460827150","To me, this is like Romney and his tax returns.  No matter what she said in those speeches, I know there's a logical argument that could convince me to ignore her statements.

1.) to keep the pressure on and keep talking about these subjects and not let the media push them into the shadows again.
2.) to aggressively challenge any and all voter dis-enfranchisements. Voting should be a constitutional right! Americans should have the right to vote in a fair process free of party corruptions, free of gerrymandering, and free of false choices between 'lesser of two evils'. How to accomplish that technically?

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.  
e.) All states should switch to vote by mail.
f.) Each ballot should have a durable carbon copy record for auditing purposes that shall remain legible at least 10 years in the humid Southeast.
g.) Vote tallying or counting machines must be audited regularly and rigorously using statistical sampling. "

Citing hundreds of thousands of annual marijuana arrests, racial and economic disparities in marijuana enforcement, and the role of prohibition in keeping marijuana prices high and lucrative to violent drug dealers, the physicians say that creating a legal and regulated marijuana market is the best way to ensure public safety, combat the illicit drug trade and roll back the negative consequences of strict enforcement policies on disadvantaged communities."

Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change.

"2944","1460712638","There are a lot of comments here about how much people don't trust Hillary Clinton. They do trust Bernie Sanders. He has a lot of support with NYT readers. 

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

"2953","1460703012","You can almost understand what she is saying: *if a left-wing Dem congress put a $15 federal minimum wage bill on her desk*, she would sign it. But she doesn't believe the political will is there, so she won't advocate or fight for it, because that's not ""pragmatic"" or politically viable.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

The Clinton revolution was basically founded on ""New Dems"" newfound role as hippie punchers, so triangulating against a hippie is making Hillary sound increasingly schizophrenic."
"2954","1460692526","She looked so bad in this answer because it truly seemed like she was trying to mislead people into thinking she's for a $15 federal minimum wage. If that's not what you're for just explain your stance please."
"2955","1460719015","it seemed like a fairly straight forward answer. Her stance is to push for a federal minimum of $12. If a bill somehow passes for $15, she is more than happy to sign it. 

But the bill she would put forward to congress if there isn't already legislation in the works, is $12"
"2956","1460692438","Hilary is very confusing and obtuse in her answers."
"2957","1460694201","At least she gave a long diatribe on why @12 minimum is a step toward $15.  She couldn't give one reason for why she would oppose breaking up big banks.  Instead she refused to answer the question, repeatedly.  Then she claimed that it wasn't ""fair"" to ask her to release her $200,000  Wall St. speech transcripts because the ""other candidate"" won't.  We all know Bernie has no Wall St speeches but she is pretending otherwise. She will say anything no matter how ridiculous to win. "
"2958","1460723100","You have to be pretty dense to not understand her minimum wage argument. 12 as a baseline and a push for 15 in places that can handle economically. How is that hard?"
"2959","1460721331","Not confusing if you understand how the world works. Same with converting to renewables. You have to make huge changes in phases, otherwise you get very bad side effects.  You can't just jack up minimum wage to 15 everywhere (nor should you as the cost of living in Manhattan and San Francisco is WAY different from places like Alabama and Montana ) immediately without bad consquences."
"2960","1460705894","There was nothing confusing about it at all. She's in favor of a federal, nationwide minimum wage of $12. She's in favor of higher minimum wages in states and cities like New York where the cost of living is higher."
"2961","1460709046","Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"
"2962","1460715245","I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."
"2963","1460720963","The answer seems weird but it makes sense when you consider how hard it is to get any legislation to the desk of the president. I'm sure Hillary's first choice would be a $12 national minimum wage, but if congress were to pass a $15 dollar one I'm sure she wouldn't veto it. It makes perfect sense."
"2964","1460725471","I'm a Bernie supporter, but this is where I agree with Clinton. I believe $12 is a fair minimum wage nationally. Some areas like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco need more. However, I think $15 nationally is too high. Some 15 year old kid in bumfuck Nebraska doesn't need $15 an hour. It could dry up jobs and push automation along faster."

She did the same shit with her answer about carbon taxing, and a similar thing with her nonanswer about whether Israel's bombing of Gaza was disproportionate (a fair yes or no question).

 She doesn't even want to say clearly what she believes when it's about a divisive issue because any clear answer is bound to piss off some group of people, so she mealy mouths her answers and tries to have it both ways. It's goddamn infuriating to listen to."
"2968","1460714202","What's so confusing? It was pretty clear: if you support the $15 min wage, then I support the $15 min wage, if you support the $12 min wage, them I support the $12 min wage.

He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

Yes, it's condescending. Yes,  it's denying some people what they want. But I don't see how her obvious lie and dodge is benefiting her, particularly as she has to repeat it over and over.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus?

How is someone living paycheck to paycheck supposed to get the time off, childcare, etc. to go vote in three different primaries?

The sense of entitlement is sickening.  They could have just chosen a nominee and bypasses having primaries and caucuses altogether.  The caucus system shuts out people who don't have hours to spare but I hardly saw any complaining here because it benefitted Sanders.  The hypocrisy is incredible.  "
"3109","1460736782","So now we're going to actually question the state deadline instead of just laughing and calling Trump's children incompetent for not switching to Republican in time. Why aren't we calling these 3 million people incompetent? Hypocrisy. "

But the problem is that merely wishing or pointing out how absurd it is does nothing to change it. What does change it is knowing these rules, and then voting in spite of them. The only way these rules will ever change is to know them, follow them, and then vote for candidates who promote something simpler, something more democratic, something more open. The only way voting will *ever* become a national holiday, is if enough voters without a national holiday demand one. Pointing out the flaws isn't enough, nor was it ever enough. Sitting there with high-minded principles does nothing.

The obstinate stupidity of this man, combined with self righteous indignity, can only lead to disaster. This is a secular country, that was the main attraction early on, even before we called it America. It was a place to escape persecution for being different. Quakers, shakers, puritans, etc. Everyone that was not part of the main church ruled by the king of wherever, was in danger until they escaped their homelands and got here. Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country. Our founders wanted the soldier's, and the king's taxes, out. It was not about establishing a Christian nation. They drank, they whored, they swore. They were men. Normal men.

Ted Cruz however scares me shitless. It would be a step backwards to elect him. We'd have more religious tension discrimination than we already do. Even as a conservative leaning voter, i would never vote for Cruz. I'm economically/fiscally conservative but socially liberal. And Ted Cruz is the exact opposite. He's like Hillary Clinton except he wants to carpet bomb places is Iraq, ban gay marriage &amp;amp; abortion. Won't believe a word of climate change and is too deluded by his religion to be a rationale leader for the majority. And also he's the zodiac killer. "

If we let a republican president replace Scalia and Ginsberg, we can look forward to a reversal of Roe v Wade, reversal of gay marriage, overturn of the ACA, final destruction of unions and indivduals' rights to due process, and supremacy of business above all to an irreversible level."

Why? Why would I vote for someone who has talked down to me at every turn only to turn around and pander to me when she needs my vote? She did that shit in the south to black people and now that they're out....well Bill has been running his mouth and she's playing damage control. 

She hasn't been for me or any of my fellow Bernie supporters and mocks us on a regular basis but yeah...I'm totally gonna vote for you in the general. You know who else mocked us? Trump.

&gt; (APPLAUSE)

&gt; ... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.

&gt; I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just don’t accept that.

&gt; What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.

&gt; And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.

She is running in the Democratic primary, not the general election. The only other campaign in the Democratic primary is that of Bernie Sanders, and he faces the same scrutiny that she does - he just doesn't have any transcripts to release!

So this talk of 'fairness' is a bullshit cop out. Terribly irresponsible, tremendously un-presidential. Now that Bernie is releasing his tax returns they have no argument to fall back on. "

The problem is that, even she would admit that the oil company pours TONS of money to different GOP candidates, and that is why the GOP denies climate change up and down.  The problem is that by her taking money she is participating in a broken/rigged system.  She is not standing up to it, even if it doesn't change her vote, it's changing many others votes and it's the reason this country is not moving forward.

That being said.  It totally changes her vote."

How does this change anything? The transcripts are to establish whether or not there is a conflict of interest. Why would people make this into a petty ""omg you go first"" argument? They can both be guilty, so why wouldn't you all expect to see both things? 

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

Neither should Sanders. He claims that his wife handles the taxes, and that is good and fine, but if that's true there is no reason why she can't fly to Vermont grab em' and fly back.

Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said.

&gt;There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health.

"3553","1460817578","[Link](https://www.scribd.com/doc/308299698/Cavanaugh-v-Bartelt) to the case.  

In looking up this case, it appears that the plaintiff, Stephen W. Cavanaugh, brought this case as pro se plaintiff meaning he had no legal representation.  This case, in my opinion, was decided incorrectly and with adequate counsel should be reversed on appeal and allowed to progress.  The Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to 10(b)(6).

While I couldn't read the Complaint, it appears that Cavanaugh sued prison officials pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages because he was denied (1) access to wear religious clothing; (2) ability to congregate for weekly worship services and classes; and (3) right to receive communion.  The prison officials denied his requests because they concluded that ""FSMism was a parody religion.""

The Court goes through a lengthy historical detail regarding evolution and briefly discusses the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  While I do not have access to the motion to dismiss, I imagine the arguments made within are parroted in this decision in whole.  It ultimately holds that the religion is in fact a parody before analyzing the legal arguments.

Cavanaugh's claims: (1) Violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of religion of the US Constitution; (2) Article I, §4 of the Nebraska Constitution; (3) Equal Protection provisions of the US Constitution; and (4) Article I, §3 of the Nebraska Constitution.  The Court construed the Complaint as raising a claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) U.S.C. §2000cc.

The Court first analyzed RLUIPA which requires protection against government action when the government's conduct imposes (1) a substantial burden (2) on a religious exercise.  In analyzing the ""religious exercise,"" the Court held that RLUIPA may only be raised to protect sincere religious beliefs and not secular ways of life.  The Court essentially rules that FSMism is not a religion but a parody, and equates the religious  texts to that of Jonathan Swift's ""Modest Proposal"" which advocates cannibalism.  Ruling that FSMism is not a religion, it is not awarded protection under RLUIPA.

There is no cause of action for money damages under RLUIPA against state officials acting in their official capacities, so the claim is barred by sovereign immunity.  Thus the Court held that Cavanaugh failed to state a claim for relief, so his claim for injunctive relief was dismissed.

His First Amendment claim is dismissed because, as a pro se claimant, he failed to state an alleged injury-- i.e. argue that he was substantially burdened and required to alter his behavior. 

His Equal Protection claim is dismissed essentially because the Court ruled that the officials ""considered Cavanaugh's request in good faith and concluded, reasonably, that FSMism was satirical and required no accommodation.""

His state claims were dismissed because they offered the same protections as their federal counterparts.

The plaintiff was offered no leave to amend his Complaint, and the Order was final. 

EDIT: It is worth noting that the IRS has approved the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster tax exempt status 501(C)3.

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

But they're next, and -- to mix a metaphor -- Clinton's weak showing is the canary in the coal mine."

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "

"3763","1460773896","A moral economy is one that functions on basic economic principles. A basic tenet is the law of diminishing returns meaning your second dollar should be harder to earn than your first and your third harder than your second.

The rich can't help but get richer and they hardly have to work for it."

It grows by ever-expanding debt, on the assumption of limitless growth, that will always be large enough to repay past debts, to keep the whole game credible.  But that's no longer working.  Instead, we get bubbles and busts.  Real wealth has stagnated.  What to do? Assume that global warming is real, and very threatening.  It does not present market signals that promote survival.  What's needed is a global-political re-orientation to direct resources for a sustainable future.  For that future to be worth living in, it must involve people in decision-making, and as much local control as possible.  That's where all this must go, or we can just give up the fight.

""Moral economy"" is a new word wrapping for the old economic system ""socialism."" Putting it in a shiny new clamshell pack of words difficult to pry open may be deceptive marketing, but its promoters hope it will be enough to get buyers to purchase their item again, something that due to the market's bad experience with the product they cannot do if they continue to package it as ""socialism.""

Francis invited Sanders to the stage and microphone of the Vatican immediately prior to a critically important primary because he too is selling the product, and indeed he is the leading marketer behind the new packaging design. The program is being taken up now by others involved in the sales effort.

I doubt it will work. Buyers are not so stupid they will be tricked by a shiny new package on a failed old product, not many of them, not for long. There being no consumer protection agency to regulate false political advertising, though, the marketing can go forward."

"3776","1460732181","I still think his answer is vague and unclear both in the NYT interview and during the debate.  All he said was that one regulator (Sec Treasury) would determine a bar that defines too big then ""the banks can figure it out"".  This makes it sound like there is one simple metric out there that they can use when it is an enormously complicated issue.  It seems perfectly fair to criticize his answers as vague and lacking details because that is exactly what they are.

She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues. 

Keeping all that in mind I would take her opinion on a lot of these topics over a lot of people any day, including most people in this thread."

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.  She doesn't need to go to jail.. they need to revoke her clearance and boot her ass out of any position of responsibility."

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.  




(http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-really-hard-to-get-bernie-sanders-988-more-delegates/) 

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Conn Clinton +6

Maryland Clinton +22

Penn  Clinton +14

CA  Clinton +11

NJ  Clinton +25

"4452","1460701278","Most aren't denying the importance of infrastructure.  Most are debating the methods which should be used to pay for it.  The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

"4467","1460744196","This column encapsulates Reddit, /r/politics, and /r/SandersforPresident in a nutshell:

&gt;What you see, on this as on multiple issues, is the casual adoption, with no visible effort to check the premises, of a story line that sounds good. It’s all about the big banks; single-payer is there for the taking if only we want it; government spending will yield huge payoffs — not the more modest payoffs conventional Keynesian analysis suggests; Republican support will vanish if we take on corporate media.

&gt;In each case the story runs into big trouble if you do a bit of homework; if not completely wrong, it needs a lot of qualification. But the all-purpose response to anyone who raises questions is that she or he is a member of the establishment, personally corrupt, etc.. Ad hominem attacks aren’t a final line of defense, they’re argument #1.

&gt;I know some people think that I’m obsessing over trivial policy details, but they’re missing the point. *It’s about an attitude, the sense that righteousness excuses you from the need for hard thinking and that any questioning of the righteous is treason to the cause.* **When you see Sanders supporters going over the top about “corporate whores” and such, you’re not seeing a mysterious intrusion of bad behavior into an idealistic movement; you’re seeing the intolerance that was always just under the surface of the movement, right from the start.**

I started out as neutral. I'm not American and I like to watch American politics from afar because I don't have to get emotionally invested and I don't have to eventually pick a side. But then the Sanders supporters got just so very toxic.

**Sanders supporters, you need to pay attention to this:** Your movement is toxic. You've taken it and tarnished it and smeared shit all over it. You've treated everyone who wasn't a True Believer in Bernie Sanders like a pariah, or like they're an evil paid corporate shill. You've acted like condescending assholes that nobody wants to associate with.

You will look back on this one day and you will cringe with embarrassment. You will get involved more deeply in politics one day and you will realize that your actions helped strangle Bernie Sanders's presidential bid in its cradle. You will look back at this and realize that you acted completely contrary to how people need to act in politics to win supporters.

It's sad this article is getting downvoted, because you need to read it. You guys need to know one of the reasons Bernie is losing and why he will never win."

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.

He's a bitter old man, who hates that he isn't as well liked as Jordan, hates that he didn't make the money modern athletes did, and continues to be one of the most self righteous and unlikeable athletes alive. He's got plenty of time to call out flaws in other people, but is pretty much an absentee father. Go check out the AMA with Kareem's estranged son. 

There's a reason why no one has given Kareem a head coaching job despite the fact he's wanted one for 15 years, even though he's clearly smart enough. It's not racism. There are plenty of less qualified black coaches. *No one wants to work with Kareem.* He's a douchebag.

I'm sorry this doesn't have anything to do with politics, but I used to like Kareem. I wanted to believe in the idea of this intelligent, politically conscious guy who was about more than basketball. But now I just think he's a smug douchebag, who while pretty smart, is also pretty full of shit."

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues."

The amounts of jobs to produce value (goods and services) will drop drastically in the near future, but not the means of production.

Someone needs to consume that value. Just another reason why income inequality is a serious issue to the economy. If we have loads of poor people not being able to buy anything, what are we gonna do? Just pile laptops and teslas in some warehouse somewhere for no reason at all?

And yes, there will obviously be jobs, and entirely new industries, but most likely people will spend a lot more time studying, researching, coding and creating art when a lot of mindless jobs have been taken over by robots. I see no reason why basic income shouldn't be the security net in that world."

The problem is Bernie doesn't want to fully hang the albatross around Hillary's neck, perhaps in deference to the fact that she is likely to be the nominee and will need progressives' support in the general. 

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

Everyone in the establishment is warning that Bernie had better be careful and not do anything to permanently damage Hillary. But you KNOW if Bernie were leading Hillary would do everything she could to permanently damage Bernie without hesitation, because all she cares about is winning, despite her claims to the contrary. And nobody in the establishment would come to Bernie's defense and say ""hey back off don't destroy our potential nominee."" And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

But I've asked this before and still not received a clear answer; what exactly have Hillary's donors received from her in terms of specific consideration in her platform, that is otherwise inconsistent from a position she might reasonably hold in the absence of their influence?

Americans have called ""shenanigans"" on this in both parties, this election.

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.  

Both conventions this year will be hotly contested.  We'll see delegates switching, terrible accusations being made, etc. But what we'll mainly see is a question of ""Who is the Party?  Is it the people who register and vote for that Party?  Or is it the few wealthy elites behind the scenes that are the Party?""

"5033","1460652034","I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt; We can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man of no capital.

"5309","1460630066","My takeaway from the primaries -

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

One thing I do like about the primaries is that in most cases it is not winner take all. I would actually like to see the general election adopt a similar rule where state's electoral votes are awarded proportionally to the popular vote of that state."

It went something like (very heavily paraphrased) ""people that believe in X always accuse people that don't of being corrupt, what a bunch of deluded losers"" totally unnecessary disparaging uncharacteristic of anyone trying to write an objective, intelligent opinion piece.

Followed by ""I don't believe in X"".

"5417","1460651938","Krugman is correct, though. See the FCIC testimonies of [Gary Gorton](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15787) and [Ben Bernanke](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm) as a starting point.

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

"5423","1460660389","Why won't she support Bernie if she actually cares so much???"
"5424","1460646328","&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

This doesn't exist for various reasons. Journalists are people too and they have their own prejudices. Even when reporting facts, they can change the way their reporting will be perceived either by omission or commission (associating something to something else which may not necessarily relevant). So, the media is effectively divided into two kinds: those who lie blatantly, and those who do it with a lot of sophistication.

Otherwise, you could go with what Crichton referred to as [the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect](http://web.archive.org/web/20080312214444/http://www.michaelcrichton.com/speech-whyspeculate.html):

&gt; Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I call it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)

&gt; Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

&gt; In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

&gt; The saga continues.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

The geographical makeup of the country also gives an unfair advantage to populated areas.

**Just scare tactics here. The company is simply trying to strong-arm the local government.**   

The current minimum wage is $10.00  and it will slowly rise to $15 over the next 6 years.   If American Apparel was really worried about labor cost they could have built their garment factory in say Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina or Tennessee all of which do not have a state minimum wage and thus starting pay is $7.25 an hour.  For some reason however they find LA a desirable location for their factory so I call bullshit.    Also by the time we get to 2022 the federal minimum wage will likely be close to $15 an hour anyway making the relocation argument a waste of time. "
"5692","1460823906","This is where I call bullshit that the minimum wage hike is the reason companies like American Apparel are cutting jobs or claiming they can't afford to stay.

1)""I used to pay $5 to get this sewn, and now it costs $6.50,"" Seo said, holding up a patterned dress. ""But my customer doesn't want to pay that, so I can't sell it anymore.""

People have no problem paying $1.50 more. Especially when their wages just went from 8 dollars an hour to gradually increasing to 15 an hour. The problem is companies like this see an opportunity to ship it overseas and pay $2 to get it sewn and can keep their prices the same. Maximizing their profit margin.(this is a problem with trade deals) And then blame the minimum wage for them leaving.

&gt;""it can be difficult to find skilled workers who can afford to live in the city.""

And then this bit. It is difficult because these skilled workers aren't going to work at a wage that doesn't cover living expenses. This problem is created by companies like American Apparel who refuse to pay their employees a wage that is reasonable.

Also, what they don't tell you is American Apparel has spent millions on lawsuits. They are poorly managed and have had plenty of issues and have made shitty decisions when it has came to the business. Now they have a scape goat. So they blame cutting jobs on other factors instead they just have completely sucked at managing the business. But it looks better blaming others.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;&gt;    a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

&gt;Really, we should do both. Politically, we'll do neither.

Is there a Sanders backer who doesn't yell at the TV at every one of these debates - ""Why didn't you say...?"" The answer, I believe, is that Sanders simply is not 'quick on his feet' whereas Clinton is adept at the bob and weave.

Clinton continues to refuse to take responsibility for any mistakes, refuses to release her transcripts, waffled hard on minimum wage, and sounded like she was ready to physically attack Sanders and Blitzer at times. Sanders went on the offensive the whole debate and it simply doesn't look good on him. Sanders on the attack makes him look too angry, it makes him stumble over words, and he makes mistakes (in one instance he claimed Clinton hadn't answered the question and ironically it was one of the few questions she answered up front, though she rambled for the rest of her time to burn the clock).

I don't think this debate is going to change polls much (if at all) because while this was probably Clinton's worst debate performance of the campaign so far, it was also, arguably, Sanders's worst.

All this being said, this is the one debate that CNN held which actually challenged Clinton. They held her feet over the fire on her transcripts as well as her Vermont comments."

You do realize that by insulting these people, encouraging Hilary to insult these people. You risk her losing their vote if she wins the primaries. 

Anyways, words like : Commie, Socialist, Atheist, etc..aren't really insults in the eyes of people under 30. We didn't live through the cold war. I see my father call him a socialist and then be like that's that. But you gotta see that people who weren't alive or of age during the cold war don't have that stigmatization about Socialism or Communism. That's not gonna be enough to deter Bernie's supporters."

Sanders isn't going to win a majority of pledged delegates, but Clinton's pledged delegate total won't be an absolute majority either.  So technically the nomination cannot be decided until the superdelegates cast their ballots in July, so all his supporters should keep fighting.

Obviously what actually happens is that the instant the polls close in DC on the final primary (and realistically somewhat before) the horse trading phase of the nomination starts.

I did an analysis of what the delegates totals would be if the South voted today, and if Bernie lost the black vote by 40 points (30-70) Clinton's lead would be about ~115 less, or around 100.  This is assuming he still does a little worse than he has in statess like Missouri, but I think the 30% is a reasonable mark.

They MUST decrypt the data if the government so requires. Obviously, it is not possible if the encryption occurs **client side** and the key is in the hands of the user.

* almost all encryption experts think it is a bad idea, and makes it impossible to secure personal, medical, and financial data.

* terrorists and criminals will always have their own encryption, like PGP.   Or use foreign services.  This will affect only ordinary citizens.

* This bill will hurt US industry, and force anybody who incorporates security to move offshore. 

* This bill is extremely invasive: Taken at face value, even the web browser you and I are using may become illegal to distribute, because its authors (covered entities under Section 4(4)) can't decrypt messages it sends [Section 3(a)(2)],  including this message.

How is this different than your landlord being forced to open your apartment if you are suspected of committing a crime?  Or a cop breaking down your door because he has a warrant?  Or your bank being forced to disclose transactions that may be related to criminal activity?

I'm all for privacy, but if you commit a crime don't you forfeit that right to some extent?  Shouldn't we, as a society, have some mechanism for catching criminals and enforcing laws?  Why should we make it easier for the outlaws and scumbags of our society to hide their activity?

I understand the client-side encryption angle, but it seems that at the end of the day providers wouldn't be held liable for users implementing features not offered by their service.  It would be like the government suing the telephone company because I used their phone line to deal drugs.  They can ask for and subpoena call logs, but can't sue the phone company for my behavior.

California did this in the 70s and it led to the so-called ""tax revolt era"" where citizens overwhelmingly voted in favor of restrictions on the ability of the state to raise tax revenue from property and business taxes. Result: CA nearly went bankrupt in the 80s and 90s because they couldn't raise taxes to generate new revenue.

To go out of the country for almost two days just a few days before the NY primary is dumbfounding, especially when Bernie has shown multiple times that the more time he spends campaigning in a state before the voters vote, the better he ends up doing. Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do. As a Bernie supporter, I'd prefer he'd skip the speech, and spend the time campaigning in NY instead."

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there.

This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

"6633","1460660064","&gt; Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job. Let's not make ovaries a requirement of high office--just like we wouldn't make religion or race or whatever. "

"6663","1460679229","Jackson was a ~~badass~~ fucking insane person:

&gt;The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she
With silent lips. ""Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"""

Many Verizon employees are being placed on emergency work assignment to fill the position of these union members. My mom has had this lingering assignment weighing over her head since these strike talks began. She also had to participate in this same issue in 2011 when the first phase of strikes began. It is not just the union workers that are being mistreated by this corporation, but the other employees that work hard day-to-day without going on strike to ask for increased wages/benefits. There is more to this story than what is being covered in the news. "
"7046","1460582922","These companies hold private court with our elected officials and then pretend not to see that as an advantage over their employees. I know the only reason I ever contact or send contributions to politicians is either hoping their vote will influence a law or to thank them for great representation.

 A lot of people aren't even making enough to save and yet people will call them greedy for wanting decent wages and working conditions. And a lot of the avenues that we once had to represent that have been eroded away over the years by folks like the heads of Verizon. It's not just Clinton turning a blind eye to or gladhanding this situation, but as far as I know, it ain't Sanders. He seems to be the only person that gets the part I'm worried about."

Well the Owner of Politi-Fact endorsed Clinton a while back so this kind of deception is not surprising."
"7057","1460677849","so the research shows, ""we'll never know"" because the data shows she paid them less, but it's unknown what positions either side held, so we'll never know who's right - not ""mostly false"" imo

IE we asked HRC's campaign, and while the only real data we have supports the claim, were going to take their word for it and rate this mostly False.

Also will Sanders Wall Street tax pay for free public college? Well it includes partial state funding (that already exists in part or total), and a conservative estimate only shows it would raise 80-100% of the money needed, and some govenors might reject it (which would result in students by and large leaving the state for free college in less shitty places) so we'll also rate his claim mostly false.

Internet Freedom
Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning."

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it. And capital should be taxed the most. Spend it or lose it, once again encouraging consumption."

"7123","1460647105","As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

* Massachusetts has ~1/3 of New York's population, but has open primaries. This shows either the huge opportunity for either candidate to drive voter turnout on Tuesday, or just how much closed primaries affect turnout, or both.

It's pretty well documented that she made a vast number of mistakes.

""Yes, everyone can have their own opinion. That's fine....Bernie can't win. Stop taking shit about Hillary"" 
Contradiction duly noted, great logic. 

""A vote for Bernie is a vote for Trump which is a vote for Hitler.""
Wait what? A vote for Bernie is a vote for Bernie, while a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. Trump's attitudes and ideas might resemble Hitler's but you literally can't vote for Hitler seeing as how he's been dead for 71 years. Bernie and Hitler couldn't be farther from each other. If anything, the democratic nominee closest to old Adolf is Hillary Rodham Hitler...I mean Clinton..my bad. 

""Just be American and get behind Hillary. (It's not corruption, bromeisters, it's pragmatism.)"" I'm sure Adolfo and Mussolini gave some similar logic trying to convince Germans/Italians to join the fascist cause. ""Be German/Italian and get behind Hitler/Mussolini, its not corruption. Its insanity...I mean pragmatism""

A speaker at a Bernie Sanders rally uses the term ""corporate Democratic whores,"" which obviously looks bad because the other candidate is Hillary. Bernie denounces the use of that language.

Hillary Clinton reads a script that includes her direct involvement in the ""CP time"" joke, and decides that is a good idea. After being called out on it she does not apologize, and also shifts the blame to de Blasio.

Not that exact poll, of course, but years ago when he got elected people were shouting about how it will be a new day for race relations and how he would inspire young blacks and so on.

That hasn't happened, and Trump is pointing that out to remind people that race isn't everything, in fact, it apparently had no effect on this situation or even worsened it (google for recent articles on ""obama race relations""), despite *other people* (not Trump) saying for the past 8 years that a black president would make a difference in black communities (but that's not racist?)

I see no reason to believe Trump isn't simply using the word ""thug"" as the word ""thug,"" not as a veiled racial slur. Here's the definition (first one on google):

&gt; a violent person, especially a criminal.

So: other people made racist comments for years, Trump calls them out on it, then calls violent people ""thugs"" (which is what the word means), and *Trump* gets branded a racist.

Don't be obtuse. Blacks made him the spokesperson in charge for all black controversy and issues. See William Gates and every other minuscule incident involving blacks.

When there is a huge riot centered around a movement called white lives matter then I'm sure the white president will be asked to give his thoughts on the matter. Till then...

&gt;Does anyone think the race of the president is somehow relevant since it is the same as the race of the rioters?

Mostly it's not. When the story is big enough then yeah, the president is asked to weigh in. See Kanye.

&gt;Trump mean more than the dictionary definition when he says ""Thugs?"" ""Thugs"" has an original non racial definition and then a much more popular common usage as a slur for black people.

Again, you are being obtuse. As you well know, until recently the term thug was always defined simply as a violent criminal of any race.

"7501","1460737844","The points raised in the article are all likely true, but that does not mean that the issue should be dismissed out-of-hand.

If part of the effect is due to ""Women also tend to leave the workforce for periods to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay, and choose careers that tend to have lower pay."", then we need to look at a way to address this. 

When my child was born, I asked my boss if I could work part-time for six months to help my wife out. I wanted to work a ""90%"" schedule where I could take off every other Friday to give my wife a break (I had used up my vacation for parental leave). He looked at me like I had two heads and told me that the logistics of that were too hard to work out (the company is mid-sized, with over 500 employees). He would not let me do this even though I assured him that I could still do 100% of my duties in 90% of the time.

A number of women had part-time schedules in the company, but they were almost universally looked down upon. So there was not only a different standard in allowing part-time work (women could grudgingly get this, men could not), but there was a different opinion given when this was used.

Of course, the ""corporate"" message is ""yes, you should definitely be penalized, career-wise, if you choose to work less"". That is the assumption that needs to be challenged, because we are all humans, we have parents, we have children, and we wouldn't have much of a society if we make child-rearing a taboo corporate activity."

I feel like the whole concept of a career is completely changing and my generation won't ever see the kind of working environment that generations before us have. Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily. And it makes more sense to me that the 'benefits' be paid for with our taxes rather than out of pocket. Obviously the cost of it is daunting, but I think it will only makes sense moving forward.

"7616","1460615853","Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

But ignoring that, I really found this article impactful. Everything I read about Hillary doing her job in government just impresses me. And yeah, she's a truly awful campaigner, but I can't say I care very much.

The one thing that really struck me in here is the line about how when she was campaigning in 2008, she'd go out for speeches and people would hold up signs saying ""Beat the Bitch"". I mean...what the fuck. Was I unaware of this in 2008? Did I just not care? That's like a movie scene - having her go onstage, ready to campaign and be excited about reaching out to people, only to see something like that. It must have been a punch in the gut. Just awful."

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"

"7784","1460588235","The scarier thing about all of this (I mean, really who gives a fuck if yet another latin american banana republic has a forced change of leadership?) is hillary's fluency in revisionist policy.

"7786","1460625392","So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

&gt; Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, “so messed up”.

Mainly the utility poles, trenches and limited usable frequencies that all traverse public space to connect us all together.  It is very similar to our interstates and roadways.  Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

Insurers won't even think about writing coverage on nuclear power plants, so any issues that arise will make the company insolvent or put the onus on cleaning up or repairing any damage on the taxpayers. I know that nuclear power is generally considered safe, but accidents can and do happen, and by increasing the exposure to that risk we greatly increase our chances of a catastrophic event.

The U.S. Constitution says nothing about political parties, which are private enterprises able to set their own rules. It takes a blatant example like the recent Republican caucus in Colorado — where voters were entirely cut out of the process and Cruz was awarded all the state's delegates — to make that abundantly clear.

&gt;I think the big takeaway in this election cycle is how little the popular vote matters because of Citizens United.

Continuing:

&gt;Are we really a democratic republic, or are we an oligarchy because of Citizens United ? The U.S. Constitution says nothing about political parties, which are private enterprises able to set their own rules because of Citizens United. 

&gt;Voters may feel disenfranchised, disgusted and downright angry because of Citizens United.

Revolutions happen in history books and in other parts of the world, not in modern-day America because of Citizens United.
