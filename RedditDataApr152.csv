"113","1460712225","They should have never let off of this, and I'm glad it came up at the debate.

She has had months to address this. No Democratic candidate should be able to deflect with ""I'll do it when the Republicans do it."" 

They're not the ones saying they support campaign finance reform, you are Hillary."
"114","1460715858","In regards to her speaking fees it would be nice for her supporters to at least admit there is a potential conflict of interest instead of acting like money influencing politics is an alien concept when it's come to the democrats."
"115","1460716358","Just watch her avoid it on last nights debate. Even if I supported her, I would feel dirty watching that display. It there is not a pile of incriminating statements in that speech she is absolutely insane for acting like this. You need a big imagination to find any gray area. "
"116","1460713722","The pressure will fade away, unless Bernie Sanders directly mentions it again, instead of through twitter or something"
"117","1460724290","Hillary's campaign was the first to make an issue of demanding president Obama's birth certificate. That bogus issue has dogged Obama for 8 years since.  Now she is making a fake issue of Senator Sander's taxes. She is very good at assassination by innuendo."
"118","1460727513"," What has she said in these speeches that scares her from releasing it.  I personally think she has criticised what ever little Obama has done about the banks as well as promised she will reverse it when she becomes president. That would destroy her candidacy as she has portrayed herself as someone that would take Obama's policies forward. And she has been on record saying that she wasn't planning to run for presidency when she gave those speeches."
"119","1460720807","Ultimately I believe she needs to feel the pressure from the voters before she'll ever do this.  She doesn't give two shits about this press coverage, or hash tags, or websites unless she starts to truly lose and those losses can be linked it this. Yes he won recently but NY will likely go her way bc of the bullshit closed primary and party affiliation change deadline. I keep reading that she's pressured and she seemed pissed last night at times but a NY win will chill her out quick. I hope I wrong about NY but I got too emotional after IL and FL to not be cautious. 

Further, it would have to be true desperation bc it seems like there's some BAD shit in there since they haven't been released yet. 

I'd put the liklihood that we ever see these at the same odds as my 7 year old declaring she's over Mac and Cheese. Basically zero. "
"120","1460722558","I kind of like Hillary - but why the Democratic Party allowed her to run and then backed her so strongly is beyond me. I would really like to see a women president but gender is secondary to merits. So much smoke ..."
"121","1460728258","*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton’s decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "
"122","1460720511","There are lots of things the Republicans haven't done yet, like embrace same sex marriage. 

If Clinton wanted to use Republicans as a reason not to get into something or do something, she could still hold her true beliefs that gays should not marry and just play it off like Republicans haven't done it yet. "

"129","1460729238","Her whole ""Reasoning"" for not makes me nauseous. Your not running against the republican yet Hillary, stop pretending they have anything to do with the democratic fucking primary. You want to use that bullshit in the general then fine, then it might make some sense. "

You compromise and wheedle and make get indebted to folks and they give you money and you that's how you get elected. Bernie is a crazy, weird unicorn. A Socialist independent. From Vermont.

But I also think it's right of Hillary to say that her puppet strings aren't any different than the Republican candidates -- and in fact, probably less noxious, but she doesn't want to put hers on display, because the Republican super-pacs will run with that in the general, and she doesn't need any more Negatives.

At first I thought it was probable that she'd said something innocuous-seeming but unethical. My working theory was that she'd told these groups of people that she was definitely running for president, which would have made the speaking fees FEC violations. But I decided last night, while she dodged this question multiple times, that maybe it's something else. 

Maybe those transcripts were stored on her private server along with the rest of the Clinton Foundation's documents. Maybe she can't release then because they're currently part of the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which is just one of the investigations currently underway. And if they are, then she can't really say ""Well I'd be happy to give them to you as soon as the FBI lets me.""

She cannot release the transcripts because it will sink her campaign over night and she and her advisors know this.  Bernie should've accused her relentlessly of saying one thing behind closed doors and another to the public, he should've made her so uncomfortable she had no choice but to relent and release the speeches--they would be the death knell of her campaign, when people realize how cozy she is with the big banks they are going to flee her in droves.

We are still dealing with Republicans deciding not to work with Democrats because they lost the election.  I really do not feel energized to see a candidate who only became a Democrat, so he could get the democrat money to run for President and who will not only be unable to work with Republicans but also unwilling to work with many democrats.   

I also do not see a problem with the word establishment and will be more than happy when this election is over and the word is retired.   Sanders has been in government for a long time and the only reason he is not ""establishment"" is because he refuses to work with people and get things done.

I also could not believe that on the topic of the Supreme Court nominations that Clinton brough up Roe v. Wade and what it is to be a woman and how women need rights.

She CREATED a conflict of interest. It was her decision. No one else made it for her. Politicians (universally) need to be transparent and disclose all potential conflicts of interest and this undoubtedly qualifies."

"182","1460696103","Heres the thing about Hillary. She isnt much worse than any other politician out there. *Everyone* is corrupt. And compared to a lot of the corrupt politicians, Hillary isnt too bad. Thats why she thinks she's justified in not releasing the transcripts. Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change. 

If I could give Hillary one piece of advice, it would be this: Forget about yourself, remember America."

Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-05-20/news/9102270272_1_nra-officials-brady-bill-powerful-gun).)

He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

"330","1460715245","I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."

"333","1460709046","Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"

&gt;The wage would increase more gradually upstate, hitting **$12.50 in six years.**

Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country. Our founders wanted the soldier's, and the king's taxes, out. It was not about establishing a Christian nation. They drank, they whored, they swore. They were men. Normal men.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus?

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

"534","1460724998","The reason Bernie is winning, is because he cares. He doesn't act like a politician, he acts like a human. Great movements in America have always required being human before being a politician. Hillary is getting huge sums of money for being a Clinton.  She says she represents the people,  but she isn't talking about her ideas. She criticizes Bernie's ideas, and tries to find loopholes. When I watch her, it almost seems like she is arguing in court trying to use long articulated sentences while replying to simple questions.   She acts like what's done is done, and that these changes Bernie speaks of shouldn't be attempted.  In the 1700s, England was in its prime, and mighty.  The colonists were at their mercy, yet they stood up, and fought for what they believed in despite the situation being ""imlossible."" When Lincoln dropped the emancipation proclamation on the world, much of the United States didn't support this, he was even assassinated.  Here we are now.  To us common plebs it just appears as though Clinton is running for office because she wants to add that to her biography.   Sanders wants to/acts like he wants to make a difference. "

She's a poor rhetorician in a number of ways: her voice is shrill; her rhythm is flat; and her expression swings from serious to bemused to annoyed to offended. She also tends to dissemble. A lot. You see it when she begins a sentence with, ""I've always"" or ""my entire life"" or ""I've never"". It's simply not possible for a person to have always held a simple position on a complex issue such as the second amendment, social security, abortion. There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur.""

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."

&gt;Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, an Argentine and one of Francis’ key advisers at the Vatican, said he was aware of but disputed the perception that the pope disliked the United States. Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said. Francis recently helped negotiate a historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations that has led to restored diplomatic ties between the countries."

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "
"647","1460681953","Maybe because everyone is sick and tired of endless election year protests manufactured to grab headlines in promotion of one progressive cause after another, and the reporters know it? Just a thought."
"648","1460713934","...Um.

&gt; What I said was, Jeff, to clear the record and I think you'll agree on this, the danger of taking money from any interest is that you're not so aggressive in going after them, let's face it that's the real problem and I think we can agree on that.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.

But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

It is Democrats who refuse to simplify the tax code while bitching and moaning that corporations pay no taxes... they need the wedge issue to whip the rank and file left in an outraged lather...

Besides, that there is the $1 trillion which was supposed to go for infrastructure but instead went where? - shored up public pensions.

"1076","1460701278","Most aren't denying the importance of infrastructure.  Most are debating the methods which should be used to pay for it.  The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

"1089","1460711369","Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

"1129","1460711369","Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

"1221","1460694136","National polls don't mean a lot right now, I think.  I believe it is the pollong on the coming primary states that really matter.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released.

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.

"1496","1460652034","I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;After all that, Black came to the conclusion that “capitalism works better if we don’t have a class of banks who take all the reward and none of the risk.” And like Ryan, he thinks the fallout of that disparity is written all over New York city.

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.

One of these executive orders, Action #14, noted that “in addition to being a law enforcement challenge, gun violence is also a serious public health issue that affects thousands of individuals, families, and communities across the Nation” (White House, 2013b). This order directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other relevant federal agencies, to immediately begin identifying the most pressing research problems in firearm-related violence with the greatest potential for broad public health impact...""

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

"1766","1460646328","&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

They MUST decrypt the data if the government so requires. Obviously, it is not possible if the encryption occurs **client side** and the key is in the hands of the user.

* almost all encryption experts think it is a bad idea, and makes it impossible to secure personal, medical, and financial data.

* terrorists and criminals will always have their own encryption, like PGP.   Or use foreign services.  This will affect only ordinary citizens.

* This bill will hurt US industry, and force anybody who incorporates security to move offshore. 

* This bill is extremely invasive: Taken at face value, even the web browser you and I are using may become illegal to distribute, because its authors (covered entities under Section 4(4)) can't decrypt messages it sends [Section 3(a)(2)],  including this message.   This bill requires the authors of a web browser (which can be thousands of un-validated people for open source software) to be able to break into all of your most private personal, banking, and medical communications.

How is this different than your landlord being forced to open your apartment if you are suspected of committing a crime?  Or a cop breaking down your door because he has a warrant?  Or your bank being forced to disclose transactions that may be related to criminal activity?

I'm all for privacy, but if you commit a crime don't you forfeit that right to some extent?  Shouldn't we, as a society, have some mechanism for catching criminals and enforcing laws?  Why should we make it easier for the outlaws and scumbags of our society to hide their activity?

I understand the client-side encryption angle, but it seems that at the end of the day providers wouldn't be held liable for users implementing features not offered by their service.  It would be like the government suing the telephone company because I used their phone line to deal drugs.  They can ask for and subpoena call logs, but can't sue the phone company for my behavior.

California did this in the 70s and it led to the so-called ""tax revolt era"" where citizens overwhelmingly voted in favor of restrictions on the ability of the state to raise tax revenue from property and business taxes. Result: CA nearly went bankrupt in the 80s and 90s because they couldn't raise taxes to generate new revenue. 

So, while direct democracy sounds great, you have to realize that MOST citizens don't actually know how to run a state/country. This is PRECISELY why our founding fathers set up the U.S. as a republic, not a democracy. "

To go out of the country for almost two days just a few days before the NY primary is dumbfounding, especially when Bernie has shown multiple times that the more time he spends campaigning in a state before the voters vote, the better he ends up doing. Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do. As a Bernie supporter, I'd prefer he'd skip the speech, and spend the time campaigning in NY instead."

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

"2501","1460660064","&gt; Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job. Let's not make ovaries a requirement of high office--just like we wouldn't make religion or race or whatever. "

&gt;The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

For years, it has been hard for the legal system to tackle it, since you need an aggrieved party in order to have a case. (The idea being that the supreme court - or any court - cannot make a ruling on hypothetical incidents.  They need physical plaintiffs, physical defendants, and explicit harm.)

Up to this point, the defendants were known (corrupt scientists, professors, and think tanks), the harm has been known (yes, global warming **is** real, along with gravity, and - gasp - evolution), but the plaintiffs have not been known.  This ruling helps to fill that gap."

Many Verizon employees are being placed on emergency work assignment to fill the position of these union members. My mom has had this lingering assignment weighing over her head since these strike talks began. She also had to participate in this same issue in 2011 when the first phase of strikes began. It is not just the union workers that are being mistreated by this corporation, but the other employees that work hard day-to-day without going on strike to ask for increased wages/benefits.

http://www.exposethetpp.org/TPPImpacts_InternetFreedom.html

&gt;The Trans-Pacific Partnership Would Undermine 
Internet Freedom
Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning."

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it.

"2950","1460647105","As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

* Democratic turnout was over 1.86 million voters. (Republican turnout was just under 643,000)
* For further reference that is about 1.5x the voter turnout for Dems in Massachusetts in both 2008 and this year and only slightly more than Rep. voter turnout in Mass this year
* Massachusetts has ~1/3 of New York's population, but has open primaries. This shows either the huge opportunity for either candidate to drive voter turnout on Tuesday, or just how much closed primaries affect turnout, or both.

Hillary Clinton reads a script that includes her direct involvement in the ""CP time"" joke, and decides that is a good idea. After being called out on it she does not apologize, and also shifts the blame to de Blasio.

Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily. And it makes more sense to me that the 'benefits' be paid for with our taxes rather than out of pocket. Obviously the cost of it is daunting, but I think it will only makes sense moving forward.

"3226","1460615853","Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

"3254","1460625630","almost certainly a meaningless stat, but it's true that per person in VT this small number of 55 is bigger than the others

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"

"3393","1460592937","I was one of Dana Frank's graduate students.

I am really excited to see her being critical of Hillary's actions here; if anybody knows anything about the US government's role in Honduras, it is Professor Frank."
"3394","1460588235","The scarier thing about all of this (I mean, really who gives a fuck if yet another latin american banana republic has a forced change of leadership?) is hillary's fluency in revisionist policy.

Beyond that two other things strike me as making her particularly unelectable:

1 - either she knew about US involvement in the coup and was willing to parrot back party line

or 

2 - she was oblivious and just willing to violate US law"

"3396","1460625392","So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

&gt; Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, “so messed up”.

Mainly the utility poles, trenches and limited usable frequencies that all traverse public space to connect us all together.  It is very similar to our interstates and roadways.  Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative.

""A number of Clinton emails show how, starting shortly after the coup, HRC and her team shifted the deliberations on Honduras from the Organization of American States (OAS) – where Zelaya could benefit from the strong support of left-wing allies throughout the region – to the San José negotiation process in Costa Rica. There, representatives of the coup regime were placed on an equal footing with representatives of Zelaya’s constitutional government, and Costa Rican president Oscar Arias (a close U.S. ally) as mediator.  Unsurprisingly, the negotiation process only succeeded in one thing: keeping Zelaya out of office for the rest of his constitutional mandate.  "" http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/09/24/hillary-clinton-emails-and-honduras-coup"

Honestly, this country is lucky that it's as stable as it is now, because with the way most of us feel, we all could literally say, ""fuck work, fuck bills, let's save my humanity"", all join together, and just fucking *go* downtown, or to our respective state capitals, and just *protest*.

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.  

This is all theoretical of course, but its one scenario keep imaging with this situation."

http://boston.indymedia.org/newswire/index.php

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!"

Violence against the police only makes people STOP liking you.  You can get your message heard these days, thanks to mass media and social media, so easily.  But, there is also the side-effect that all the douchey stuff you do becomes noticeable too, on both sides, right away.

Seriously, if any of you are planning on protesting, do it peacefully.  Don't turn into one of those mentally challenged protesters, ""But you're a white male!"" as you scream in someone's face that they can't possibly relate because of that.  As soon as you start blocking ambulances and throwing stuff at police, I instantly think you are a scummy person of low intellectual capacity.

Seriously, think about it for a second, what does blocking an ambulance on the street actually do.  What is the purpose of your protest.  Do you think people are going to become enlightened to your message and flock to you and be inspired by you by doing that?  Now, I assume most of you reading this are reasonably intelligent people to agree with this idea that ya, that is dumb.  But you see, that is why I think I am completely justified in questioning the intellectual capacity of morons that do things like that because they lack so much self-awareness as to not realize the stupidity of it all.  It can't just be mob-mentality.  It can't just be brainwashing.  Brainwashing happens, but a smart person will at least approach and follow the cause in some meaningful and intelligent way...

TL;DR - Protests are fine, just don't be stupid.  It doesn't help your cause, it only hurts it. DON'T BE STUPID!"

This is the problem with WaPo and other MSM outlets today. It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd. It's the constant defeatism and uninspiring approval of the truly meager progress being made that shifts focus away from the biggest problems in today's political landscape, which *are* structural and pervasive, not specific and discrete. How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

The rise of both Sanders *and* Trump is showing us that people are *not* happy with status quo politics or politicians.

I would pay her a large sum of money for doing something for me. Maybe giving a short presentation or a speech.

Way way way way way way fucking WAY more people, and growing all the time, and increasingly scarce resources.

For example: Sanders ""you don't know what it's like to be poor"" statement was rated ""false"" by politifact by the logic that white people can be poor, therefore Sanders is wrong, QED. However, it completely cut out the context: That white people *on average* don't know what it's like to simultaneously be hit with poverty *and* systemic racism, and that poor black people *on average* have it worse than poor white people because of the multiplicative nature of those two things.

&gt;LeBretton said a representative for the Obama administration then asked New Balance to accept a compromise version of the trade deal, **partly** in exchange for a pledge of help getting the Department the Defense to expedite the purchase of US-made shoes.

""Partly""? This allegation needs to be a lot more specific to be taken at all seriously. Who exactly is he claiming promised something and who did they promise it to? Does ""partly"" mean the linkage between the trade deal and the military bidding process was inferred? As he also mentions a ""compromise version of the trade deal"" being discussed was this a USTR rep running some potential trade deal changes by someone from the company who was serving on one of the advisory committees?

&gt; That $1.8 billion in relief from Goldman that's supposed to help homeowners in distress? Miller says that in these cases, the terms are kept vague, and Goldman can use that money to do things that are in its best interest anyway, like writing off debt that's obviously not going to be repaid, demolish foreclosed upon houses, and modify mortgages that are in distress.

&gt;""It would be like me agreeing to be right handed all day today or to wake up tomorrow morning and have coffee,"" Miller says of the settlement agreements. ""Those things are going to happen anyway.""

&gt;He also pointed to something critics have called the ""bullshit-to-cash ratio"" as one indicator of how little the penalty will affect a giant like Goldman. Basically, it's important to note that only about $3 billion of the $5 billion will be paid out in cash. On the other hand, about half is tax-deductible and will be placed on the backs of taxpayers––even though the median American family lost about 40 percent of their wealth during the worst stretch of the crisis.

&gt;What's more, the New York Times notes that after incentives and tax credits, Goldman can chop about a billion dollars off the total penalty. According to a chart attached to the settlement, for every dollar Goldman puts into community investment in New York, they get a $2 tax credit."

"4986","1460564042","One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

If anything, he ran to the *right* of Hillary on some issues, such as his rejection of the individual mandate.

For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

"5115","1460510197","I have been stalking this election as an outside observer to the US and it really is fascinating to me.

I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

I am reminded of Sarah Palin's famous quote; ""*FRUIT FLIES!*"""
"5234","1460675176","Here is the abstract:

&gt;This interdisciplinary research project will advance basic understanding of how tax compliance behavior emerges by focusing on how perceptions of risk and tax fairness form, how these perceptions spread through a social network, and the interplay caused by the complex feedback loops among individual behaviors and population-level outcomes. The project also will address how audit, penalty, and taxation policies, and changes in those policies, influence perceptions and ultimately reduce tax evasion. The project will provide new insights regarding how tax compliance behavior is modified by the perceived aggregated compliance and on how behavior and the perceived aggregated compliance depend on social network structure over which perceptions of taxation spreads. The project will demonstrate the utility of the use of agent-based modeling for research on interactions between individuals and governments as well as how data from the American Life Panel collected by Rand Corporation can be employed to address problems like this. The analysis also will have practical utility, because it will shed light on why certain countries with high taxation levels, such as Scandinavian nations, can maintain high levels of tax compliance while other countries with lower taxation levels may have high levels of tax evasion as is the case in Greece and Italy. Project findings therefore should help nations like the United States reduce the occurrence of tax evasion.

&gt;Income tax evasion is a problem that poses considerable challenges for tax authorities and governments at the local, state, and federal levels. Its causes and implications are both economic and social. The role of tax evasion-related perceptions and how social networks influence those perceptions remain poorly understood, however. The investigators will build an agent-based computational simulation model of income tax evasion. Within the simulation, the compliance behavior of individuals will change through an adaptation process based on their past experiences with audits and tax evasion penalties, their perception of the fairness in taxation rates, and social interactions with people in their social networks. In conjunction, the investigators will conduct a national survey on the perceptions of tax fairness. The survey will gather individual-level data that will inform the simulation model's behavioral mechanisms. These mechanisms influence the propensity to evade, and the survey provides an empirical basis for choosing model-specific parameter values. Model assumptions will further be informed using sensitivity analyses. The simulation model will be validated and calibrated to reproduce U.S. national levels of income tax compliance for different tax brackets. In addition to the U.S., the model also will be calibrated using data sets and compliance levels for Greece and Denmark. Once calibrated, the model will be used to understand how tax evasion behaviors evolve differently depending on various starting assumptions, such as how social networks are structured or what fiscal policies are in place and the conditions for the system to produce tipping point dynamics. The model then will be used to identify fiscal policies that are most effective in minimize tax evasion and recovering compliance. The investigators will employ robust decision making, a method for improving policy decision making, to rank policies based both on their potential performance, as well as how robust this performance is to the key sources of uncertainty. This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.

Not only did it screw my credit, I only found out about it cause when I tried to get my first cell phone (this was in 2001 so cells were just finally going mainstream), Sprint wouldn't let me hey one cause they said I owed them $450 about in long distance phone calls to Mexico.

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me. I remember how embarrassed I was when I got turned down from a job after being interviewed and hired and then my background check came back and they said my credit was worrisome so they didn't hire me, saying they would be happy to talk to me again when I resolved it all.

How is it that BLM protesters can protest at a Medicare event in Seattle, Bernie steps aside and hands the protesters the mic, but both Bernie and ""Bernie supporters"" (again, it wasn't even a Bernie rally, it was a Medicare event for seniors) end up having a ""Black problem"" as a result, with pundits going up and down about what happened at that event 24/7, and it launches into a narrative about Bernie's ""Black problem"" for months, while Hillary can condescend to a BLM protester, have her actually *thrown out* (at a event the girl paid $500 to enter), have her supporters at the event actually ***hiss*** at her, and then Hillary says ""Back to the issues, the issues that are important"" after she's thrown out (as if what that girl was there protesting wasn't an ""important issue"") but the media and pundits end up paying this little mind and it becomes a complete non-issue after a couple days?

"5750","1460556375","&gt;So why hasn't return-free filing happened yet? The short answer is lobbying, and in particular lobbying by companies like Intuit. In 2013, ProPublica's Liz Day wrote an incredible exposé on just how hard Intuit has lobbied to stop return-free filing from becoming a reality:

&gt;&gt;[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

&gt;&gt;Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

This is the problem.  [Campaign finance is the meta issue; it encompasses all others because every legislative battle today, comes down to money.](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/hillary-clintons-plan-to-reform-campaign-finance-i.html)"
"5751","1460553305","&gt;The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it's been doing for years.

&gt;Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.

&gt;Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new ""return-free"" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like. Warren isn't the first person to propose this. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) both have similar bills this Congress.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

Make filing an amendment in this case cost a little money to discourage procrastination in those who do have changes to make.

The whole ""it wasn't marked classified!"" is just a lawyers obfuscation to confuse people on what she did.  

   As an example if I am briefed on a top secret drone program in Yemen.  Then I go and write an email that describes that program in detail on an unsecured system. The information wasn't marked classified but I still committed in a felony.  Another great example is Edward Snowden. By the Hillary definition of a crime all he had to do was retype all the documents he stole without the classification markings and they are unclassified. It's that easy!"

When trusts were broken up by the courts under the Sherman Act, correct me if I'm wrong, the companies did the restructuring themselves. His answer was totally spot on, the Federal government says ""that's enough power for you"", not ""here is how we're going to internally change your company"".

"6059","1460732583","Sanders' supporters won't likely listen to criticisms of him.  Unfortunately, this article is right on.  Now, if Sanders' purpose is to fuel his supporters, he more or less was successful at that.  He did what his supporters more or less expected him to do.  But to voters on the fence, his manner came off as being rude and probably condescending.  A lot of snarky remarks and finger pointing won't be perceived positively (let alone directed at a woman) by objective undecided voters.

To me, last night Sanders won when he challenged Clinton to release the transcripts.  She was clearly evasive.  But his sarcastic remarks were a turn off.  Clinton won in portraying herself was someone who could get things done.  Two particular points she made were convincing: one is about the minimum wage (she would sign a $15 minimum wave if the bill was on her desk, but to get there, you couldn't do it in one step) and fracking (her explanation how foreign countries have go to through fracking first before getting to green energy was convincing).

On Israel and Palestinian, I found Sanders' statements very eloquent (he can't explain his position better than that).  Unfortunately, the entire tone came off as not being supportive of Israel as Clinton.  It would win the Palestinian vote in NY.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.

Overall, Sanders' supporters will vote for him. Clinton's supporters will vote for her.  For those people on the edge, I think Clinton did a little better.  I thought Clinton's closing remarks were very effective.  She was very appealing to NYers who voted her to the Senate.  She was asking them and talking to them directly.

&gt;CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process:
“Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturday’s 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.”

Not sure how much I'm buying this but for what it's worth that's what their official statement is on the mix up/~~fraud~~/unofficial delegate count in CO. "

"6116","1460518395","I wish candidates would stop citing ""contributions"" as a statistic. It's totally meaningless.

The impressive stats Sanders has, in real life, are:

- total # of contributors
- total # of contributors whose total donations per quarter are below $200
- average per-quarter donation
- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

This is also why Hillary pushes for $1 donations, it's specifically so she can cite that one garbage stat."

So there are two possible conclusions: 

1) Bernie isn't that great of a campaigner, compared with Obama. He has more money on hand but can't translate that into votes. Maybe his campaign isn't run as well or isn't as astute as Obama's '08 campaign.

2) Money's influence in politics isn't absolute. Maybe money helps a campaign but can't fix all of a candidate's hurdles.

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

&gt;Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

&gt;Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

&gt;Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

&gt;Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

&gt;Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.

Their goals are to turn our country into a fundamentalist theocratic oligarchy, ""clarifying"" that the First Amendment only applies to fundamentalist Old Testament religion, banning abortion and contraceptives, banning gay marriage, eliminating the voting for members of the Senate, and otherwise reversing decades of progress. Back to an imaginary time when black Americans and women couldn't vote, there weren't brown people in the US, and gays were back in the closet. "

"6264","1460578842","From Verizon's 10K:

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel Transaction. The 2014 effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership prior to the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

So even if you don't want to believe Verizon's press release which is an appropriate assumption, their filing is audited by a third party and signed off by CEO and CFO under the threat of jail for its not accurate. They don't mess around with SEC filings. "

&gt;Bertha Oliva compared the current situation to the early 1980s, when the CIA funded, armed, and trained Honduran government death squads that murdered hundreds of opposition activists.

and:
&gt;“When we first began in 1982, we faced death squads,” said Oliva, also speaking through a translator. “Now, it’s like going back to the past. We know there are death squads in Honduras.”

also:
&gt;The coup was accompanied by a huge rise in political violence. By 2012, state security forces had assassinated more than 300 people, and 34 members of the opposition and 13 journalists had disappeared, according to data compiled by Honduran human rights organizations. The political assassinations added to the emboldened violence from gangs and drug traffickers, making Honduras one of the most dangerous countries in the world. In 2012, Reuters reported that it had the highest murder rate of any country.

&gt;Although the murder rate has since declined, political violence in Honduras has continued. Since the end of 2012, at least 22 prominent environmental activists have been killed, according to Global Witness.

"6414","1460640210","&gt;But I was struck, in our conversation, by the frequency with which Carter framed today's world within those same dynamics that had preoccupied his early career: great power rivalries, nuclear weapons, and the power of deterrence to keep the world in line.

&gt;It's not that he's unconcerned with terrorism or rogue states, both of which he discussed at length. But he clearly drew from his experiences in the 1980s and '90s an acute sensitivity to the world-shaking stakes of great power rivalries, and a firm belief in the role that deterrence and nuclear weapons still play.

&gt;Carter described a world where not just American power but also global peace and stability will be increasingly challenged by other powers. He returned over and over to the same answer to this problem: the power of deterrence, backed up by overwhelming American superiority and, ultimately, by nuclear weapons.

&gt;But deterrence works on decades-old understandings of warfare that are, today, rapidly changing. As countries develop new tools and techniques of war, Carter warned that deterrence, the foundation on which American power and global stability are built, needs to change as well.

&gt;That is not a challenge that grabs as many headlines as terrorism or rogue states. But the stakes — the international order as know it, 70 years of peace between the major powers, and the thousands of nuclear warheads backing it up — could not be higher.

The pollutants generated from the mass manufacture of solar panels can also be pretty nasty and harmful to the environment, though it's getting better all the time. 

Additionally, the fundamental piece missing from renewables is you can't control them to work when you want.  In a 100% renewable generation profile, where will your power come from in the middle of the night when the wind isn't blowing. You can't make it blow, and can't make the sun shine.

Put more simply, if it's not windy, you need to have enough fossil fuel plants to serve the full public demand.   

Therefore, whatever the cost of wind is, it is almost entirely in addition to the cost of fossil fuel power generation.   The only savings is that when supplying wind power you save on the coal/gas/oil you would have been burning, but you still have to pay for the plant while it sits idle (or runs at less output).

I can understand that she has a fine line to tread between the businesses and people backing her, but, ""Of the People, by the People, for the People,"" should always be the tie-breaker when that conflict arises, bottom line.

"6500","1460473907","There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

This whole scheme - including this very article - seems geared toward privatizing education via ""charter schools"" - basically private schools using public dollars, the holy grail of crony capitalism. "
"6501","1460472675","Interesting last paragraph.

&gt;Bill Clinton framed his wife’s position in remarkable terms: “She thinks [the tests] are just too much, that it’s national overreach,” he said, “and the most it could ever do is to help people at the very bottom levels of achievement.” Turn that last passage over in your head and consider its meaning: The most it could ever do is to help people at the very bottom levels of achievement. As if helping people at the bottom is so insignificant that it’s not worth doing. What a thing for a Democrat to say!

"
"6502","1460482222","So what I get from the article is that Clinton isn't in favor of a standardized test every year and that money would be better spent training and paying teachers.

&gt;""The idea of having to give a national test every year for five years in a row for people from the third to the eighth grade doesn’t make as much sense as investing the same amount of money in helping the teachers to be better teachers.""

She's such a fucking monster."

http://www.newsday.com/opinion/hillary-clinton-at-newsday-long-island-transcript-1.11680010

Newsday's website is subscription only, but I will post as much as I think I safely can under the doctrine of fair use:

&gt;Filler: So, New York and Long Island don't just lead the country in property taxes, that's not our only calling card. We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

&gt;Clinton: Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-à-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime. It was very upsetting to everybody.

&gt;Filler:So you wouldn't say don't do it, you would say do it right.

&gt;Clinton:Do it right. Do it right and I would say I think we need better and fewer tests that are used for what tests should be used for, first and foremost as to how to improve the educational outcomes for individual children, for classes of children, and for schools of children.

&gt;Filler: Should they be used at all to determine whether teachers are being successful?

&gt;Clinton: I think given the state of where testing is right now, I don't think they're good enough to make that determination."

"6508","1460475136","Yeah, this is a good thing. Sorry, but the amount of emphasis placed on testing in the current environment is ridiculous. Kids aren't actually learning anything except how to cram names and dates into their head for one time usage on a test. 

This may actually be one of the first times I've seen the national testing agenda cast as sound progressive policy. A few years ago progressives were falling all over themselves to condemn No Child Left Behind and the emphasis it placed on national testing. Now Clinton's education stance is anti-progressive for opposing the testing culture?"
"6509","1460486343","If you buy the suspect premise of the article that Hillary's refusal to condemn New York's massive (and [massively popular](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/12/nyregion/the-growing-strength-of-new-yorks-opt-out-movement-maps.html?_r=1)) standardized testing ""opt-out"" movement is the equivalent of ""abandoning education reform"" then you should probably know that Sanders has similarly refused to condemn the opt-out movement and has a lengthy history of opposition to standardized testing with language that mirrors the New York opt-outs' own criticisims of the practice:

&gt;I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001, and continue to oppose the bill's reliance on ***high-stakes standardized testing*** to direct draconian interventions. In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on ***standardized testing***, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.

http://www.aft.org/election2016/candidate-questionnaire-bernie-sanders#sthash.8IqrvlNW.dpuf

It doesn't really matter in either case because, like millions of New York parents, both Clinton and Sanders can obviously be concerned about education reform and still be against standardized testing as currently implemented.

"6517","1460507334","It is for all of these reasons stated below that in Europe, they have different levels of high school; tracking not only classes but entire schools. The reality is that you can't teach students that have such a range of ability level. It is just as ridiculous to expect a low achieving students to be able to do the same as a high achieving student ( or intelligent, a word you may never use in the educational system as eveeybody is the same apparently) as it is to expect a 5ft 60lbs girl to wrestle a 6ft 200lbs guy and be competitive. People are limited by their abilities; a good teacher, like a sports coach may have a 10% impact but it can't make a weak student strong. It is ridiculous to hold teachers or schools  accountable for the grades of their students. At our school, we have a large number of immigrants who barely speak english. Their score count the same as those of native speakers. It is all part of the American notion that everybody can achieve anything as long as they work hard. This is high,y naive: students can reach the goals they set for themselves, based on their interests and ability by working hard.
The downside of the European system is that it creates a class society where people at a young age are labeled and start acting and oerforming accordingly. Also, the level of the teachers at the lower level schools is lower because frankly most teachers don't want to work there, because of the behavioral issues. The other downside is that it is negatively biased towards boys, who tend to be behind in development and organizational skills, compared to their female peers. I know tons of freshmen that would have been put in the lower level schools because they can't even bring a pencil with them, who turned out responsible and dilligent seniors a few years later. 
Both systems have their challenges and both do a disservice to large secrion of the student body."
"6518","1460476300","Education reform is and has been a shitbasket. Not to say the current system isn't in need of reform, but the reform that was being peddled was and is bad. Do you want a system where teachers are mearly administrators of the material, or where kids sit in front of computers all day using rigid learning programs with minimal teacher interaction? 

Reform usually comes in the form of busting teacher unions. How is the system going to get better if the focus is on reducing the number of teachers and reducing pay. "

This made it especially disgusting for me when the military had their budget reduced, and their immediate reaction was to cut tuition assistance for servicemen.

&gt; Bunnatine (Bunny) H. Greenhouse is a former chief contracting officer Senior Executive Service (Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. On June 27, 2005, she testified to a Congressional panel, alleging specific instances of waste, fraud, and other abuses and irregularities by Halliburton with regard to its operations in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. She described one of the Halliburton contracts (secret, no-bid contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR)—a subsidiary of Halliburton) as ""the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career"".[1]

&gt; A long-time government employee, Greenhouse was hired by Lieutenant General Joe Ballard in 1997 to oversee contracts at the Army Corps of Engineers. After Ballard retired in 2000, Greenhouse's performance reviews, which had been exemplary throughout her public career, suddenly soured. Greenhouse filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint alleging race and gender discrimination, which her attorney states has never been investigated. In August 2005, she was demoted in what her lawyer called an ""obvious reprisal"" for her revelations about the Halliburton contracts.[2][3]

As a matter of course, the standard assumption is that everything they say is dishonest or at best a half-truth. Sadly, this is not a hyperbolic statement or exaggeration in any way. Which is especially frustrating because there are so many very knowledgeable people who know law, Constitution, research studies, and history, who can accurately discuss public policy and even societal root causes. Heck, a huge number of laymen know the subject matter far, far better than most Democrats attempting to make public policy and law. Take time to ponder that.

To give you an idea of how completely backwards political arena is on firearms, consider the following. When people want expert opinion, they go to experts. When Democrats want expert opinion on firearms and policy, they go to politicians. Which is painfully obvious why, as the experts contradict just about everything Democrat politicians have to say on the subject. Which brings us full circle to my opening sentence.

edit: clarified I'm speaking of Democrat politicians."
"6689","1460477183","So Vermont definitely has issues with guns leaving their state illegally. This wasn't a very strong attack because it doesn't apply to New York in the same numbers. But Vermont is *per-capita* responsible for the most guns recovered in other states in general. 

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-vermont-guns-responsible-for-new-york-violence/

&gt;Her statistics come from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issued a report in 2013 saying **Vermont was in fact, adjusted for population, the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states.** That year, 23.5 guns per 100,000 residents, or a total of 147, were recovered in crimes committed outside of Vermont. The next-highest per capita state was New Hampshire, with 22.3 guns per 100,000 residents.

&gt;An ATF report from 2014 put Vermont in the top 15 states whose guns were recovered in New York. Still, it's worth noting that guns from Vermont are just a tiny fraction of the overall number of out-of-state guns recovered there: that year, Vermont's guns were 55 of the total 4,585 out-of-state guns. In the same year Georgia was the source for 386 out-of-state guns and 395 were traced to Virginia.

Here is her quote- ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest **per capita** number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""

So she was wrong about the New York part. But it is true that per- capita, Vermont is the number one source of guns recovered in other states. Which doesn't sound good, but obviously there aren't very many people in Vermont. "

As it turns out, *New York* is the state's leading source of illegal guns.  And using a per capita measure is like comparing sourced guns to the number of cattle in a state, or its milk production, or the miles of railroad track.  It's an arbitrary statistic that has no bearing on the number of illegal firearms that enter from out-of-state.

&gt; The fact that Kelly and Band were laying the groundwork for their enterprise while Kelly was working for the State Department, reported here for the first time, represents a fresh illustration of the blurring of the lines between Hillary Clinton’s political network and her State Department that critics have long noted. **And it shows how one enterprising fundraiser was able to insinuate himself into Clinton's inner circle and then built a 500-person, multinational consulting firm whose value, at least at first, was greatly enhanced by its founders’ closeness to the Clintons.**

From this you can see almost as many guns come from California as do from VT... which is over 2438 miles away as apposed to VT which borders the state of NY.  Almost 7 times as many guns make it to NY from PA as from VT.

As a fun way to show that Hillary Clinton is just making fun data stats into pretend causality correlation, I've done the math that shows on the east coast states with lower total cow populations actually had less guns that were used in NY.

Some argue that big names such as Clinton are not persuaded by money due to their enormous influence and already established wealth, but this is very much *not* true for lesser known politicians. If anything, giving politicians and the democratic party MORE money from such groups is exacerbating an already existing problem. They will be knocking on doors for favors once elections are done.

Also, why do you think doing the same strategy of fundraising that's lost us both sides of congress, as well as numerous gubernatorial and legislative branches across the nation, will suddenly start to win? There is a massive progressive movement that has begun, made up of millions of people OUTSIDE the party and young people who don't typically vote. If the Democrats could harness that energy, and seal up up these votes in elections, that in itself would lend enormous power to taking back Congress. 

Some people mock Sanders for putting his need of getting things done in Congress partially on this movement, but the fact of the matter is that without it and regardless of who is in the White House, we can assure ourselves that a repeat of obstructionism we've seen for the last several years will continue. Democrats suck at getting people to vote for them at lower level elections, how does  doing the same exact thing we did before change that?"

It's so important that the first amendment of the US Constitution protects this institution from state usurpation.

&gt;The reality is that Clinton’s plan would barely scratch the surface of the issue. Her proposals are aimed at Citizens United, but as we established, that’s a small piece to a much larger problem. If the Democratic front-runner got her way, corporations would have to disclose their political donations. However, the heart of the matter is far more complex. Her plan doesn’t change that money is speech, nor does it involve tightening the rules of what constitutes “social welfare.” It does not do anything towards regulating 501c4 nonprofits, which would still be able to hide their donors. “Issue advocacy” would still be largely unchecked. Like in the example I gave above, wealthy individuals like the Koch Brothers, who are corporate interests, would still be able to run political “issue” ads through nonprofits with benign names, hiding their identities while pushing a corporate agenda. These individuals would not have to disclose their spending because they are not corporations, nor are they necessarily spending on politics."

Uh oh.  I'm guessing Americans are super upset with the AP now that they've called them all ignorant, right?

At least, that's what Hillary's supporters always tell me on reddit when I bring it up...."

"7216","1460655902","I was saying this the other day.  It is the exact path we go down when/if abortion becomes illegal.  Also, if you're willing to prosecute women who have illegal abortions, what stops you from investigating miscarriages as potential homicides?"
"7217","1460659054","You have to punish people who perform illegal abortions. Just like you would punish an unlicensed doctor performing surgery.


&gt; The hard truth for those who would outlaw abortion is that no one really wants to see mom or sis (or the other 700,000 women who have an abortion each year) in the dock. Three in 10 women in the U.S. will have an abortion during their reproductive years, so while many people think they don’t know anyone who has had an abortion, the numbers suggest that probably isn’t the case.

This number is too high. We have to make birth control management better. We need to innovate it. This number is high because American women are not being responsible with birth control. "
"7218","1460661155","what trump actually said ""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,"" Trump said. ""The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed"".  of course if something was made illegal then the law should be enforced. I'm tired of the media biased towards candidates they don't support.

It's a good thing people aren't taking this as an opportunity to be incredibly petty.  I mean, the Republicans are tearing their party apart, I'm relieved that Dems aren't doing their best to do the same."
"7228","1460564243","Hilarious that she drops the campaign trail for days to make enough money to catch up to Bernie's record number of donations.
