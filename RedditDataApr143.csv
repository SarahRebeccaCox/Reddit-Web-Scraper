"117","1460667359","&gt;Using the salary data supplied by the Clinton campaign, we looked at median and average salaries for men and women in Clinton’s office year by year and found relatively minor differences. In five out of the seven years, the median salaries were slightly lower for women without Clinton’s salary included. But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

For wage discrepancies though, it's been studied and reported on quite a bit (to the attention of very few here) that women are paid the same for the same jobs when their experience and the etc. is the same.

As per [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/karinagness/2016/04/12/dont-buy-into-the-gender-pay-gap-myth/#2ce5481f4766):
&gt;Using the statistic that women make 78 cents on the dollar as evidence of rampant discrimination has been debunked over and over again. That statistic doesn’t take into account a lot of choices that women and men make—education, years of experience and hours worked—that influence earnings.

All planned to vote for Sanders. It shouldn't matter much as Hillary won by a blowout in this state, but it still happened. 

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana. If I called breathlessly to a local election official with how several people I know plus dozens upon dozens of people on Internet were disenfranchised, it would all be shrugged off.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues."

I pretended not to be registered and looked over the form and sure enough ""Republican"" was checked off on all of the forms in their possession. I told them then that I was already registered as an independent, that party affiliation was NOT required to vote and that these people were obviously lying, and I said it loudly enough that everyone around could hear me. They got up and walked away immediately. I found a campus security officer close by and told them that the people were scamming students and they told me there was nothing they could or would do about it. A year or so later I read about similar situations in an article I found online and contacted the author...I don't know if similar shenanigans are afoot here but it sounds suspicious as hell."

"265","1460652034","I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;In my relatively short career on Wall Street, I’ve watched us lurch from crisis to crisis – from the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, the dot-com bubble, post-9/11 – without exactly learning our lesson.”

&gt;After all that, Black came to the conclusion that “capitalism works better if we don’t have a class of banks who take all the reward and none of the risk.” And like Ryan, he thinks the fallout of that disparity is written all over New York city.

Edit: added a little more clarification to ""drug addict"" sentence"
"342","1460665549","I actually work as an Analyst in downtown Manhattan for a too-big-to-fail firm (26 years old so I'm still kind of young). I want Sanders to win. I can't stand this industry - most people here have no more talent or skills than the next guy (aside from Quants and Programmers). They think they're specialized but honestly it's just big words/acronyms - simple concepts. Anyone can learn to run a regression, balance sheet accounting rules, etc. It's really not rocket science.

People from my team were recently laid off so there's even more work per person. Companies can afford to pay us more (or hire more) and still make a decent margin but no, they want to meet the outrageous margins investors demand.

We need banks, insurance companies, and ratings agencies to facilitate growth in the economy. It just seems rigged sometimes. I really want Bernie to win - these dudes getting paid six figures are BARELY more talented than an editor making books etc.

Superdelegates should not be taken into account until the last vote has been counted for the pledged delegates.

It's annoying that Trump and Bernie supporters are throwing flaming fits because they didn't bother to figure out the rules of the game while other candidates did.  Not that I wouldn't like reform in my home state for the stuff that should be changed in both party's systems but it's not all evil cause there has to be a structure to select candidates.
 
TLDR; The Colorado election process is a complex game best played by people who understand the rules.  Trump didn't figure them out but Cruz did.  I'm a Democrat, I have no skin in the Republican's game so I'm not defending them. I'm also not arguing either party has a great process, both need reform but they're not rigged here.

I'm of the same mindset as robert reich who said she's a good candidate for the system we have now but bernie is the candidate for the government we need.

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

One thing I do like about the primaries is that in most cases it is not winner take all. I would actually like to see the general election adopt a similar rule where state's electoral votes are awarded proportionally to the popular vote of that state."

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;&gt;    a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

"914","1460656496","To be fair: this is the required spin at this point.  You can never admit that your campaign is ""over"" if you want your supporters to keep showing up to vote.

Sanders isn't going to win a majority of pledged delegates, but Clinton's pledged delegate total won't be an absolute majority either.  So technically the nomination cannot be decided until the superdelegates cast their ballots in July, so all his supporters should keep fighting.

Obviously what actually happens is that the instant the polls close in DC on the final primary (and realistically somewhat before) the horse trading phase of the nomination starts.  Sanders will get what concessions he can from Clinton behind closed doors, and then suspend his campaign and endorse her."

To go out of the country for almost two days just a few days before the NY primary is dumbfounding, especially when Bernie has shown multiple times that the more time he spends campaigning in a state before the voters vote, the better he ends up doing. Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do. As a Bernie supporter, I'd prefer he'd skip the speech, and spend the time campaigning in NY instead."

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

I'm all for privacy, but if you commit a crime don't you forfeit that right to some extent?  Shouldn't we, as a society, have some mechanism for catching criminals and enforcing laws?  Why should we make it easier for the outlaws and scumbags of our society to hide their activity?

I understand the client-side encryption angle, but it seems that at the end of the day providers wouldn't be held liable for users implementing features not offered by their service.  It would be like the government suing the telephone company because I used their phone line to deal drugs.  They can ask for and subpoena call logs, but can't sue the phone company for my behavior.

Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning."

* Massachusetts has ~1/3 of New York's population, but has open primaries. This shows either the huge opportunity for either candidate to drive voter turnout on Tuesday, or just how much closed primaries affect turnout, or both.

"1057","1460660064","&gt; Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job. Let's not make ovaries a requirement of high office--just like we wouldn't make religion or race or whatever. "

"1070","1460647105","As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it.

I feel like the whole concept of a career is completely changing and my generation won't ever see the kind of working environment that generations before us have. Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily.

"1256","1460615853","Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"

"1388","1460588235","The scarier thing about all of this (I mean, really who gives a fuck if yet another latin american banana republic has a forced change of leadership?) is hillary's fluency in revisionist policy.

1 - either she knew about US involvement in the coup and was willing to parrot back party line

or 

2 - she was oblivious and just willing to violate US law"

"1390","1460625392","So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

&gt; Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, “so messed up”.

Mainly the utility poles, trenches and limited usable frequencies that all traverse public space to connect us all together.  It is very similar to our interstates and roadways.  Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

But think about this.  If he keeps going and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you, and you better hope that there’s someone left to help you.”

In my opinion this is a fantastic idea, and the best shot it's had at passing in a very long time. There are a few monkey wrenches people will point out:

1. What about people whose employers send out W-2s (or other documents) late or with incorrect information? Employers won't like the potential for liability on their part.

2. If they eventually get you to pay your late taxes, governments make a LOT from penalty and interest. Will be interesting to see whether they view this as lost income, on balance."

Having said that, the new online site they create will undoubtedly suck, because every other website the IRS (and most government agencies) has ever created is a total fucking disaster. And the states are even worse.

And if you have a problem using the new IRS online filing website, who you gonna call? Yeah, that's what the IRS needs, a bunch of computer novices who are using their new website because they don't want to pay for the non-free services clogging up the IRS phone lines whixch are already so clogged that only 37% of callers get through, and only after waiting an average of 27 minutes.

I know that nuclear power is generally considered safe, but accidents can and do happen, and by increasing the exposure to that risk we greatly increase our chances of a catastrophic event.

But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill.

Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana!

So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

TL;DR Read the fucking thing. It's important!

edit: 50 growers means 50 lobbyists. Not 25."
