Considering a good part of the anti-Hillary jib is how interventionist she is, it's downright hilarious that people are making this an issue. 

The Honduran military ousted a would-be dictator on the orders of the Honduran Supreme Court. So... bluntly, get the fuck out of here with this bullshit. What, should we have stepped in to help him become El Presidente for life? Is being more hands-off on Latin American affairs than any Presidential administration in living memory a *bad* thing now?

*The 2009 Honduran coup d'état, part of the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis,[1][2] occurred when the Honduran Army on orders from the Honduran Supreme Court ousted President Manuel Zelaya and sent him into exile on 28 June 2009.[3] It was prompted when Zelaya attempted to schedule a non-binding poll on holding a referendum about convening a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.*

Bernie Sanders has held elective office for almost all of the last 35 years. He was first elected to Congress in 1990, which was 26 years ago. (Clinton wasn't elected to Congress, her first and only elected office, until 2000, 10 years later.)

"216","1460544125","Of course they fear them. It's unusual for a candidate with such low approval ratings to win the election. If there had been a republican candidate that was seen as moderate and likeable he or she would wipe the floor with Hillary.

I mean, Trump is just a few points less liked than Hillary. And he has momentum, and she does not. He is talking about issues most of America agrees with him on, and Hillary is dragged down by all her baggage. Her campaign is like a very slowly deflating balloon by now. Trump tones it down a notch, acts more presidential once he has secured the nomination and he will end up being more likeable than Hillary."

She might win the primaries but she's going to be a fucking nightmare candidate for the general election and make it much more difficult to win then it should be. It's one thing to say that she has baggage But at this point she's got a car full of baggage she's dragging around with her and it's really impossible for the average low information voter to not notice. 

This is in part what Bernie supporters have been trying to point out for over 6 months. "
"218","1460565179","I love how they presume that she will be the democratic nominee regardless... Lol.

Also, the reasons why she has such a high unfavourability rating isn't just because 'over the years ' people have tried to delegitimise her. It's because her politics suck. Who voted for the Iraq war? Who called black people super predators? Who supported Goldwater? Who was against gay marriage until it became popular? That's right, Hillary fucking Clinton.


This article seems to completely ignore these facts, and treat clintons dissaproval ratings as an inevitable outcome of a long career. Bernie has been in politics just as long and there isn't shit you can stack against him in terms of his political record.

Sidney Valentine I guess you think people are repeating the same thing because they can, rather than because it's the truth.

Solving root causes of the path and disparity our country is going through requires a rethinking of the status quo.

On the day of the debate the room fills up with a good sized audience (30-40) of people who apparently didn't know we were assigned these debate topics/positions and they weren't necessarily our own views.

Our group had to sit in front of these people while they hurled vitriolic shit at us for an hour.

We don't allow people to sue Ford, Chevy, etc. when a drunk driver hits someone and half the time we likely couldn't sue a pharma company either if a drug we willingly take hurts us unless we find unlawful practices later on involved.

The gun manufacturers are simply businesses selling their product, it's not their fault what others do with them.

There, representatives of the coup regime were placed on an equal footing with representatives of Zelaya’s constitutional government, and Costa Rican president Oscar Arias (a close U.S. ally) as mediator.  Unsurprisingly, the negotiation process only succeeded in one thing: keeping Zelaya out of office for the rest of his constitutional mandate.  "" http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/09/24/hillary-clinton-emails-and-honduras-coup"

Basically certain large banks are required to put together a plan that describes how they'll maintain liquidity if there are problems (either with them or the economy as a whole), and if they can't, how they'll unwind (go bankrupt) gracefully so they don't bring down anyone worse with them.

The banks have had years to work on this, and I don't know of a single one that's taking it seriously. The plans I'd seen read like boiler plate legalese with a few financial details thrown in. You can read the whole thing and wonder ""that was a plan??""

And regulators have agreed. It's such a simple and common sense regulation, and if they took it seriously the banks could argue that they're not too big to fail. But coming up with emergency plans doesn't make any profit, and doesn't earn anyone a big bonus, so they don't take it seriously."

The FDIC splits the banks based on customer list (ie, the customer list gets divided so there are multiple banks in the same geographic region, not regional superbanks), separates the back-end (processing and IT infrastructure) part of the company into a single entity with shares owned by all the daughter banks, and splits out the Investment bank.  The new banks are sold on public exchanges with proceeds going to the FDIC, shares issued to employees, and lastly to the former owners/creditors of the banks.  FDIC retains golden shares in all daughter banks used to block any merger activity.

You can depreciate software and hardware. Know why finance companies love leases? Those go on the books as an item they can depreciate, as you don't own the vehicle in a lease, the finance company does. 

The second part about carrying over losses is important for small businesses. The first years of a small business you won't make a profit, to not make a profit and also get taxed would crush a lot of start ups.

This is the problem with WaPo and other MSM outlets today. It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd.

How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

"712","1460555393","What a bunch of bullshit. I would get on board with the Sanders is being robbed of the nomination if he was actually winning the nomination by any measure. He isn't. He's losing the popular vote (even if you extrapolate some numbers from the caucus states) and he is losing badly in pledged delegates. If Sanders loses the nomination, while the process for the primary may have been pretty bad at the end of the day the candidate that had the most votes won.

All this bitching and moaning about how unfair everything is is just exhausting. The media discounts Sanders wins? No shit. He wins in a state that offers 20 delegates and Clinton is winning in states that offers her 200 delegates. He is over 200 pledged delegates behind Clinton. Math does not have a pro-establishment bias. No one that does the delegate math can find a reasonable likely way for Sanders to come back from his deficit (without coming up with absurd unattainable numbers).

This level of arrogance that somehow everyone that isn't voting for Sanders must be corrupt, part of the establishment, uninformed, or swindled by the big bad corporate media. It's just downright offensive. And anytime Sanders does get media coverage it must ALWAYS be positive, anything that isn't a glowing praise for Sanders is just a blatant corporate hatchet job.

Maybe if millennials actually managed to pay attention to politics for more then one election cycle things might actually change. But instead all the Bernie bros want to vote for Trump if Sanders doesn't win the nomination? What kind of nonsense is that? You believe that the minimum wage must be raised so much that if the guy you want doesn't win you want to vote for the guy who wants to abolish the minimum wage? For fucks sake... Trump isn't anti-establishment, he's pro-Trump. He's has 0 interest in changing anything, he just wants to win.

"714","1460508110","The super delegates aren't ""rigging"" the system.  They have never in their history of existence swung a nom away from the pledged delegate leader.

The reason why his 7 state win streak hasn't accounted to a huge change in the race is most of those states are smaller states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming) And the system is rarely a winner take all, and winning by a huge margin in a state worth 20 to 30 delegates isn't worth as much by winning a state worth 300 by the same margin or even a much closer one.  For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

Who is almost certainly going to get the Dem nomination? Clinton

"717","1460510197","I have been stalking this election as an outside observer to the US and it really is fascinating to me. I am utterly bemused by the lack of critical analysis of a range of sources and the ability for everyday Americans to draw their own informed and fully justified conclusion.


I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

&gt; That $1.8 billion in relief from Goldman that's supposed to help homeowners in distress? Miller says that in these cases, the terms are kept vague, and Goldman can use that money to do things that are in its best interest anyway, like writing off debt that's obviously not going to be repaid, demolish foreclosed upon houses, and modify mortgages that are in distress.

&gt;""It would be like me agreeing to be right handed all day today or to wake up tomorrow morning and have coffee,"" Miller says of the settlement agreements. ""Those things are going to happen anyway.""

&gt;He also pointed to something critics have called the ""bullshit-to-cash ratio"" as one indicator of how little the penalty will affect a giant like Goldman. Basically, it's important to note that only about $3 billion of the $5 billion will be paid out in cash. On the other hand, about half is tax-deductible and will be placed on the backs of taxpayers––even though the median American family lost about 40 percent of their wealth during the worst stretch of the crisis.

&gt;What's more, the New York Times notes that after incentives and tax credits, Goldman can chop about a billion dollars off the total penalty. According to a chart attached to the settlement, for every dollar Goldman puts into community investment in New York, they get a $2 tax credit."

"799","1460564042","One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!"
