"113","1460712225","They should have never let off of this, and I'm glad it came up at the debate.

She has had months to address this. No Democratic candidate should be able to deflect with ""I'll do it when the Republicans do it."" 

They're not the ones saying they support campaign finance reform, you are Hillary."
"114","1460715858","In regards to her speaking fees it would be nice for her supporters to at least admit there is a potential conflict of interest instead of acting like money influencing politics is an alien concept when it's come to the democrats."
"115","1460716358","Just watch her avoid it on last nights debate. Even if I supported her, I would feel dirty watching that display. It there is not a pile of incriminating statements in that speech she is absolutely insane for acting like this. You need a big imagination to find any gray area. "
"116","1460713722","The pressure will fade away, unless Bernie Sanders directly mentions it again, instead of through twitter or something"
"117","1460724290","Hillary's campaign was the first to make an issue of demanding president Obama's birth certificate. That bogus issue has dogged Obama for 8 years since.  Now she is making a fake issue of Senator Sander's taxes. She is very good at assassination by innuendo."
"118","1460727513"," What has she said in these speeches that scares her from releasing it.  I personally think she has criticised what ever little Obama has done about the banks as well as promised she will reverse it when she becomes president. That would destroy her candidacy as she has portrayed herself as someone that would take Obama's policies forward. And she has been on record saying that she wasn't planning to run for presidency when she gave those speeches."
"119","1460720807","Ultimately I believe she needs to feel the pressure from the voters before she'll ever do this.  She doesn't give two shits about this press coverage, or hash tags, or websites unless she starts to truly lose and those losses can be linked it this. Yes he won recently but NY will likely go her way bc of the bullshit closed primary and party affiliation change deadline. I keep reading that she's pressured and she seemed pissed last night at times but a NY win will chill her out quick. I hope I wrong about NY but I got too emotional after IL and FL to not be cautious. 

Further, it would have to be true desperation bc it seems like there's some BAD shit in there since they haven't been released yet. 

I'd put the liklihood that we ever see these at the same odds as my 7 year old declaring she's over Mac and Cheese. Basically zero. "
"120","1460722558","I kind of like Hillary - but why the Democratic Party allowed her to run and then backed her so strongly is beyond me. I would really like to see a women president but gender is secondary to merits. So much smoke ..."
"121","1460728258","*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton’s decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "
"122","1460720511","There are lots of things the Republicans haven't done yet, like embrace same sex marriage. 

If Clinton wanted to use Republicans as a reason not to get into something or do something, she could still hold her true beliefs that gays should not marry and just play it off like Republicans haven't done it yet. "

"129","1460729238","Her whole ""Reasoning"" for not makes me nauseous. Your not running against the republican yet Hillary, stop pretending they have anything to do with the democratic fucking primary. You want to use that bullshit in the general then fine, then it might make some sense. "

You compromise and wheedle and make get indebted to folks and they give you money and you that's how you get elected. Bernie is a crazy, weird unicorn. A Socialist independent. From Vermont.

But I also think it's right of Hillary to say that her puppet strings aren't any different than the Republican candidates -- and in fact, probably less noxious, but she doesn't want to put hers on display, because the Republican super-pacs will run with that in the general, and she doesn't need any more Negatives.

At first I thought it was probable that she'd said something innocuous-seeming but unethical. My working theory was that she'd told these groups of people that she was definitely running for president, which would have made the speaking fees FEC violations. But I decided last night, while she dodged this question multiple times, that maybe it's something else. 

Maybe those transcripts were stored on her private server along with the rest of the Clinton Foundation's documents. Maybe she can't release then because they're currently part of the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which is just one of the investigations currently underway. And if they are, then she can't really say ""Well I'd be happy to give them to you as soon as the FBI lets me.""

She cannot release the transcripts because it will sink her campaign over night and she and her advisors know this.  Bernie should've accused her relentlessly of saying one thing behind closed doors and another to the public, he should've made her so uncomfortable she had no choice but to relent and release the speeches--they would be the death knell of her campaign, when people realize how cozy she is with the big banks they are going to flee her in droves.

We are still dealing with Republicans deciding not to work with Democrats because they lost the election.  I really do not feel energized to see a candidate who only became a Democrat, so he could get the democrat money to run for President and who will not only be unable to work with Republicans but also unwilling to work with many democrats.   

I also do not see a problem with the word establishment and will be more than happy when this election is over and the word is retired.   Sanders has been in government for a long time and the only reason he is not ""establishment"" is because he refuses to work with people and get things done.

I also could not believe that on the topic of the Supreme Court nominations that Clinton brough up Roe v. Wade and what it is to be a woman and how women need rights.

She CREATED a conflict of interest. It was her decision. No one else made it for her. Politicians (universally) need to be transparent and disclose all potential conflicts of interest and this undoubtedly qualifies."

"182","1460696103","Heres the thing about Hillary. She isnt much worse than any other politician out there. *Everyone* is corrupt. And compared to a lot of the corrupt politicians, Hillary isnt too bad. Thats why she thinks she's justified in not releasing the transcripts. Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change. 

If I could give Hillary one piece of advice, it would be this: Forget about yourself, remember America."

Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-05-20/news/9102270272_1_nra-officials-brady-bill-powerful-gun).)

He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

"330","1460715245","I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."

"333","1460709046","Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"

&gt;The wage would increase more gradually upstate, hitting **$12.50 in six years.**

Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country. Our founders wanted the soldier's, and the king's taxes, out. It was not about establishing a Christian nation. They drank, they whored, they swore. They were men. Normal men.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus?

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

"534","1460724998","The reason Bernie is winning, is because he cares. He doesn't act like a politician, he acts like a human. Great movements in America have always required being human before being a politician. Hillary is getting huge sums of money for being a Clinton.  She says she represents the people,  but she isn't talking about her ideas. She criticizes Bernie's ideas, and tries to find loopholes. When I watch her, it almost seems like she is arguing in court trying to use long articulated sentences while replying to simple questions.   She acts like what's done is done, and that these changes Bernie speaks of shouldn't be attempted.  In the 1700s, England was in its prime, and mighty.  The colonists were at their mercy, yet they stood up, and fought for what they believed in despite the situation being ""imlossible."" When Lincoln dropped the emancipation proclamation on the world, much of the United States didn't support this, he was even assassinated.  Here we are now.  To us common plebs it just appears as though Clinton is running for office because she wants to add that to her biography.   Sanders wants to/acts like he wants to make a difference. "

She's a poor rhetorician in a number of ways: her voice is shrill; her rhythm is flat; and her expression swings from serious to bemused to annoyed to offended. She also tends to dissemble. A lot. You see it when she begins a sentence with, ""I've always"" or ""my entire life"" or ""I've never"". It's simply not possible for a person to have always held a simple position on a complex issue such as the second amendment, social security, abortion. There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur.""

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."

&gt;Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, an Argentine and one of Francis’ key advisers at the Vatican, said he was aware of but disputed the perception that the pope disliked the United States. Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said. Francis recently helped negotiate a historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations that has led to restored diplomatic ties between the countries."

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "
"647","1460681953","Maybe because everyone is sick and tired of endless election year protests manufactured to grab headlines in promotion of one progressive cause after another, and the reporters know it? Just a thought."
"648","1460713934","...Um.

&gt; What I said was, Jeff, to clear the record and I think you'll agree on this, the danger of taking money from any interest is that you're not so aggressive in going after them, let's face it that's the real problem and I think we can agree on that.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.

But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

It is Democrats who refuse to simplify the tax code while bitching and moaning that corporations pay no taxes... they need the wedge issue to whip the rank and file left in an outraged lather...

Besides, that there is the $1 trillion which was supposed to go for infrastructure but instead went where? - shored up public pensions.

"1076","1460701278","Most aren't denying the importance of infrastructure.  Most are debating the methods which should be used to pay for it.  The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

"1089","1460711369","Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

"1129","1460711369","Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

"1221","1460694136","National polls don't mean a lot right now, I think.  I believe it is the pollong on the coming primary states that really matter.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released.

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.

"1496","1460652034","I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;After all that, Black came to the conclusion that “capitalism works better if we don’t have a class of banks who take all the reward and none of the risk.” And like Ryan, he thinks the fallout of that disparity is written all over New York city.

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.

One of these executive orders, Action #14, noted that “in addition to being a law enforcement challenge, gun violence is also a serious public health issue that affects thousands of individuals, families, and communities across the Nation” (White House, 2013b). This order directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other relevant federal agencies, to immediately begin identifying the most pressing research problems in firearm-related violence with the greatest potential for broad public health impact...""

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

"1766","1460646328","&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

"2160","1460606262","This comment section smells like sweat and desperation from a bunch of Hilary supporters.

You do realize that by insulting these people, encouraging Hilary to insult these people. You risk her losing their vote if she wins the primaries. 

Anyways, words like : Commie, Socialist, Atheist, etc..aren't really insults in the eyes of people under 30. We didn't live through the cold war. I see my father call him a socialist and then be like that's that. But you gotta see that people who weren't alive or of age during the cold war don't have that stigmatization about Socialism or Communism. That's not gonna be enough to deter Bernie's supporters."

"2162","1460639036","&gt;Paul Song, the executive chairman of the progressive Courage Campaign, told the crowd that his family was split between support for Clinton and Sanders. He then called on ""corporate Democratic whores"" to be defeated and replaced by ""Berniecrats.""

"2167","1460608955","Honest question to Hillary supporters. What is your honest opinion of these Sanders rallies?? Do you guys think rallies are bad or meaningless? "
"2168","1460608208","Bernie absolutely needs these to translate into votes. The thing that made Obama so powerful was that he could draw crowds *and* get votes. If he can't translate huge rallies into actually joining the electoral process, for this cycle, it is all for naught.

He's creating energy, but is it kinetic or potential? Only one will actually help him get elected."
"2169","1460625627","How come there is nothing about this on CNN? "
