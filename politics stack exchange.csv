Like. At all.


  We Want An End To The Robbery
  By The Capitalists Of Our Black Community.


That's point number three of the Ten-Points Program, a manifesto written by Black Panther founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. I don't know how much more direct you can make it.

The Black Panthers were Marxists, students of a school of conflict sociology. AnCaps and other neoliberals will characterize an essential conflict in government vs. private interest, but that is not, precisely, fundamental to the Marxist conceit. Rather, the essential conflict is class based, with capitalism being the most recent development in exploitation. For Marxists like the Black Panthers, racism is not just some kind of hateful whimsy that only becomes violently destructive when the government jackboots get in on it. Rather, it is itself a product of capitalist self-interest. 

You've heard of how ""workers must seize the means of production,"" right? In chattel slavery, such as was practiced in the American South, the workers are indistinguishable from the means of production; they're owned as property in exactly the same commodified manner as a plantation field or a cotton 'gin. Racist exclusion was no less useful for maintaining an exploitable underclass after the civil war, either. For example, the prisoner leasing programs provided slaves-in-all-but-name as a direct byproduct of racist belligerence among law enforcement. The draft during the Vietnam War press-ganged thousands of young men to fight the enemies of capitalism, but passed over people who were in university, which, generally speaking, did not include a lot of black people. Finally, because obviously there are also plenty of working-class white people, racism is a method of division which foils any effective anti-capitalist sentiment by stirring up proletariat infighting.

Pursuant to the last point, I'll also note that, as time went on, the Panters curved away from Black Nationalism and into Revolutionary Internationalism. Yes, the Black Panthers were anti-establishment, but not because they were merely laissez-faire. They were anti-establishment because, in their opinion, the establishment in question was a longstanding edifice of capitalist values. The answer, for them, is not to simply open up a power vacuum where that government stood, if it just means that the consolidated power of the bourgeois withstands the move to ""anarchy"" and starts cutting deals to trade food to people in return for their eternal bondage. That's just a regression. Rather, to the Black Panthers (and other Marxist groups), the answer is solidarity among the exploited class and opposition to the ideologies which created a class disparity, of which racial disparity is only one kind. That doesn't mean you don't have a government. For many, it means you run one.

So, to answer your question:


  Why don't black people embrace anarcho-capitalism when it would encourage groups like the Black Panthers?


Because the only way an anarcho-capitalist encourages an actual Black Panther is by provoking him.

"2016-04-15 02:00:36","There are some elected officials who choose not to use a holy book.

Notably, John Quincy Adams recounted that he had used a volume of constitutional law, with the implication that he was swearing on the principles of constitutionalism itself. Franklin Pierce did not swear an oath at all, exercising the nuance of a constitutionally-mandated option to merely affirm the oath. 

That this distinction was honored is, itself, important, because there actually is a difference. By definition, swearing is a divine invocation. This is a point of some religious significance to sects such as the Anabaptists, who foreswear the taking of oaths in compliance with the Sermon on the Mount. Keep in mind that the reason some of these sects put down roots in the New World in the first place was to escape religious disenfranchisement. So, owing to the same impulse as the First Amendment, Article II of the constitution recognizes that is not necessary to swear an oath, because it would be a point of religious qualification. Contrariwise, you might look to the example of Charles Bradlaugh, an English parliamentarian-elect who was found incapable of swearing an oath (and thus, qualifying for his office) because he didn't believe in the god that he was required to swear it to!

What I'm getting at, here, is that all of these people who have sworn oaths on the bible have done entirely so because it was their personal choice, not because any of it (even the swearing itself) is mandatory. In theory, anyway. Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon were both Quakers, which would ostensibly direct them to affirm. Nonetheless, they both conformed to convention and chose to swear. Could this indicate a de-facto religious pressure on the office of President? Well, yeah, of course, but it's also possible that neither of those men placed much importance by the nuance. Times change. 

Either way, if one does make the choice to swear in, it is only natural to substantiate it upon a holy text.

We may have Washington to blame.

For some of the prominence of such conventions, that is. You see, the actual content of the President's inaugural oath is constitutionally mandated:


  Before he enters the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""


Wait, is something missing? As related by Washington Irvine, our first President apparently thought so. After he took the oath, he kissed the bible he'd sworn on and intoned ""so help me god!"" Concluding with such words remains a tradition to this day, though it is of course completely extraneous to that which is directed by law.

"2016-04-15 04:35:40","FiveThirtyEight did a reasonably good job of analyzing this for the bound delegates.  It doesn't really cover the unbound delegates.  

I'm not going to repeat the analysis they give there.  It is certainly possible for Trump to make it to 1237 purely with bound delegates.  He would need to win 479 of the 744 remaining or 64%.  But their analyses suggests that he will fall about 80 short.  Assuming that there are about 200 unbound delegates on the first ballot, he would therefore need about 40% of them to make a majority.  

So Trump either needs to outperform their expectations by about 20% or he needs to convert enough unbound delegates to make up the difference.  

New York is an instructive example.  538's path to 1237 has Trump winning 91 of 95 delegates from New York.  But if he finishes third (or second with the first place finisher over 50%) in one district and second in another, he'd get 0 of 3 and 1 of 3 respectively.  That would take him down to 90.  Even if he finishes first in five districts but below the 50% mark, he'd only get 2 of 3 delegates in each district and fall short.  Polls show Trump with 50% to 60% of the vote statewide, averaging about 54%.  At 60% he might have enough to make 50% in each district, but at 50% he almost certainly wouldn't.  If he falls short of 91 delegates in New York, he'll have to make up those delegates elsewhere.  

I haven't seen congressional district level polls of Trump support, even though that would be what's needed to predict his vote totals in New York and other states that award delegates by congressional district results.  Most projections are going to be somewhat weak without that kind of data.  

I saw on the news today that the Trump campaign is currently projecting themselves at 1265 bound delegates.  This remains possible.  It is certainly much more likely than that Cruz will pass Trump before the convention.  But it's a steep climb.  

I don't see how Trump can expect to get more than a 100 unbound delegates on the first ballot.  That would mean that he needs at least 1137 bound delegates.  And that may give him more support than he really has.  He tends to do worse in conventions and other circumstances where people can't vote for him directly.  He might well find himself stuck at 60 unbound delegates.  That would mean that he needs 1177 bound delegates.  That's about 20 delegates ahead of the 538 projection.  

You may hear a lot of talk about rule 40b.  Most of it is rather confused.  First, Cruz has won a majority of the delegates in seven states already:  Texas; Kansas; Maine; Idaho; Utah; Wisconsin; Colorado.  He also will likely get the vote of a majority of the Louisiana delegates (having signed all ten of the unbound delegates) and seems well poised for victory in Wyoming.  Either would allow him to met the requirement.  

Second, rule 40b doesn't prevent votes for any candidates.  It prevents them from receiving floor nominations where they get to talk on television (as covered in 40c) and from having their names read in the vote count (rule 40d).  In 2012, Ron Paul was short of the eight states but he still received 190 of the first ballot votes.  While Kasich, Cruz, and other potential candidates may appreciate getting to talk on television, they won't need to talk on television to reach delegates.  They can talk to delegates directly.  

In terms of other rules, I wouldn't expect them to have much effect either.  The rules committee won't want to give the appearance of changing the rules for this election.  In fact, I suspect that they won't want to give the impression of rules affecting the election in any way.  

Trump also has the problem that if he doesn't win on the first ballot, many of his delegates (and everyone else's) become unbound.  This is why many observers think that the first ballot is his best if not only chance to win the nomination.  If he can get to 1237 then, he wins.  If not, he probably doesn't.

In Kollam district of Kerala state Kollam Hindu Temple Fireworks Blast incident took place in which More than 100 people were died. Few days before of incident taking  place, district collector and the district police commissioner of Kollam district refused permission for cracking of Fireworks . But as these 2 officer were Muslims and festival was of Hindus, some people and politicians gave it a communal color and demanded for dismissal of these 2 officer. People done celebrations with Fireworks and the bad incident took place.
In the 2nd incident where the Hindu devotee woman wanted to enter inside the core of the  another Hindu temple named as Mahalaxmi Temple in Kolhapur district of Maharashtra state for praying .But temple administration refused to permit her as they think that it is against Hindu culture. But with the Court's order the district collector and district police commissioner of Kolhapur district helped her to get inside the core of the temple.  But while entering the core of the temple the Hindu woman devotee was badly beaten by the people . Here,both these officers are from Hindu religion who helped that Hindu devotee to enter inside the Hindu temple. But after that some people as well as politicians are demanding dismissal of both district collector and district police commissioner.

There is no rule saying explicitly that having enough bound delegates to make up a majority of the delegates awards victory.

They'd be bound to vote for her on the first ballot but that wouldn't count.  Most would be unbound on later ballots and could vote for someone else.  That someone else might be Bernie Sanders but not necessarily.  They could pick someone else entirely.  

To continue, Clinton could then turn state's evidence against Donald Trump on a bribery charge.  Trump gets convicted too but has at least 1237 bound delegates.  The Republican delegates modify rule 40 to exclude votes for convicted felons.  Some of the delegates may be unbound immediately, e.g. Minnesota and Oklahoma are only bound if the candidate is nominated.  Cruz, Kasich, or some other candidate could be nominated.  

Note:  neither scenario is likely.  This is just a semi-realistic chain of events to illustrate what could happen.  

All that said, if either party did this, they'd need a really good reason to avoid a backlash.  They'd probably try hard to get a unanimous decision on the rule change so as to provide cover against charges of interfering with the election.  They'd specifically try to recruit the previous supporters of the candidate to be removed.

  Why did they think this was a good strategy to attack Bernie?


They probably didn't.  They likely thought that it would change the conversation at the time.  They had been talking about her failure to release transcripts for her speech.  As a gambit, it was mildly successful although the moderator did ignore it in the immediate followup.  

It also allowed her to make the statement that she had complied with the actual requirements while Bernie hadn't.  

I strongly suspect that the net result is going to be nothing.  Hillary supporters will stay Hillary supporters; Bernie supporters will stay Bernie supporters.  Bernie supporters will have reactions similar to yours.  Hillary supporters will say that she shouldn't make herself vulnerable to Republican attacks based on things she said in the transcripts.

Look at what happened in 2012 when a recording of Romney talking at a fundraiser was released.  The 47% statement became a meme for the Obama campaign.  

Or look at what happened with her emails.  She sent an email that Republicans use to accuse her of suborning the misuse of confidential information.  

Or her superpredator comments from 1994.  

Talking is dangerous for a politician.  She doesn't have to have been plotting a crime.  She could have simply said something that sounds bad.  For example, if she commiserates with her listeners about something, she could be accused of putting rich people problems ahead of poor people problems.

"2016-04-18 06:04:12","Added to address the new context provided by the edit

Based on the edit that provided more context as to the exchange that actually occurred, I would say three things:


His answer does a good job of addressing ways in which he thinks victims should be helped.
His answer is still lacking because it doesn't provide a plan for addressing the root cause, just for helping victims. To re-use the analogy below, he's saying that we should provide ways for victims to report being mugged, but he's not offering advice on how to reduce mugging.
The last statement he made is still troubling, even in this context, for the reasons laid out below.


Original answer below

You and some friends want to go check out an area of town that has a great restaurant, movie theater, bar, club, etc., but the location of the venues are in an area that has a reputation for being a rough part of town. Being social creatures, you really want to check this place out because you think it will be a lot of fun. Along the way you get mugged.

In this example, Kasich's advice would be,


  ""I will give you one bit of advice. Don’t go to a part of town where
  there’s a lot of crime.""


Certainly following this advice would reduce your risk of getting mugged, but it would also cause you to miss out on many social gatherings. In this example, is the problem that you went to a rough part of town, or is it that this part of town has a higher crime rate? Should our public figures be advocating avoiding that part of town or ways in which we can reduce the crime rate and improve the safety in that part of town?

Rewording the statement won't do because what was said doesn't address the actual issue, it simply offers up advice to try and avoid the problem. It's important to offer advice on how to stay safe, but it's more important to go after the root cause of what is making a situation unsafe.
","2959"
"2016-04-18 07:19:41","""Did they fail — they succeed"", answers above (which could be longer), show that your assumption is not correct. But I want to add some points:  

If we see a revolution or a movement (Arab spring, 99%,...) stopped, it doesn't mean it is failed completely. The protesters are living in the country, some of them satisfied (by media, government arguments,...)  some not; The more a government is sever, the more people will be unsatisfied. The revolution movement could resume any time.  

The ""Arab spring"" suffered from lack of leadership.  

Some reasons differs case by case:   


In Egypt: the previous ruler was overthrew and Morsi elected as President. But he failed to act as people want. (He didn't improve economy. He continued to have good relationship with Saudi Arabia and Israel). Then he lost people's support.  
In Bahrain: United States Navy base in Bahrain +  Saudi Arabia. Note that Population of Bahrain is 1300000, So a little foreign interfere can have big effect.  
In Iran: One revolution succeed in 1979. But the case what you called ""green revolution"", it was not in fact a revolution. In capital Tehran ""Mousavi"" had more votes but in the whole country ""ex-president Ahmadinejad"" had more.  Mousavi refused to accept election results and you saw protests in Tehran. In the other cities there was not serious problems; only some protests with low population. But media exaggerated it as a revolution in country (because Mousavi was pro-western and Ahmadinejad was anti-israel). I was in Northwest of Iran at the time. A friend ask me about those who (he read on the internet) killed. I said there is not even one Wounded; A surprise for him.  
In Yemen: it resulted in civil wars because of ""Saudi Arabia's interfere"" and not being united.  
In Syria: We have  world war not civil war. One side is US, EU, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, ... . Other side is Russia, Iran, Hezbollah,... ; China politically help this side.

"2016-04-18 14:56:39","One goal of the feminist movement is a society in which young women can enjoy the freedom to go to parties with lots of alcohol without being afraid of sexual assault.

While advising women to avoid this environment because it is unsafe is certainly a valid stop-gap measure to protect women from sexual assault in the short term, it comes at the cost of giving up their right to social participation. The long-term goal should be to change society in a way that people consider it a bad idea to sexually assault other people, no matter how drunk the victim or themselves.

That's why feminists react so hostilely to statements like this. The stop-gap measure is presented as a permanent solution to distract from the need for societal change. What feminists would like to hear instead is a statement like:


  ""It is unacceptable that women can not safely go to parties where there’s a lot of alcohol. That's why I propose [measures] to prevent people from committing sexual assault.""


What ""measures"" are appropriate to reach this goal is another topic we could debate about endlessly, but acknowledging that the behavior of the perpetrators should change and not that of the victims is an important first step to reach a better society for everyone (yes, also for the heterosexual men who will certainly enjoy the company of women while getting drunk).

"2016-04-18 16:28:57","There are a few reasons why people might object to what Kasich said.  


The advice requires her to give something up.  Some people like to go to parties where there's alcohol, and it's not fair that they have to give that up in order to feel safe from crime.  
Many people use ""advice"" as a way to dismiss a problem. A lot of the time, people will say ""just do x"" as a way to dismiss the problem altogether.  My personal mental prototype of this phenomenon has to do with a somewhat esoteric example where in Magic the Gathering a player can fish for information by incorrectly proposing a shortcut, and the response of the community boils down to a dismissive ""Just ask them how many tokens they're making, even if it doesn't matter"".  I personally don't think that Kasich was doing this, but I can understand how some people might associate what he said with that kind of dismissal.
It sounds similar to actual victim blaming.  Some people interpret this to be victim blaming.  I.E. ""It's your fault you got raped because you went out drinking.""  The drinking example is one of the prototypical examples of victim blaming for rape, and I have to believe that it found it's way into the zeitgeist because people have actually used it that way in the past.  I don't believe that Kasich used it in this way, but I can understand why people think about this kind of victim blaming when Kasich said what he said.

But that doesn't seem fair since the vulnerable will not have to change themselves but those that are seen as potential predators, but are not predators, would be affected.  The truth is these people are not looking for fairness they are looking for an advantage in the guise of fairness.

The truth is being very drunk makes anyone vulnerable and there is a certain subset of males who are willing to take advantage of that.  Those are both personal choices.  It is not the pack making that decision it is the individual that is doing that.

And as such they see a potential advantage here by attacking Kasich's position of personal responsibility before governmental intervention.  Certainly it does not address the perceived problem of poor sexual decisions and even predatory behavior, which is the solution they are looking for.

"2016-04-19 09:25:56","Some people seem to think that having a private insurance is good enough and the people is to blame, but reality is not that simple.

TL/DR Let's put it this way: if you do not trust your bank to return your money to you... why do you think your insurance firm will be able to do so? To avoid people not trusting the bank the FDIC exists.

First, to understand: there are two types of issues with banks:


Crash/Bankruptcy: The bank owes $X. The assets of the bank (including money that the bank has borrowed) are less than $X.
Bank run: The bank owes $X. The assets of the bank are more than enough to pay $X, but most of them are not liquid enough (they are mostly as loans that will be paid in the coming months or years). By some cause, people loses trusts in the bank and wants to retire all of his money, and the bank cannot pay because not all of his assets can be converted to money so quickly.


The bankruptcy will be caused by the bank taking too much risks or by mismanagement, the bank run may be completely unrelated to the actual health of the bank.

Now, if the bank goes down in a period of economic growth, maybe insurance firms can take the hit. But the fact is that banks are most likely to go down during depression times (people and business who borrowed money fill for bankruptcy and the money will not be returned). So, what happens then?

Well, your insurance company did not take your money and bury it in a hole, waiting to need it. They invested it, most probably in conservative strategy. In other words, the insurers money is in the banks.

So Bank A crashes, and the insurers go and retire money to pay the claims. Now Bank B or C, who were more or less surviving the depression, find that suddenly they have lost a lot of liquidity, and that may find trouble returning people deposits. Some people are aware of it and go to the bank to ensure that they are the first in line to get their money back... and now Bank B and/or C are under too. Guess what happens next?

Other point of the issue is that insurance fees are calculated on the basis that disasters are few and strange. To put it simply: if a hurricane strikes your town and 10% of the homes are demolished, to make it even your insurance fee would be to have 10% of the cost of rebuilding your house (I do not know how much you pay but I bet not that much). If it is not and such a disaster exists, your insurance provider may very well go under, too. That is why special measures are taken for natural disasters. A bank going under is not a natural disaster, but (unless for small banks) it usually affects so many people that its effects are similar. The ""too big to fail"" term is not a meaningless one (that said, if a bank ""too big to fail"" fails, there should be a inquiry into the reason and a punishment for mismanagement if that happened).

Add to that the typical corporate shennanigans (remember when credit agencies gave A+ qualifications to everything their customers put in the market?) Ask for private insurance, and you will get the insurance offered to you in the bank office, by an insurance firm that is so closely tied with the bank that will have not funds when something happens.

And finally, imagine this scenario: you open your mail, and read a letter from your insurance company telling you that the fee for insuring your money in Bank A has gone from 0.1% to 0.5%. What would you do?


Nothing, because you are sure that if something happens your insurance company will pay you.
Run to the bank and get your money out of there as quickly as you can, fighting the hordes of customers trying to do the same, before the increased risk materializes.


Also it is worth noting that many people do not have that much money to deposit. If you tell someone that, added to almost null interest, they will have to pay for insurance to ensure the $20K that are their life savings,  most probably many people will retire their money and store it at home.

OTOH, you cannot either go without ensuring at least partially the deposits, because that way any rumour (with base or without it) risks causing a bank run. At the appearance of even the slightest hint of recession, all people would retire their money from the bank and a total collapse would happen.

"2016-04-19 19:44:32","You ask why rather than how. I will assume that you know that each state sets its own rules (subject to the main party rules) as shown below. 

The parties enforce national rules to a certain extent, but leave many details up to the states. Before going into why I will summarize the current national rules. Otherwise some people think that the national rules are completely rigid or that it is a complete free for all at the state level.

How Political Party Convention Delegates are Chosen


  Delegates to the national conventions are selected at the state level,
  according to rules and formulas determined by each political party's
  state committee. While these rules and formulas can change from
  state-to-state and from year-to-year, there remain two methods by
  which the states choose their delegates to the national conventions:
  the caucus and the primary.


Democrats use a proportional method. Each candidate is awarded a number of delegates in proportion to their support in the state caucuses or the number of primary votes they won. However, the decision to use the primary or caucus method is left up to the state. There are also some states that use winner take all (or most) method). States also differ as to whether the proportion is calculated statewide or by district.

Democratic Detailed Delegate Allocation give the detailed national rules. Within these rules, each state may set up its own rules.

Democratic Delegate Selection and Voter Eligibility


  The rules of the Democratic National Convention call for the following
  formula to be used in determining the allocation of delegate votes to
  each jurisdiction sending a delegation to the Convention.
  
  Each jurisdiction with electoral votes is assigned a number of Base
  (delegate) votes based on an ""Allocation Factor"" multiplied by 3,200
  [Call Rule I.B.] arrived at through a calculation
  
  To summarize, half of a jurisdiction's base vote is determined by the
  number of Presidential Electors assigned to that state and half are
  computed by the number of people who voted for the Democratic
  Presidential candidate in the last three elections.


The Republican rules require that the delegates be chosen by primary, caucus, or convention. Some states (such as Colorado) use a series of conventions at the lowest level that choose the delegates to the convention  at the next highest level. This culminates in a statewide convention to choose the delegates to the national convention (though this is the only one that the popular media cover). Proportional representation can mean statewide or by individual district or a combination of methods.

Republican Delegate Allocation

Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation


  
    These rules appear to state that delegates must be elected by
    winner-take-all or proportional primaries, caucuses, and conventions.
    Direct delegate election by primary is also permitted.
  


The main reason is that the United States was set up as a federal republic in which each state is regarded as an independent political entity. Each state chooses the delegates of the state in the same way that it elects its own representative. As a result, they would refuse to allow any one outside the state to dictate the rules for delegate allocation. If the national party hierarchy attempted to enforce uniform rules, such as all states must be ""all for one"" or ""statewide proportional representation"" or ""proportional representation by congressional district"", the party would fall apart as the individual states objected to being told what to do.

As a result, the national party sets general rules and limits, and the individual states determine the rules for the following election cycle.

Kasich is dead wrong here. Rape is never the victim's fault. It is the responsibility of young men to restrain themselves, to follow the law, and to show young women basic respect. Failure to do so is wrong. And it is ridiculous to try to attach blame for a crime deliberately and maliciously committed by a criminal to the crime's victim.

"2016-04-20 18:34:38","Why does the US have military bases in friendly countries?


Logistics: The US has military bases all over the world. This, in addition to things like aircraft carriers and air patrols, allows the US to respond quickly to unexpected threats.
Show of friendship: Many allies of the US depend on its military, in whole or in part, for their defense. Keeping a contingent of personnel and resources in the allied country reinforces the commitment of the alliance.
To facilitate allied military operations: During many missions, a coalition of allied forces will participate. This may involve things like e.g. loading French soldiers and British tanks onto an American plane on a military base in Germany.
Show of power: Having lots of bases all over the world is a way of intimidating enemies. Many US bases are concentrated around countries that pose a potential threat to the US and/or its allies.


Why SE Asia in particular?


Historical reasons: SE Asia was hit hard in WWII. During the Cold War, it became one of the focal points of the conflict. Communist influence from China and Russia spread into SE Asia and the US attempted to halt and contain it (see the Vietnam War and the Korean War). The amount of military activity in this area during the 20th century necessitated the establishment of local bases.
North Korea: North Korea is considered a significant threat to the region, especially to South Korea and Japan which are two of America's closest allies in the area. Keeping troops nearby discourages the DPRK from launching direct attacks, and helps US allies feel safe.
China: The US and China have a complicated relationship. There is currently conflict between the two powers regarding claims to the South China Sea, a conflict which has been simmering for some years now. Both sides have been positioning their respective militaries back and forth trying to gain an advantage. While neither side wants a confrontation, the threat involved requires keeping troops available nearby.

"2016-04-20 21:20:35","The issues involving Iran are quite exceptional, focusing primarily on these issues gives a rather misleading picture about the NPT. So, let's start with considering what the whole point of the NPT is.

When nuclear technology was developed after WWII, it was clear that the vast majority of the countries in the World would not be able to develop this technology on their own, which would mean that they would not be able to enjoy the benefits of nuclear energy unless they would be given access to it by the few countries that had developed it. Note that at that time, the public image of nuclear image was different from what it is now, it was seen as a miracle energy source, with only a small amount of enriched uranium needed to power a giant 1000 megawatt plant.

There was one big obstacle standing in the way of realizing this nuclear utopia, and that was that the same technology could be used to produce nuclear weapons. The NPT treaty is a solution to this specific problem, it imposes restrictions on how a country can use the acquired nuclear technology. It imposes an inspections regime and transparency rules to verify that a country is sticking to the rules. These transparency rules mean that the member state cannot pursue any nuclear weapons related activities.

However, at heart, the NPT is not a restrictive treat that can prevent countries from produce nuclear weapons on their own. One can see that most clearly from article ten of the NPT that allows countries to leave the NPT after giving a 3 months notice. So, signing the NPT is not an irreversible act that would irreversibly revoke a countries sovereign right to develop nuclear weapons, it's just that a country is barred from using whatever it gets by virtue of being part from the NPT, to pursue a weapons program.

But for transparency purposes, this means that the country cannot pursue a nuclear weapons program as long as it is part of the NPT even if it were able to keep weapons related activities separate from what it would get from its NPT membership. In case of India, a special arrangement was made to allow the US to sell civilian nuclear technology to India. In this case India had to implement certain measures to keep its weapons related activities separate from its civilian infrastructure.

Since in practice, the only realistic way things could spiral out of control leading to a World where we would have wars breaking out fought with nuclear weapons, would be due nuclear technology spreading, and not due to countries developing nuclear technology on their own. Therefore the NPT is a very important treaty to make sure this does not happen and to get to  nuclear disarmament. To achieve the latter aim, the NPT asks the declared nuclear power to engage in negotiations to reduce their nuclear stockpiles. The treaty has been updated several times to make it stronger, e.g. the Additional Protocol has been added to strengthen the transparency about nuclear activities of member states.

Now, as I mentioned at the start, Iran's case is exceptional, it has little to do with how the NPT is supposed to work. It's a good example of how it is not supposed to work and how things can spiral out of control due to distrust. Basically the problem started  back in the 1980s when the US was worried that Iran's access to nuclear technology via the NPT could be abused for a weapons program even if Iran were never to violate any rules. So, the scenario that the US feared was that Iran simply sticks to all the rules, Iranian scientists and engineers get familiar with nuclear technology and then Iran can later decide to leave the NPT by invoking Article ten during some conflict. Obviously the Iran-Iraq war going on at that time was such a conflict that led to the suspicions that Iran would likely be motivated to pursue nuclear weapons.

This thinking led to the US to impose diplomatic pressure on countries involved in Iran's nuclear program, leading to delays in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear powerplant:


  According to Moscow Defense Brief, until 2005 Washington exerted considerable diplomatic pressure on Russia to stop the project, as the US administrations viewed it as evidence of Russia's indirect support for the alleged Iranian nuclear arms program. The United States also tried to persuade other countries to ban their companies from taking part. For example, Ukraine's Turboatom was to supply a turbine, but cancelled the deal after the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to Kiev on 6 March 1998. The United States lifted its opposition to the project in 2005, partly due to the deal signed by Moscow and Tehran, under which spent fuel from the plant would be sent back to Russia.


This attitude likely led to Iran to make the decision to pursue an enrichment program in the late 1990s. Obviously if you can hardly get access to nuclear technology to get the Bushehr reactor finished, getting fuel for it would probably be impossible. And in the 1990s, Iran could not know that in the 2000s Putin would be Russia's leader who would steer Russia a bit clear from Western pressure. For all Iran could know in the 1990s, Russia was well on its way to become more integrated with the West, so it would likely become more under pressure from the US to stop being involved in its nuclear program.

Now, the way Iran decided to get the nuclear technology needed for enrichment violated some aspects of the transparency rules, but there were no breaches of the safeguard agreements. Inspections performed later by the IAEA never found evidence of activities related to a weapons program. Also Iran did not violate any rules for having build the Natanz enrichment facility and not a priori notified the IAEA about it, as under the rules, Iran was only supposed to notify the IAEA 6 month's before it would become operational.

But, obviously, the US plan to prevent Iran from operating any large nuclear powerplants lay in tatters after it was found out that Iran had constructed an enrichment facility. Also it was fuel to the US' original suspicion that Iran's access to nuclear technology was actually a problem regardless of whether or not this was done by ""by the book"". Rather than recognize that its efforts to restrict Iran from having access to nuclear technology had backfired, the US wanted to impose new restrictions. But the only way forward was to get international support for the US position.

This was the start of a decade long back and forth fight involving Iran's rights and international obligations that has nothing whatsoever to do with the NPT. It's far more about how the US despite being a superpower failed to get its way. It has been a long retreat from its original aim to prevent Iran from operating nuclear powerplants to prevent it from having the technology to enrich uranium, to prevent it from actually operating centrifuges to prevent it from operating an industrial scale enrichment program to where we are today, which is basically what Iran proposed back in 2003, i.e. a system that ensures Iran's right to all technology including industrial scale enrichment while making sure that Iran does not produce nuclear weapons.

So, you cannot consider the whole brouhaha between Iran and the West in terms of just the NPT, the NPT was just invoked to fight out a conflict that would also have existed had Iran never signed the NPT. Note that the US applied pressure on the IAEA to refer Iran to the UNSC, so that the UNSC could impose restrictions on Iran's nuclear program that went beyond Iran's obligations under the NPT. The IAEA's role from that point onward was changed, it had to check if Iran was sticking to the UNSC demands. Clearly an Iran outside of the NPT would only have meant that the IAEA route not been available to the US. But nothing would then have stopped the US from raising Iran directly at the UNSC. The UNSC would have been free to impose restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities regardless of its NPT membership.

During the last decade the fundamental issue, as far as the West was concerned, was Iran's refusal to stop enriching uranium. But Iran never signed any agreement that would demand that it do so. Therefore it was Iran not sticking to a hypothetical agreement that it actually did not sign, not the NPT, that was the core issue.

  The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.


I would guess that these conventions are large gatherings, but I was wondering several things about them:


Who participates in these conventions?
How are conventions for proposing amendments different from those meant to ratify amendments?
How is it decided whether an amendment is ratified at the convention.  (majority? supermajority?)
How are conventions conducted?

"2016-04-21 13:01:25","@origimbo That's a good point, and I will accept that if it is true.  However, I would like to know the answer to my question if it exists.","7966"
"2016-04-21 14:24:08","There are some grey areas because there haven't ever been conventions for amendments. The first part is pretty straightforward, if two thirds of state legislatures call for a convention then Congress is responsible for setting up a place and time for the convention. From that point presumably each state could individually decide to attend and select a delegation to represent them. Then it would be up to the members at the convention to create the rules they want to follow to determine which amendments are proposed.

Convention for ratifying would be different, each state would have their own convention where the appointed members would decide whether or not to ratify a proposed amendment. It would be up to congress to declare that conventions are required to ratify a proposed amendment.

Conventions are generally allowed to create their own rules, and the end result would be something similar to a session in congress or any other legislature. Conventions can be extremely open ended, the constitutional convention was supposed to be a convention to amend the articles of confederation, however they ended up proposing an entirely new government.

The Vermont senator will participate in a conference on social, economic and environmental issues April 15, alongside Bolivian President Evo Morales, Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa and others, his campaign and the Vatican said.""

And this statement was in ABC news: ""The trip was organized and paid for by Sanders’ campaign.""

Isn't there a clear violation of the use of campaign funds here? I know there is probably a sort of gray area as to whether the conference is considered campaigning, but doesn't his campaign stating that it was ""time off the campaign trail"" point to a violation?

A balanced budget convention proposal had passed in 32 of 34 states needed by 1983, for example.  But my point was that it's a significant step to take in the first place, and it usually results in Congress passing its own version of an amendment or law before the needed total is actually reached.  I don't think most people want a total rewrite, and any single-issue call can be short-circuted by Congress.","2130"

First, even if he wasn't campaigning in Rome, he was campaigning where he was before and after the trip.  So he could argue that the travel was campaign related from that alone.  

Second, he may well have received a campaign benefit from going to the Vatican.  It certainly got him a lot of ""free"" media before, during, and after the trip.  

Third, Donald Trump pays his own company for his travel with campaign funds, which is directly against the rules.  Yet no one is trying to prosecute him.  It's difficult to prosecute people for campaign finance violations.  

Fourth, it is far more likely that the FEC would simply make Sanders pay his campaign back if they did find wrongdoing.  They haven't recommended prosecution since 2008.  

It would be trivial to argue that his campaign benefited from his trip even if he was not on the ""campaign trail"".  I doubt that it will receive serious consideration.  It seems more like a bad choice of words (possibly by the reporter; note that it wasn't quoted) than a serious campaign violation.  

Although it is interesting to see how he has been treated versus Marlin Stutzman.  Sanders could easily justify his campaign paying for his own travel and possibly his spouse's, but what about that of the other eight members of his family?

"2016-04-22 14:44:07","I see no real 100% democracy even in 2016 today. Every countries running by any particular system is imperfect and yet we will only enlarge the cons of each other and cover the logical reasoning and methods available that today is easily implementable with out level of technology. All for the gains of 1%. The focus on political power and economy using legislation in laws are forever one step behind to ensure the advantage of minority over the majority.  

The China issue is not about democracy but how much can they had improved till today in such a short time and their current system is proven to be right for this country. Yes. freedom, media control, human rights issue, corruption, injustice are still prevailing but until the rest of the world can stop trading with them or willing to send army in to take over then its pointless to keep talking but rather try and change them faster for the better. 

Democracy had started on a stage of one people one vote in the west and let the majority of people decide. We had set legal age limit on when you can vote through logical reasoning but yet failed to move to next stage when our evolution required a more responsive, rational democratic system. It will need to take into considerations of factors like age ( why a first time voter young man had same voting right as a 70 grandfather contributing.), qualification(professional of all fields can have their own associations or NGOs globally and yet experts view are so minimized and influenced so great greatly by political parties or corporations. We are fast to create profits with bad products and services but take how long to stop or control them (tobacco, bacon and ham and now wifi) Always selling to the poorly informed common people for our convenience of quick profit. 

The format of using western developed countries as a model that the are the current best should not be defined 10/10 but rather what else in term of possibility of IT we use to enhance as the correct perfect score. Then this will also bring the developing nations to accelerate faster for improvements. Eg laws should be enforced using all available statistic on a dashboard to put into stricter punishment when certain crime reach certain level and decrease accordingly if necessary(low possibility again as our population increase worldwide only increase crime rate with more criminals of all kinds).eg Even traffic fines should be based on % of income reported or assets instead of fixed amount that is so unfair to the poor and won't hinder the rich behaviour. Might as well give license for speeding outright.

The main cons of democracy is that 1. as long majority of people allowed, there is few mechanism to stop our current system from implementing new rules that are totally wrong morally, logically or rationally. There need to be same counter force to prevent wrong judgement. Some examples are:If majority vote you are not the child of yr biological parent. technically its possible. If majority agree justin can have 100 wifes or taylor swift can drive over any speed limit, why not? The scale of moral and populism must be managed evenly. 2. the term of 2-5 year of any election is too long to wait for next better option and too hard to bring them any elected ones. Look at the poll figures for any person in elected position for any countries in this century and you realized how hard is it to name one person who exit on non-popularity issue. So what incentive is there to be good man all the way when we can have restrictive terms on reasonable doubts to rotate officers but public can't even rate them properly to bring them down fast enough when required based on few bad decisions. We can have millions of trade daily trading in miliiseconds and yet don't even have people based KPIs rating on all government servants like the rating on bank clerk or Mac cashier with a smiley or grumpy face? Even S &amp; P or Moody standards are what we supposed to be paid by govt and yet till the day banks crushes the rating is still good as even. 

The fault lines of democracy are so clear cut and yet logical reasoning on simple problems that explode into headlines will take years to solve. IT will need be used intensively to help people manage the government errors that results in huge monetary and environmental losses to the people. We are still living in the world where in any countries there is no index to know exactly how many people are there alive, gonna be dead or given birth soon. People are missing in Flight like MH370 and Harry porter name can even come out in the Panama Paper. These solutions won't need scientist to come out with and preventive step can easily be written and modified by experts, but never instant to implement. Justice will never come fast enough and might even take forever while crime take only seconds to commit. Protest and riots are too slow or even easily suppress to make real impact. The level of colluding by govts on a level never will be open to public unless wikileak happen is what we can wish for now. Therefore any fight of democracy, human rights,justice, transparency, climate, animal rights etc are all only tools to bring either left, right or center party in any government down but they all have certain level constraints here or there to individuals. The participation rate of any voting that is so hard to reach the 2/3 or 3/4 level is indications of how dishearten people are really. Life goes on when good and bad  event is still 50/50 in any country.The chance any of us get kill in school or by police in US or by China government is the same. I'm lucky to be born in one of those country singapore that neither will EVER happen. Privilege for 5m and rich one who can migrate here. Case of so successful on international scale and yet silence on global issues to avoid earning the irks of trading partners. Moral obligations that can be proven logically and with available statistics must be integrated into IT for the only solutions to solve all global issues with results in sight.

"2016-04-22 23:20:29","Well sure, after the crisis, US/Cuba relations were nearly irreparably damaged, causing an extension and expansion of sanctions and embargoes against Cuba (1). You might say, however, that it was just one step of many that have worked against the Cuban economy and culminated with the dissolution of the Soviet Union (5). 

Cuba had established ties with the Soviet Union in '59 (2) which caused tensions and hostilities before and leading up to the missile crisis. This was also the first year that Fidel Castro came into power via the Cuban Revolution(3), and the Soviet Union was reportedly surprised to find that they could have an ally so close to the US (2).

The Soviet Union took pride in the defense and support of Cuba (2):


  The defense of Cuba became a matter of prestige for the Soviet Union, and Khruschev believed that the U.S. would block all access to the island whether by sea or air. Even in the 1980s the Soviet aid wasn't very important, but rather a regular trade with Cuba of more than $8.5 billion in 1989 was reached. But already in 1990 the trade was reduced to $4.5 billion.[5]


The Soviets tried to help (2):


  Washington's increasing economic embargo led Cuba to hurriedly seek new markets to avert economic disaster. Castro asked for help from the Soviets and in response Khrushchev approved the temporary purchase of Cuban sugar in exchange for Soviet fuel. This deal was to play a part in sustaining the Cuban economy for many years to come.


The ""Special Period"" (4):


  The dissolution of the Soviet Union hit the Cuban economy severely. The country lost approximately 80% of its imports, 80% of its exports and its Gross Domestic Product dropped by 34%. Food and medicine imports stopped or severely slowed. The largest immediate impact was the loss of nearly all of the petroleum imports from the USSR;[2] Cuba's oil imports dropped to 10% of pre-1990 amounts.[3] Before this, Cuba had been re-exporting any Soviet petroleum it did not consume to other nations for profit, meaning that petroleum had been Cuba's second largest export product before 1990.


A blogger (7) wrote:


  If you want to take a step back into automotive time, then you need to go to Cuba. That’s a rule in the automotive industry. Havana itself is beautiful, with its brightly colored—if slightly dusty—buildings and milling streets, but there is nothing quite as beautiful as seeing a line of classic cars sitting at an intersection like it’s no big deal.


Why are there so  many old American cars in Cuba? (6):


  Until the 1960 embargo, most new vehicles came to Cuba from the United States until the 1960 United States embargo against Cuba ended both importation of cars and their parts. As many as 60,000 American vehicles are in use,[10] nearly all in private hands. Of Cuba's vintage American cars, many have been modified with newer engines, disc brakes and other parts, often scavenged from Soviet cars, and most bear the marks of decades of use.[11] Pre-1960 vehicles remain the property of their original owners and descendants, and can be sold to other Cubans providing the proper traspaso certificate is in place. Such transactions can be difficult, but in 2010, reforms were expected to legalize the sale between Cuban citizens of all cars.[12]

Introduction

1.The project will look at 3 components: People, Government, Business employed/self-employed. It can be created under a single platform which is big enough or on different ones if the features face restrictions.  The aim is not to create a new technology but to duplicate the best/ available ones which are free, licensed or purchased at low cost to be fused into the whole system. Focus on 100% (as definable) transparency, accountability and build on a credible reputation in which the whole system of operation is verifiable and certified based on which ever highest standard eg ISOs available and improve on it. We are looking to solve the main issues in income inequality, public safety, climate and sustainable environment, crime rates, unemployment, resource management etc.

2.Everything in this world can be faked and misuse for crimes. Protection of individual privacy is one of the greatest excuse that had been crested to keep everyone isolated and even more prone to harm. The level of sophistication in the crimes that can be imagined are so creative that there is no regulations that are enticed into laws fast enough to keep pace. 100% freedom and human rights are impossible and we can gauge and monitor all aspect of the society using facts and statistics. Then proceed to create all scenarios of feasible, possible solutions as options that can gain traction for the different environment to which people can choose to implement, on personal, work or government issues. All revolutions, riots and protest are started by most people of logical and rational reasoning ability to address the unjust and unfair treatment or environment they are in. Therefore we should use every scientific and morally right means to justify every action in a democratic way as possible. 

3.The main features of google docs, watapps/wechat, facebook, survey monkey, ERPs,CRMs, POS, Fedex parcel tracking, GPS, dashboard, KPIs, MMORPG game format(eg second life), E-wallets, Singpass system (form of secured login method), biometric, online banking, smartphone app module, cloud database, IOTs, online camera monitoring, youtube, alibaba etc are what I look to create on this single platform or design separately but linkable. Exclude all high definition graphic or visual aspect as they are not required. The common database will also act as alternate channel to obtain national statistic where in the today world that current government is unable to provide accurately. For all the available technology, OS, software that already exist, the initial stage will focus on identifying them in all areas and setup the database that can manage all the data which will be used to explore the advantages. In the design of the platform, we just need to focus on being the 2nd best as much as possible while the actual product that is already out there could still be used as a supplement if required. Feasible new features better than the actual is bonus.

4.The initial founders or core members will have to contribute on a goodwill voluntary basis due to fact that this project will need to look at the bigger picture of giving earth management a better option that till today all problems and crisis that existed are going to be what we want to prevent in the future. The aspect of crisis management will be deeply shaped into our system that we will go forward as a whole that can influence the decisions making already being in place in real world by countries or governing bodies, directly. Once funding stabilized then we look at providing stable income for all involved in a merit based system according to measured contribution against market rate.

5.Never create what you can’t control is the principal and the approach that our audience will be all living 7B people currently on Earth. Target participation will be half the population of each country where the registration reach will start of the actual system regardless of level of completion.  The initial target will be half the population in any country and based on our main concept of transparency, accountability, credibility set always a level higher than current official standards anywhere. Marketing will be based on giving free credit like the gaming industry, setting a scale over a person lifetime to define different stages and level to create and maintain interest. Initial funding will be from the charity community where we will have online instant figure to provide to the public on the income and expense where no one had done before. An online website where we not only show accounts, but also every actual details in operations.      

6.Due to the scale of the project, different stages for different country will be set 1-10 and resources (human, fund) will set assigned by priority ranking. Any qualified person can come into this project at different part/stage and contribute accordingly (full time, part time, volunteer basis) Currently I will only list the 1st stage as I can only do that much alone without any fund available to put the project onto the implementation stage. But I believe it’s still possible to start off with current technology and connectivity of internet to the mass public if done correctly. My ideal currently is to spread this concept/vehicle of my ideology as wide as possible for people to either start off on their own or partner/sponsor me. I believe me as the driver will be the main difference to the extent this goal can be reach and I don’t mind other to reach the destination before me for the better of mankind. Therefore open source, crowdsourcing, transparency and accountability is my main emphasis. The existence of all different charities and NGOs but with similar purpose show there is always a niche I can create differently.

Stage 1:
-   Get professional editor to format my write up into proper format. 
-   Identify available platform, software- 1 year +
-   Recruit volunteers and like-minded people to form a team of 100s of all fields to brainstorm and improvise
-   Create website to obtain donations, choose a forum to create an interactive open source community that work specific for this project
-   Source of funding is open as long it does not affect the overall direction of the project.

"2016-04-23 05:51:48","It also matters where the refugee is.  If someone is in Syria, then they can easily be fleeing persecution by moving into Turkey or Jordan.  But once in Turkey, they would have to be fleeing *Turkish* persecution to move into Greece as refugees.  That's why they hop on boats.  Because once in Greece, it's hard to move them out.","4666"

"2016-04-23 16:46:06","There's a lot more 'celebrity-->politician' examples. Sonny Bono, Clint Eastwood and Al Franken are some that popped into mind.","1530"
"2016-04-23 17:41:06","@blip  But none of those (with the possible exception of Franken) were ""successfully elected to the highest state or federal offices available without holding a more junior elected position first"".  Eastwood only ever held a junior position.  Bono held a junior position (same one as Eastwood) and then a somewhat higher position.  Franken skipped straight to Senator, but is that a junior or a senior position?  He's one of a hundred, a relatively privileged hundred, but he's still not alone.","4666"
"2016-04-23 17:52:22","@DrunkCynic by refulgent I mean the UNHCR definition of ""No Contracting State shall expel or return (""refouler"") a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.""","7976"
"2016-04-23 18:00:01","@Winple-Yes, that is the concept of refoulment; the question is focused on justifying the rejection of refugees via border enforcement. While the signing nations may be required to bring in refugees, acting against that requirement isn't refoulment.","6738"
"2016-04-23 18:10:04","So essentially they are allowed to refuse refugees","7976"
"2016-04-23 18:25:46","@PointlessSpike. Appearntly you need to study more and do more homework on the religion subject    you're talking about. You seem to lack massive part of information.","7980"
"2016-04-23 19:50:24","How does this work? By instructing immigration officers, border-guards, military, police or other government branches to prevent refugees from crossing the border.

Of course there are international treaties which would theoretically outlaw this practice, but international treaties are only effective when other states are willing to enforce them. When they do not feel that it is politically wise to get involved (or even in their interest to not get involved, for example because the refugees would move on straight to them when allowed to enter the European Union), they won't.

Note that most of the EU border states haven't officially closed their borders to refugees. They rather insist on refugees passing the border in an ordered and controlled manner where each refugee is registered properly. This of course takes its time because the number of refugees which can be processed that way per day is limited.

"2016-04-23 20:05:08","The European Pirate Party got no votes - the national parties did. The only ""successful"" one would be the German Pirate Party, specifically 424,510 (1.45%). They got one MEP (Julia Reda). EU Parliament members are voted separately for each state.

A few other national pirate parties also participated as can be seen here. You can find a table of votes and the relevant percentages.

"2016-04-23 21:07:18","You don't ask about any specific politician, but you should be aware that opposition to joining the European Union is not new.  The don't even use the European Union currency.  

In general, the main advantage of Brexit is increased sovereignty.  One of the biggest specific problems recently is that the European Union's position on refugees.  Some in the United Kingdom (UK) would prefer to set their own policy rather than follow the more accepting position of the European Union (EU) as a whole.  They are also concerned about migration within the EU, a position which came to a head during the last recession.  

Another issue is the Greece bailout.  Many feel like they're being called to pay for Greece's profligacy.  This is not unique to the UK, but as they are already only half in the EU, it's easier for them to express it in a separatist movement.

But I will try and mention one or two things of which you and the OP may not be aware.  First, in the 1975 Referendum on whether we should join the EU, 67.2% of those voting said Yes. Since then there have always been rumblings of opposition. There are reasons why this has grown in recent years, but I cannot deal with that in just a few words. – WS2 40 mins ago","6837"

The others were: •Bulgaria,•Croatia.•Czech Republic.•Denmark.•Hungary.•Poland.•Romania•Sweden. Most of those were part of the former Soviet Bloc, and have far less prosperous economies than the western countries. However Sweden and Denmark have strong economies - but like Britain choose not to join. An overwhelming majority of the British population, whatever they feel about our being in the EU, say they are glad we stayed out of the Euro.","6837"
"2016-04-23 23:57:58","The refugee crisis arising out of the breakdown of Syria has placed monumental pressure on some EU countries, esp. Greece, Italy and the Balkans. But that has little to do with Britain. Only a tiny proportion of Syrian refugees are stuck in a camp in France attempting to gain access to Britain. But rising levels of immigration, partly due to the principal of ""free movement"" within the EU is just one of the important issues. **For a succinct idiot's guide to what the Referendum is all about, try [this BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887)**","6837"
