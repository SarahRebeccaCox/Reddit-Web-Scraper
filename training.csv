Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

- What the hell is with Bernie's taxes? There is tons and tons of precedent for candidates releasing all of their taxes. Why is he being so shady about it?

His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders.

That does not seem unfair.  Why should Wyoming outweigh Florida?

This is the only evidence they give that the Democratic primaries are rigged.

The main evidence I have seen boils down to this:  ""Bernie is the candidate of the people.  If it were not rigged, he would be winning.""  The idea that most people really prefer Clinton seems to not occur to Sanders supporters.  And they think that people who prefer Clinton are stupid, low information voters who just have not heard the Truth about Sanders.

But ignoring that, I really found this article impactful. Everything I read about Hillary doing her job in government just impresses me. And yeah, she's a truly awful campaigner, but I can't say I care very much.

The one thing that really struck me in here is the line about how when she was campaigning in 2008, she'd go out for speeches and people would hold up signs saying ""Beat the Bitch"". I mean...what the fuck. Was I unaware of this in 2008? Did I just not care?

Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source]( And source [for votes... another politifact]( titled **""Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases?""**, rated **mostly true**       
Again. It's Vermont, I doubt Sanders would have made it to the Senate if he voted against the aforementioned stuff.

Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands.

>The reality is that Clinton's plan would barely scratch the surface of the issue. Her proposals are aimed at Citizens United, but as we established, that's a small piece to a much larger problem. If the Democratic front-runner got her way, corporations would have to disclose their political donations. However, the heart of the matter is far more complex. Her plan doesn't change that money is speech, nor does it involve tightening the rules of what constitutes ""social welfare."" It does not do anything towards regulating 501c4 nonprofits, which would still be able to hide their donors. ""Issue advocacy"" would still be largely unchecked. Like in the example I gave above, wealthy individuals like the Koch Brothers, who are corporate interests, would still be able to run political ""issue"" ads through nonprofits with benign names, hiding their identities while pushing a corporate agenda. These individuals would not have to disclose their spending because they are not corporations, nor are they necessarily spending on politics.","Reddit",118,0.664705882352941,10,17,1.57647058823529,1061,854,12.9176470588235,56.2105882352942,10.7308235294118,11.9963755966353,10,10,9.64235294117647,9.94117647058823,9.24121204171834,11.2,8,10,12.5161,5,166,0.0180722891566265,0.333333333333333,-0.333333333333333,0.444444444444444,0.333333333333333,0.444444444444444,0.111111111111111,0.444444444444444,0.444444444444444,0.111111111111111,0.222222222222222,0.444444444444444,0.222222222222222,0.666666666666667

"17542",1460055204,"to provide evidence about the populations attitude towards LGBT rights:


  Although the Constitutional and legal system in South Africa
  theoretically ensure equality, social acceptance is generally lacking,
  especially outside of urban areas in the eastern half of the country.
  A 2008 survey found that 84% of South Africans said homosexual sexual
  behavior is always wrong, compared to 8% who said that it is not wrong
  at all.[38] In a 2013 survey, 61% said society should not accept
  homosexuality.[39]


Additionally:


  ""Homosexuality is a taboo to us,"" he says. ""I'll go back to African
  traditions, there's no word for that in our language.""
  
  I ask what would happen if one of his daughters told him she was a
  lesbian.
  
  ""I might kill her myself. That thing is unnatural, it's awkward, so I
  cannot accept something that is awkward in my house.
  
  ""If someone said choose between keeping this child or killing it, I
  would kill it.""


That is a very strong contrast to the strong laws in favor for LGBT rights. Hence my question:

Why had the south African government implemented those rights, which are the exact opposition to the majority of the south African population? Don't get me wrong, I love LGBT rights, but i don't understand this in terms of democracy: If the population is against LGBT rights, but the government implements exactly that, democracy has failed. 

Therefore, it makes no sense at all to implement that for the government (e.g. to have an appearance of a modern state), because they won't be elected again.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

> Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

> The saga continues.

> > He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

> > He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

She's a liar, a dirty dealer, a flip-flopper, probably a criminal, and one of the least progressive ""progressives"" that have ever existed, but she's still doing pretty fucking well in the polls.","Reddit",101,0.740458015267176,7,18.7142857142857,1.51908396946565,773,611,13.5925845147219,59.3254961832061,9.89515812431843,10.0425426191603,10,10,9.63376226826609,9.69465648854962,9.34268239242426,12.3571428571429,6,9,13.0238667986669,5,125,0.024,-2.85714285714286,-0.428571428571429,0,0.285714285714286,0.142857142857143,0.571428571428571,0.285714285714286,0.285714285714286,0,0,0.285714285714286,0.714285714285714,0.714285714285714

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.  




( 

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Does ""partly"" mean the linkage between the trade deal and the military bidding process was inferred?

And what do they do? They actually create an entire campaign against Sanders' supporters, calling them sexists misogynists, branding them with a condescending name. Generalizing them as nothing but young, dumb people who haven't done their research. And even going as far as shaming women who support Bernie Sanders.

And I'm not even talking about small anecdotes, all of these things were committed MULTIPLE times by MULTIPLE people on the Hillary side. This was obviously coordinated strategy.

And why did they do this? Because they didn't enough bad stuff to find on Bernie Sanders.

> His first accusation – that Verizon doesn't pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we've paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that's a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who's counting. We've laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see ""Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight"" at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified ""given year"" – but that doesn't make his contention any less false.

and

>Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn't use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders's home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston's Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We're making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

> Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, ""so messed up"". 

How nuanced.

I was confused for awhile until I started dealing with venders directly, and realized that a large portion of these guys were ex-military. A large percentage of the guys I dealt with were in charge of purchasing while they were in, then by some crazy coincidence, after making terrible deals that cost taxpayers millions they got cushy jobs at the same venders they made the orders with. 

This made it especially disgusting for me when the military had their budget reduced, and their immediate reaction was to cut tuition assistance for servicemen. Instead of doing anything to stop these terrible deals that cost us millions for the exact same product, they instead held our military members hostage, stopping them from attending college that gave us better service members while they were in, and gave them better capabilities when they got out so they wouldn't have to rely on government assistance.

Guess what happens go the trust fund when people stop contributing to it?  It dries up, and the money that used to be there is now invested in the private sector.  (And if you invested poorly, enjoy eating cat food in your golden years.)

Why does Politifact seem so eager to go through the tortured exercise of calling this ""Mostly False""?

Let's not forget that quite recently, a Republican President campaigned on the promise of privatizing Social Security.  It was a big point of contrast with his opponent, who was promising to ""put Social Security in a lockbox"".","Reddit",101,0.702898550724638,9,15.3333333333333,1.52173913043478,797,625,11.0608695652174,62.5325362318841,7.5681884057971,8.89935372493913,89,89,8.34652173913044,9.89130434782609,8.33333333333333,8.55555555555556,5,8,10.9805187677557,5,135,0.0222222222222222,0,0,0.555555555555556,0.333333333333333,0.666666666666667,0.111111111111111,0.111111111111111,0.666666666666667,0,0.444444444444444,0.888888888888889,0.333333333333333,0.888888888888889

Ok, Ill bite. I'm sure Verizon pays at least some taxes if McAdam's is going to say that.

>A 2014 report from Citizens for Tax Justice found that Verizon was among dozens of companies that, from 2008-2012, paid no federal corporate income tax—a fact that led Sanders to put the company on his list of America's Top 10 Corporate Tax Avoiders.

We know a grand jury has been convened (because they gave Bryan Pagliano immunity). So that means they intend to bring charges against *somebody* and they have enough to convict *somebody*.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

Also, the fact that they're moving SO carefully and SO slowly, and the business with extraditing Guccifer, etc, it seems to me that they would not go to such painstaking lengths and seemingly be walking on eggshells if they were not going after Hillary but merely one of her aides.

The impressive stats Sanders has, in real life, are:

- total  of contributors
- total  of contributors whose total donations per quarter are below $200
- average per-quarter donation
- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

This is also why Hillary pushes for $1 donations, it's specifically so she can cite that one garbage stat.","Reddit",134,0.581081081081081,10,22.2,1.57657657657658,1287,1003,14.2854054054054,50.9236216216216,10.9498648648649,9.43171138491531,13,10,11.6716036036036,10.6081081081081,10.0149887668434,14.2,7,10,13.1874277437157,5,201,0.0398009950248756,0.444444444444444,-0.111111111111111,-0.111111111111111,0.444444444444444,0.333333333333333,0.444444444444444,0.333333333333333,0.333333333333333,0.222222222222222,0.111111111111111,0.888888888888889,1,0.888888888888889

  Does he have a more specific basis for this event to be a greater
  catastrophe than everything else from that turbulent century?


I don't see that Putin claims to make a comparison. On the world level it was a major event. For the Russians, it was the event.

What I remember most strongly of the time when the Berlin Wall fell, and consequently the collapse of Russia, was the West's lack of aid when it was asked for. Russia was in dire straights, and collectively, on a political basis, we didn't help them. That social upheaval could have been mitigated. 

My understanding is that Putin has been hard pressed to take the country back from organised crime groups. I agree with Putin's statement, but I also say he stopped short in pointing out how the west failed Russia.

Now, reading between the lines, I see Putin's statement as a possible precursor to justify some action Russia may take against the world. The Nazi's had a similar claim against the French after the first world war before rolling over France in a blitzkrieg.

If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

The new banks are sold on public exchanges with proceeds going to the FDIC, shares issued to employees, and lastly to the former owners/creditors of the banks.

Typically, members of the U.S. government (and certainly members of the State Department) refer publicly to the land some refer to* as Palestine as ""occupied territories"" and not ""Palestine."" This phrasing represents the official U.S. policy on the issue. (Short read:  Those who refer to the area publicly as ""Palestine"" do not represent the official current U.S. stance.

That said, the past three U.S. presidents (Clinton, Bush, and currently President Obama) have all publicly supported the push for a Palestinian statehood, and they each have referred to the current area that one would consider to be Palestine as the ""occupied territories."" (Short read: 

*Trying to be as neutral as possible here with my language!

On the show, the Jordan Valley is referred to once as ""Israeli-occupied"". I am assuming they use ""Palestine"" as shorthand for the region, not to indicate that a state of Palestine exists in this universe.

I love his position on 99% of the issues, BUT from all the stories I read about and looking at his voting record and his poor record in getting bills passed (2 post offices renamed and a veterans bill), it seems that Bernie will not work with people who are not 100% in alignment with his way of thinking.  We are still dealing with Republicans deciding not to work with Democrats because they lost the election.  I really do not feel energized to see a candidate who only became a Democrat, so he could get the democrat money to run for President and who will not only be unable to work with Republicans but also unwilling to work with many democrats.   

I also do not see a problem with the word establishment and will be more than happy when this election is over and the word is retired.

"17818",1460889482,"From what I understand, Hillary Clinton and her supporters demanded that Bernie Sanders release his tax return, suggesting that he was refusing to do so and was hiding something, even though the demand was made before April 15th and the tax return may not have even been written yet. Bernie promptly complied with the demand and it apparently contained nothing interesting after all.

This seems to just make Hillary Clinton look bad as it is an opportunity to contrast Bernie's (relatively) mundane Senator's salary and Social Security benefit to her great wealth, and his apparent transparency with her steadfast refusal to release her Wall Street speech transcripts, which Bernie and his supporters have been demanding for months, and the seeming motivation for the tax return demand.

Was this strategy of attack successful and I'm just not aware of it? What did they believe they would find in the Sanders tax return? Why did they think this was a good strategy to attack Bernie?

>Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.

>Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new ""return-free"" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like. Warren isn't the first person to propose this. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) both have similar bills this Congress.

"3899",1460641299,"Outsourced i can understand, and get behind. Automated however, will be difficult to stop and hard to justify against. 

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.  

This is all theoretical of course, but its one scenario keep imaging with this situation.","Reddit",168,0.579136690647482,12,23.1666666666667,1.44964028776978,1546,1220,13.8709832134293,60.6812649880096,10.8231175059952,8.72571276198273,10,89,10.5507553956835,9.26258992805755,10.0829889748361,14.25,7,9,12.4579756021291,5,276,0.0181159420289855,-0.583333333333333,0.166666666666667,0.5,0.25,0.333333333333333,0.0833333333333333,0.333333333333333,0.25,0.25,0.333333333333333,0.5,0.75,1.25

"2929",1460579653,"[Here's the interview the article is discussing.](

> HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](

> Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

> However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

> If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There's no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

"17764",1460700036,"There are some elected officials who choose not to use a holy book.

Notably, John Quincy Adams recounted that he had used a volume of constitutional law, with the implication that he was swearing on the principles of constitutionalism itself. Franklin Pierce did not swear an oath at all, exercising the nuance of a constitutionally-mandated option to merely affirm the oath. 

That this distinction was honored is, itself, important, because there actually is a difference. By definition, swearing is a divine invocation. This is a point of some religious significance to sects such as the Anabaptists, who foreswear the taking of oaths in compliance with the Sermon on the Mount. Keep in mind that the reason some of these sects put down roots in the New World in the first place was to escape religious disenfranchisement. So, owing to the same impulse as the First Amendment, Article II of the constitution recognizes that is not necessary to swear an oath, because it would be a point of religious qualification. Contrariwise, you might look to the example of Charles Bradlaugh, an English parliamentarian-elect who was found incapable of swearing an oath (and thus, qualifying for his office) because he didn't believe in the god that he was required to swear it to!

What I'm getting at, here, is that all of these people who have sworn oaths on the bible have done entirely so because it was their personal choice, not because any of it (even the swearing itself) is mandatory. In theory, anyway. Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon were both Quakers, which would ostensibly direct them to affirm. Nonetheless, they both conformed to convention and chose to swear. Could this indicate a de-facto religious pressure on the office of President? Well, yeah, of course, but it's also possible that neither of those men placed much importance by the nuance. Times change. 

Either way, if one does make the choice to swear in, it is only natural to substantiate it upon a holy text.

We may have Washington to blame.

For some of the prominence of such conventions, that is. You see, the actual content of the President's inaugural oath is constitutionally mandated:


  Before he enters the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""


Wait, is something missing? As related by Washington Irvine, our first President apparently thought so. After he took the oath, he kissed the bible he'd sworn on and intoned ""so help me god!"" Concluding with such words remains a tradition to this day, though it is of course completely extraneous to that which is directed by law.

* terrorists and criminals will always have their own encryption, like PGP.   Or use foreign services.  This will affect only ordinary citizens.

* This bill will hurt US industry, and force anybody who incorporates security to move offshore.

"828",1460690407,"Politicians should be held to a high level of scrutiny, but journalists have a responsibility to do their homework. At best this article is sloppy reporting perpetuating a trope of HRC that is in my opinion unfair. 

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.   

NPR link is to a 4 minute interview with Professor Goldin explaining this concept.

If you have a home loan and you miss a $1000 payment are you in debt $1000 or in debt for whatever the value of the house is?

"531",1460682897,"Barring a miracle or an indictment, Clinton's going to get the nomination. I have to accept this, because there's no way in hell the DNC is going to have it any other way. 

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

But they're next, and -- to mix a metaphor -- Clinton's weak showing is the canary in the coal mine.","Reddit",182,0.597269624573379,20,14.65,1.42662116040956,1643,1295,9.54600682593857,71.2730998293516,6.71223549488055,8.16732668370921,89,7,6.95762969283276,9.30034129692833,8.04673846971554,7.725,5,7,9.8885125484394,5,283,0.0176678445229682,-0.555555555555556,-0.222222222222222,0.333333333333333,0.555555555555556,0.5,0.444444444444444,0.666666666666667,0.444444444444444,0.5,0.555555555555556,0.555555555555556,0.833333333333333,1.16666666666667

Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes.","Reddit",227,0.5,33,13.1515151515152,1.43778801843318,2465,1927,9.50023739701159,71.8493457617651,6.05859167714006,8.05655520285714,89,7,6.50498952660243,9.35483870967742,7.64159272625409,6.96969696969697,4,6,9.87386591682226,5,418,0.00478468899521531,-0.433333333333333,-0.0666666666666667,0.0333333333333333,0.433333333333333,0.566666666666667,0.166666666666667,0.266666666666667,0.433333333333333,0.333333333333333,0.233333333333333,0.6,0.7,0.733333333333333

Now, if Sanders' purpose is to fuel his supporters, he more or less was successful at that.  He did what his supporters more or less expected him to do.  But to voters on the fence, his manner came off as being rude and probably condescending.  A lot of snarky remarks and finger pointing won't be perceived positively (let alone directed at a woman) by objective undecided voters.

To me, last night Sanders won when he challenged Clinton to release the transcripts.  She was clearly evasive.  But his sarcastic remarks were a turn off.  Clinton won in portraying herself was someone who could get things done.  Two particular points she made were convincing: one is about the minimum wage (she would sign a $15 minimum wave if the bill was on her desk, but to get there, you couldn't do it in one step) and fracking (her explanation how foreign countries have go to through fracking first before getting to green energy was convincing).

On Israel and Palestinian, I found Sanders' statements very eloquent (he can't explain his position better than that).  Unfortunately, the entire tone came off as not being supportive of Israel as Clinton.  It would win the Palestinian vote in NY.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.

Overall, Sanders' supporters will vote for him. Clinton's supporters will vote for her.  For those people on the edge, I think Clinton did a little better.  I thought Clinton's closing remarks were very effective.  She was very appealing to NYers who voted her to the Senate.  She was asking them and talking to them directly.

Since the collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850's, every US president has been either a Democrat or a Republican.

There are a few ""third parties"" on the ballot in a majority of the states: The Libertarians, the Greens, and the Constitution Party.  But they typically receive less than 4% of the vote combined.

There have, however, been times in the past when third parties have done better:


The Populists got 8.5% of the popular vote in the 1892 presidential election, and went on to win some governorships and Congressional seats.
The Progressives came in second in the 1912 presidential election as Theodore Roosevelt (formerly a Republican) made a run for a third term.  They did succeed in electing a California governor and some other state and local offices.
The Dixiecrats won a few Southern states in 1948.
The American Independent Party, another segregationist party, won the Deep South in 1968.
Ross Perot, founder of the Reform Party, won 18.9% of the popular vote in 1992.

"7668",1460737844,"The points raised in the article are all likely true, but that does not mean that the issue should be dismissed out-of-hand.

If part of the effect is due to ""Women also tend to leave the workforce for periods to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay, and choose careers that tend to have lower pay."", then we need to look at a way to address this. 

When my child was born, I asked my boss if I could work part-time for six months to help my wife out. I wanted to work a ""90%"" schedule where I could take off every other Friday to give my wife a break (I had used up my vacation for parental leave). He looked at me like I had two heads and told me that the logistics of that were too hard to work out (the company is mid-sized, with over 500 employees). He would not let me do this even though I assured him that I could still do 100% of my duties in 90% of the time.

A number of women had part-time schedules in the company, but they were almost universally looked down upon. So there was not only a different standard in allowing part-time work (women could grudgingly get this, men could not), but there was a different opinion given when this was used.

Of course, the ""corporate"" message is ""yes, you should definitely be penalized, career-wise, if you choose to work less"". That is the assumption that needs to be challenged, because we are all humans, we have parents, we have children, and we wouldn't have much of a society if we make child-rearing a taboo corporate activity.","Reddit",164,0.547038327526132,11,26.0909090909091,1.32404181184669,1525,1180,13.6419385492556,68.3387899904973,10.9806113398796,7.24018854450313,89,89,10.2091479252455,8.34494773519164,10.3572548135463,15.2272727272727,7,9,11.5673854785899,5,282,0.00354609929078014,0.272727272727273,0.272727272727273,0.272727272727273,0,0.909090909090909,0.0909090909090909,0.0909090909090909,0.454545454545455,0.272727272727273,0.272727272727273,0.272727272727273,0.454545454545455,0.727272727272727

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we're seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he's doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis' outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America's treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said.

> The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also won't explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

> ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

> ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

> Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldn't get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning.","Reddit",159,0.633333333333333,15,16,1.79583333333333,1586,1288,15.5666666666667,38.6675,11.847,13.9051950475,13,13,11.8408333333333,11.625,9.26642685541016,11.7333333333333,8,10,14.1671744697615,5,236,0.0720338983050847,-0.5,-0.25,0.5625,0.1875,0.0625,0.0625,0.3125,0.5,0.1875,0.0625,0.8125,0.5,1.0625

  Note that the government in most of countries with majority of Muslim people are secular, e.g Turkey, or secular in some parts e.g Syria. Maybe it is a surprise for some people when they hear  Political forms of Islam are not tolerated by the government in Syria. (Syria has separate secular and religious courts. Civil and criminal cases are heard in secular courts, while the Sharia courts handle personal, family, and religious matters in cases between Muslims or between Muslims and non-Muslims. Non-Muslim communities have their own religious courts using their own religious law)
   So they dont apply ""sharia law"".

I pretended not to be registered and looked over the form and sure enough ""Republican"" was checked off on all of the forms in their possession. I told them then that I was already registered as an independent, that party affiliation was NOT required to vote and that these people were obviously lying, and I said it loudly enough that everyone around could hear me. They got up and walked away immediately. I found a campus security officer close by and told them that the people were scamming students and they told me there was nothing they could or would do about it.

"7379",1460747256,"Well, let's see. She's been involved in some pretty interesting and often complicated issues of energy and environment in Alaska. She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

Not only did it screw my credit, I only found out about it cause when I tried to get my first cell phone (this was in 2001 so cells were just finally going mainstream), Sprint wouldn't let me hey one cause they said I owed them $450 about in long distance phone calls to Mexico.

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me. I remember how embarrassed I was when I got turned down from a job after being interviewed and hired and then my background check came back and they said my credit was worrisome so they didn't hire me, saying they would be happy to talk to me again when I resolved it all.

Identity theft by illegals is a massive problem, and even worse, many of them abuse it further than just getting a job, because why not when you can.

He literally brings up how he's going to pay for his proposals in *every single debate*. Clinton? Not so much. ""Closing loopholes"". Well, okay. This is exactly the answer that Romney gave to Obama during the 2012 debates on how his plans wouldn't effect the revenue in a negative way.

When trusts were broken up by the courts under the Sherman Act, correct me if I'm wrong, the companies did the restructuring themselves. His answer was totally spot on, the Federal government says ""that's enough power for you"", not ""here is how we're going to internally change your company"".

We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways.

Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

But the problem is that merely wishing or pointing out how absurd it is does nothing to change it. What does change it is knowing these rules, and then voting in spite of them. The only way these rules will ever change is to know them, follow them, and then vote for candidates who promote something simpler, something more democratic, something more open. The only way voting will *ever* become a national holiday, is if enough voters without a national holiday demand one. Pointing out the flaws isn't enough, nor was it ever enough. Sitting there with high-minded principles does nothing.

[Vermont And Maine Named The Two Safest States In The Country](



> Vermont is the safest state in the country, with a violent crime rate of just 115 incidents per 100,000 residents. The state also led the nation in nominal terms, with a total of only 720 violent crimes reported in 2013. Violent crime in the state has also fallen dramatically. Vermont's violent crime rate fell 19.2% in 2013 from 2012, the largest improvement in the country. **As in other safe states, Vermont's relatively well-educated population may have contributed to its low crime rates**. Nearly 36% of adults had attained at least a bachelor's degree as of last year, and 91.5% had completed at least high school, both among the highest rates nationwide.","Reddit",104,0.60126582278481,10,15.8,1.42405063291139,893,699,10.8769620253165,70.3233164556962,7.30727848101266,8.33934477197975,89,7,7.37579746835443,8.9873417721519,8.36062198643139,8.7,5,8,10.7935534051686,5,142,0,-3.14285714285714,-0.571428571428571,-0.428571428571429,1.42857142857143,0.285714285714286,0.571428571428571,1,0.714285714285714,0.142857142857143,0.714285714285714,0.857142857142857,1.71428571428571,1.28571428571429

There is one example of a system that I know isn't influenced by money. Random dictatorship (a random candidate becomes leader). Random dictatorship isn't common in practice though.

The reason I ask is that Democracy Spring is happening in the U.S., and it seems to focus on addressing the problem through direct litigation. The problem could better be addressed by fixing our voting system (we currently have the very bad Plurality voting system) that I hypothesize to be especially manipulable by advertising and media.

Here is a list of voting systems by country. This page on Electoral reform may also be useful, as many of the reform movements mentioned specifically focus on voting systems.

"17742",1460633784,"Actually, it does not affect non-EU immigrants at all.

EU laws grant that nationals of EU countries have the right of residence in other EU countries. This is not a ""free for all"" right, though; after a few months of residence they have to show they have a way to sustain themselves (v.g. a work) or may be deported.

People who are not national of EU countries(the usual expression is third country national) are covered by the Schengen agreement. The Schengen Treaty led to the abolition of internal borders between the signatories. When a third country national is granted a Schengen visa (by any country in the agreement), the visa is 1 valid to visit all of the Schengen countries (although you are supposed to apply to the country at which you will be staying more). In exchange, there is a common policy for issuing such visas2 and the information of applicants is shared between the Schengen states3.

The question is that the UK (and Ireland) got an opt-out of the Schengen agreements, that allowed them to be part of the EU and not of the Schengen Treatry. So in the UK, for third party nationals, visas issued under the Schengen Treatry are not valid.

So, the rules for allowing third party nationals inside the UK are already under control of the UK government, either by specifying for each third party national which ones are free to enter without visa, which ones can enter with  certain visas4, and which are the requirements to get an UK issued visa.

cause the government
A couple of links:





What does European Union &quot;freedom of movement&quot; mean, and how much can individual countries restrict intra-EU immigration? (this is about the EU nationals).

1 Or should be, as some national legislations fail to fully comply with the Schengen agreement.

2 Due to the refugee crisis there has been some talks to create just a single entity for issuing Schengen visas, but at the time of writting there is not a solid initiative towards that.

3 IIRC some states might still issue ""national"" visas that are valid for their territory but not for any other country; but I am not fully sure about that.

4 As Bregalad points, there is at least one situation in which the UK allows entry with a visa issued by another country; it looks like Indian and Chinese nationals may enter the UK using some visas issues by Ireland (and viceversa).

> Bunnatine (Bunny) H. Greenhouse is a former chief contracting officer Senior Executive Service (Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. On June 27, 2005, she testified to a Congressional panel, alleging specific instances of waste, fraud, and other abuses and irregularities by Halliburton with regard to its operations in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. She described one of the Halliburton contracts (secret, no-bid contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR)—a subsidiary of Halliburton) as ""the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career"".[1]

> A long-time government employee, Greenhouse was hired by Lieutenant General Joe Ballard in 1997 to oversee contracts at the Army Corps of Engineers. After Ballard retired in 2000, Greenhouse's performance reviews, which had been exemplary throughout her public career, suddenly soured. Greenhouse filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint alleging race and gender discrimination, which her attorney states has never been investigated. In August 2005, she was demoted in what her lawyer called an ""obvious reprisal"" for her revelations about the Halliburton contracts.[2][3]

The harsh reality is, with our voting system, the only candidate that can beat the republican is the democrat. So if you don't vote for the democrat, you're not helping to defeat the republican. I say this as someone who agrees more with the green party's platform than the democratic party's platform. I'd love to vote green, but I'll only do so if it will actually accomplish something! Being principled and voting your conscience are only things that you do to make yourself feel good. I know nobody likes to be told how to vote, but in my opinion, the most noble thing to do is vote with the idea of civic duty in mind, and cast the vote that's going to do the most good for the country.

I'm really pulling for Bernie, and I've given him a lot of money and volunteered my time phone banking for him. But if Hillary ends up being the democratic nominee, you bet your ass I'll be sucking it up and casting my vote for her.

  We Want An End To The Robbery
  By The Capitalists Of Our Black Community.


That's point number three of the Ten-Points Program, a manifesto written by Black Panther founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. I don't know how much more direct you can make it.

The Black Panthers were Marxists, students of a school of conflict sociology. AnCaps and other neoliberals will characterize an essential conflict in government vs. private interest, but that is not, precisely, fundamental to the Marxist conceit. Rather, the essential conflict is class based, with capitalism being the most recent development in exploitation. For Marxists like the Black Panthers, racism is not just some kind of hateful whimsy that only becomes violently destructive when the government jackboots get in on it. Rather, it is itself a product of capitalist self-interest. 

You've heard of how ""workers must seize the means of production,"" right? In chattel slavery, such as was practiced in the American South, the workers are indistinguishable from the means of production; they're owned as property in exactly the same commodified manner as a plantation field or a cotton 'gin. Racist exclusion was no less useful for maintaining an exploitable underclass after the civil war, either. For example, the prisoner leasing programs provided slaves-in-all-but-name as a direct byproduct of racist belligerence among law enforcement. The draft during the Vietnam War press-ganged thousands of young men to fight the enemies of capitalism, but passed over people who were in university, which, generally speaking, did not include a lot of black people. Finally, because obviously there are also plenty of working-class white people, racism is a method of division which foils any effective anti-capitalist sentiment by stirring up proletariat infighting.

Pursuant to the last point, I'll also note that, as time went on, the Panters curved away from Black Nationalism and into Revolutionary Internationalism. Yes, the Black Panthers were anti-establishment, but not because they were merely laissez-faire. They were anti-establishment because, in their opinion, the establishment in question was a longstanding edifice of capitalist values. The answer, for them, is not to simply open up a power vacuum where that government stood, if it just means that the consolidated power of the bourgeois withstands the move to ""anarchy"" and starts cutting deals to trade food to people in return for their eternal bondage. That's just a regression. Rather, to the Black Panthers (and other Marxist groups), the answer is solidarity among the exploited class and opposition to the ideologies which created a class disparity, of which racial disparity is only one kind. That doesn't mean you don't have a government. For many, it means you run one.

So, to answer your question:


  Why don't black people embrace anarcho-capitalism when it would encourage groups like the Black Panthers?


Because the only way an anarcho-capitalist encourages an actual Black Panther is by provoking him.

I did an analysis of what the delegates totals would be if the South voted today, and if Bernie lost the black vote by 40 points (30-70) Clinton's lead would be about ~115 less, or around 100.  This is assuming he still does a little worse than he has in statess like Missouri, but I think the 30% is a reasonable mark.  

So yes, mathematically it did distort reality.  This isn't to say that the South should be disregarded, it is saying that having the South first as a monolithic block definitely had an impact on the race.

>CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Colorado's Democratic nominating process:
""Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Colorado's Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturday's 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.""

Assuming the candidate doesn't drop out on her or his own:

The delegates have complete control over the convention.  They could vote in a rule prior to the nomination vote that said that the candidate was not eligible and vote in someone else.  Many of them may still be bound to vote for that candidate, but the rules would say that the candidate could not win.  There is no rule saying explicitly that having enough bound delegates to make up a majority of the delegates awards victory.  

For example, if Hillary Clinton is convicted of abuse of classified information after winning 2383 bound delegates in primaries, her own delegates could vote in a rule precluding anyone convicted of a felony from winning the nomination.  They'd be bound to vote for her on the first ballot but that wouldn't count.  Most would be unbound on later ballots and could vote for someone else.  That someone else might be Bernie Sanders but not necessarily.  They could pick someone else entirely.  

To continue, Clinton could then turn state's evidence against Donald Trump on a bribery charge.  Trump gets convicted too but has at least 1237 bound delegates.  The Republican delegates modify rule 40 to exclude votes for convicted felons.  Some of the delegates may be unbound immediately, e.g. Minnesota and Oklahoma are only bound if the candidate is nominated.  Cruz, Kasich, or some other candidate could be nominated.  

Note:  neither scenario is likely.  This is just a semi-realistic chain of events to illustrate what could happen.  

All that said, if either party did this, they'd need a really good reason to avoid a backlash.  They'd probably try hard to get a unanimous decision on the rule change so as to provide cover against charges of interfering with the election.  They'd specifically try to recruit the previous supporters of the candidate to be removed.

"2958",1460625392,"So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else.

Longitude (in degrees, minutes, seconds) east or west of a prime meridian (such as through the Greenwich Observatory)
A reference geoid or ellipsoid (such as NAD 83), or the use of local surveying relative to mountains or stars.


Sometimes the boundary is clarified by using a map projection (that is based on a reference ellipsoid like NAD 83 and a UTM zone definition), with units in feet or meters relative to the origin of the zone.  For example, the U.S. Supreme Court ratified such an ocean boundary (measured in meters, with a precision of 1 millimeter) between the United States and California.  Most of the ruling is a data dump from a GIS system.

In many U.S. states, property boundaries are defined using chains of offsets.  Each offset is measured in feet (often to a precision of 0.01 feet), with an angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds.

"17678",1460408854,"The restriction on the president of Pakistan is set forth in the contituion of Pakistan. The answer to your question depends on how the government of Pakistan reads the phrase ""two consecutive terms"". This can be read to mean that after two terms (10 years), the President must allow someone else to serve for one term (similar to the way Grover Cleveland was President of the United States for two nonconsecutive terms). It can also be read to mean that he is forbidden to serve as President again after a period that would constitute two consecutive terms (10 years), similar to the way a President of the United States cannot serve for more than 10 years as President even if they are not consecutive. Note that the United States allows for the case of a Vice President filling out the term of a deceased president and then being elected for two terms on his own.


  44    Term of office of President.
  (1)   Subject to the Constitution, the
  President shall hold office for a term of five years from the day he
  enters upon his office:
  
  Provided that the President shall, notwithstanding the expiration of his
  term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office. 
  
  (2)   Subject to the Constitution, a person holding office as
  President shall be eligible for re-election to that office, but no
  person shall hold that office for more than two consecutive terms.  
  
  (3)   The President may, by writing under his hand addressed to the
  Speaker of the National Assembly, resign his office.

Our group had to sit in front of these people while they hurled vitriolic shit at us for an hour.

It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd. It's the constant defeatism and uninspiring approval of the truly meager progress being made that shifts focus away from the biggest problems in today's political landscape, which *are* structural and pervasive, not specific and discrete. How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

The rise of both Sanders *and* Trump is showing us that people are *not* happy with status quo politics or politicians. That the majority of people want *drastic* change, not faux pragmatism that is really leading us nowhere fast. The fact that the media is doing more to instill complacency than shine light on the problems that millions of people are already realizing without their help is not only depressing, it's scary.","Reddit",162,0.625498007968127,10,25.1,1.58565737051793,1501,1204,15.6176892430279,47.2118864541833,13.7129880478088,11.2249673642853,13,13,12.9097569721116,10.7370517928287,10.9726933794762,16.15,9,12,13.968273953766,5,241,0.0663900414937759,0,-0.4,0.9,0.3,0.5,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.3,0.3,1.1,0.6,1.5

In Kollam district of Kerala state Kollam Hindu Temple Fireworks Blast incident took place in which More than 100 people were died. Few days before of incident taking  place, district collector and the district police commissioner of Kollam district refused permission for cracking of Fireworks . But as these 2 officer were Muslims and festival was of Hindus, some people and politicians gave it a communal color and demanded for dismissal of these 2 officer. People done celebrations with Fireworks and the bad incident took place.
In the 2nd incident where the Hindu devotee woman wanted to enter inside the core of the  another Hindu temple named as Mahalaxmi Temple in Kolhapur district of Maharashtra state for praying .But temple administration refused to permit her as they think that it is against Hindu culture. But with the Court's order the district collector and district police commissioner of Kolhapur district helped her to get inside the core of the temple.  But while entering the core of the temple the Hindu woman devotee was badly beaten by the people . Here,both these officers are from Hindu religion who helped that Hindu devotee to enter inside the Hindu temple. But after that some people as well as politicians are demanding dismissal of both district collector and district police commissioner. 


Here,as a bystander I really don't understand how to summarise the religion based Indian politics from these 2 incidents. What conclusion can be drawn from it? Also,How can the religious conflict be minimized in India like secular country to maintain the peace and amity?

>I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001, and continue to oppose the bill's reliance on ***high-stakes standardized testing*** to direct draconian interventions. In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on ***standardized testing***, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.



It doesn't really matter in either case because, like millions of New York parents, both Clinton and Sanders can obviously be concerned about education reform and still be against standardized testing as currently implemented.

All planned to vote for Sanders. It shouldn't matter much as Hillary won by a blowout in this state, but it still happened. 

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana. If I called breathlessly to a local election official with how several people I know plus dozens upon dozens of people on Internet were disenfranchised, it would all be shrugged off. Even Mark Crispin Miller's reports about the elections of 2000 and 2004 never gained much traction. He and others like him get pigeonholed as tin foil hat conspiracists.

"17555",1460063810,"The provision that Iran's acquirement of heavy weapons be regulated by the UNSC is not legally binding, i.e. it is not subject to enforcement under Chapter 7. But even if it were, a permanent member like Russia could always get away with violating a UNSC resolution, as any fallout from attempting to enforce the provisions could be dealt with by Russian vetoes.

If Russia were to proceed with such actions that the US would strongly object to, then US-Russian relations could worsen. A lot depends here on what the US and Russia have discussed privately at the time the text of the provisions was drafted. E.g. did Russia get guarantees from the US that any proposed Russian weapons sales would be evaluated objectively based on Iran's needs to modernize its army and not face blanked bans? Did the US change its mind after the Iranian missile tests? So, these are all relevant factors that we can only guess about. 

It is quite analogous to UNSC resolution 1441 which was adopted after the US gave guarantees that the enforcement provisions in it would not be used to start a war against Iraq. A second UNSC resolution would be needed. But later the US and Britain changed their mind on that, in their opinion the relevant circumstances had changed. Whatever disagreements there were, there was of course nothing the other UNSC members could do to stop the US and Britain.

>It's not that he's unconcerned with terrorism or rogue states, both of which he discussed at length. But he clearly drew from his experiences in the 1980s and '90s an acute sensitivity to the world-shaking stakes of great power rivalries, and a firm belief in the role that deterrence and nuclear weapons still play.

>Carter described a world where not just American power but also global peace and stability will be increasingly challenged by other powers. He returned over and over to the same answer to this problem: the power of deterrence, backed up by overwhelming American superiority and, ultimately, by nuclear weapons.

>But deterrence works on decades-old understandings of warfare that are, today, rapidly changing. As countries develop new tools and techniques of war, Carter warned that deterrence, the foundation on which American power and global stability are built, needs to change as well.

>That is not a challenge that grabs as many headlines as terrorism or rogue states. But the stakes — the international order as know it, 70 years of peace between the major powers, and the thousands of nuclear warheads backing it up — could not be higher.

We used to be so fiscally conservative. I grew up here and I was raised with the same attitude. You cover your ass because you never know what's going to knock you for a loop in the future. But the oil boom came along and suddenly we had hundred dollar bills flying out our assholes. So much money in the state coffers that nobody would ever think there would ever be hard times again. Why not use that ""extra"" money to push for some headline grabbing anti-choice crap that we could never have achieved before? It's not like we can't afford it, right?

Then the price of oil drops overnight and the wells start getting capped. Oh no, the sky is falling! We can't pay our bills! Whatever will we do?

Oh, and by the way, you owe $245,000 for your circlejerk ""Think Of The Babies!"" bullshit. And who gets to pay? Everyone in this state gets to pay so that you could feel superior to those librul, progressive, baby-killers. For all the good you *didn't* do!

Your second case would depend on who sets the temple rules.","Stack",71,0.676190476190476,5,21,1.41904761904762,595,467,12.9714285714286,65.4685714285714,10.0182857142857,8.94161813281904,89,89,9.34476190476191,9.28571428571428,9.66436754267966,13.1,6,9,12.3406265835799,5,105,0.0380952380952381,-0.4,-0.6,0.2,0.6,0.8,0,0.6,1,0.6,0,1.4,1.2,1.4

I don't understand where these arbitrary differences and categories come from. I fully understand that much of that is simply my ignorance of the complicated laws and regulations that govern this stuff, but at the end of the day I'm not sure that can account for the grave injustice our tax system currently delivers to the average person in this country.

I'm sure there's some fancy-pants economists' answer as to why business need to be treated specially, but I'm not sure I care. ""Society needs these businesses to keep the economy alive."" Okay, and society needs middle class people to be able to afford to live too, so why do we see a higher value in the well-being of a corporation than we do in the well-being of a household? (Excepting the obvious increased impact of the failure of a corporation when compared to personal bankruptcy. My claim here is that what we have today is not valued proportionately.)

Businesses don't need help. They live and die by demand. If there is demand and they go bankrupt then they are mismanaging their business. Households need help, households need support. The demand for stable households is far more abstract than the instant gratification of being able to spend $10.00 on an App in Apple's store so they can take $3.33 of that, and so that the developer who actually made the fucking thing might get a penny. Millions (Billions?) of people wanted Apple to make an phone that integrated into all of Apple's other services. How many people asked me to start a family? How many would if we could actually appreciate the consequences of that choice; if it were as simple as the last line on the page being red or black?

I'm relatively well off. My combined household income is over 100k and we've got about 230k in debt (Mortgage and car) and I'm young-ish still, I think. My wife and are are happy because happy is relative, and a lot of people we know are still living with their parents, but every day my wife has to leave our daughter and go to work we feel like slaves to a system in which we have no stake or voice.

Today the American dream is to work a third of your life, sleep a third of your life, have strangers raise your kids for you, and then wonder how things got so fucked up -- and it's a fucking nightmare.","Reddit",260,0.521920668058455,26,18.4230769230769,1.38622129436326,2551,2007,10.9600449654729,70.8612554199454,7.5163401316846,7.22966149431231,89,7,7.95241127348643,8.75782881002088,8.78591530190837,10.8653846153846,5,7,10.4758031067317,5,459,0.0065359477124183,-0.5,0.0909090909090909,-0.0909090909090909,0.272727272727273,0.318181818181818,0.0909090909090909,0.409090909090909,0.272727272727273,0.5,0.0909090909090909,0.681818181818182,0.909090909090909,0.818181818181818

"17605",1460153826,"Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be held early in only three cases:


A vote of no confidence passes; in this case, a 14-day clock starts. If, by the end of the 14 days, a motion that the House of Commons has confidence in the government passes, then there's no election. If no government succeeds in forming and gaining confidence in two weeks, there's an election. 
The House of Commons, by a two-thirds majority, votes to hold an early election. 
The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act is repealed/modified (this isn't a provision of the Act, it just applies to all legislation). 


A petition cannot possibly force early elections. It could sway Parliament, but if the Tories stay united and don't want a dissolution then there will be no dissolution. The Queen used to have the power to dissolve Parliament, and could theoretically do it against the advice of the PM if she wanted to cause a constitutional crisis (Canada and Australia both saw uses of reserve powers in the 20th century, and both were very controversial); however, this is no longer possible after the FTPA. The Queen still has the power to dismiss the PM and appoint a new one, but again, this is a theoretical power more than a real one.

It would reveal that Clinton's policy positions on — for instance — breaking up ""too-big-to-fail"" banks are almost certainly insincere, as they have been trotted out merely for the purposes of a presidential campaign.""","Reddit",89,0.644444444444444,4,33.75,1.54814814814815,819,659,18.2407407407407,41.6054166666667,18.4367777777778,12.0249229212652,13,13,15.8406481481482,10.6666666666667,12.8354976529934,21.125,12,13,14.9062281516336,5,129,0.0310077519379845,0.333333333333333,-1,0,0.333333333333333,0.333333333333333,0.666666666666667,0.333333333333333,0.333333333333333,0.666666666666667,0,1,1.33333333333333,1.33333333333333

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it.

[Hillary Clinton Says Honduras Coup Not Illegal In NY Daily News Editorial Board Interview](


""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in ""the coup in Honduras,"" which took place when she was secretary of state.

>As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn't do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

>But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There's been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **""The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.""


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, ""The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.""

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders' rationalizations for a ""patently illegal act"" and outlined the following: ""the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country""; ""Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president""; ""Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process""; and ""Zelaya's arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.""


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***","Reddit",261,0.51380042462845,21,22.4285714285714,1.67515923566879,2858,2285,17.2941461935092,42.3515286624204,12.6342857142857,11.405412967921,13,13,12.9240218380346,10.3821656050955,10.4311803651132,15.8809523809524,9,11,15.4700424275458,5,458,0.0480349344978166,-0.75,-0.375,0.25,0.875,0.625,0.375,0.9375,0.0625,0.5625,0.5,1.75,1.0625,1.3125

"5940",1460526861,"So just to throw some extra info out there for discussion, renewables struggle to ever be cheaper after you remove all the tax incentives and rebates, especially where real estate carries a premium cost in the heavily populated areas of the world.  The rebates given in tax credits are paid for from the tax base which we all pay into, so if everyone did it, the increase of taxes would be much greater than our dirt cheap fossil fuels right now.  The pollutants generated from the mass manufacture of solar panels can also be pretty nasty and harmful to the environment, though it's getting better all the time. 

Additionally, the fundamental piece missing from renewables is you can't control them to work when you want.  In a 100% renewable generation profile, where will your power come from in the middle of the night when the wind isn't blowing. You can't make it blow, and can't make the sun shine.

"2795",1460615853,"Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

"17768",1460709340,"FiveThirtyEight did a reasonably good job of analyzing this for the bound delegates.  It doesn't really cover the unbound delegates.  

I'm not going to repeat the analysis they give there.  It is certainly possible for Trump to make it to 1237 purely with bound delegates.  He would need to win 479 of the 744 remaining or 64%.  But their analyses suggests that he will fall about 80 short.  Assuming that there are about 200 unbound delegates on the first ballot, he would therefore need about 40% of them to make a majority.  

So Trump either needs to outperform their expectations by about 20% or he needs to convert enough unbound delegates to make up the difference.  

New York is an instructive example.  538's path to 1237 has Trump winning 91 of 95 delegates from New York.  But if he finishes third (or second with the first place finisher over 50%) in one district and second in another, he'd get 0 of 3 and 1 of 3 respectively.  That would take him down to 90.  Even if he finishes first in five districts but below the 50% mark, he'd only get 2 of 3 delegates in each district and fall short.  Polls show Trump with 50% to 60% of the vote statewide, averaging about 54%.  At 60% he might have enough to make 50% in each district, but at 50% he almost certainly wouldn't.  If he falls short of 91 delegates in New York, he'll have to make up those delegates elsewhere.  

I haven't seen congressional district level polls of Trump support, even though that would be what's needed to predict his vote totals in New York and other states that award delegates by congressional district results.  Most projections are going to be somewhat weak without that kind of data.  

I saw on the news today that the Trump campaign is currently projecting themselves at 1265 bound delegates.  This remains possible.  It is certainly much more likely than that Cruz will pass Trump before the convention.  But it's a steep climb.  

I don't see how Trump can expect to get more than a 100 unbound delegates on the first ballot.  That would mean that he needs at least 1137 bound delegates.  And that may give him more support than he really has.  He tends to do worse in conventions and other circumstances where people can't vote for him directly.  He might well find himself stuck at 60 unbound delegates.  That would mean that he needs 1177 bound delegates.  That's about 20 delegates ahead of the 538 projection.  

You may hear a lot of talk about rule 40b.  Most of it is rather confused.  First, Cruz has won a majority of the delegates in seven states already:  Texas; Kansas; Maine; Idaho; Utah; Wisconsin; Colorado.  He also will likely get the vote of a majority of the Louisiana delegates (having signed all ten of the unbound delegates) and seems well poised for victory in Wyoming.  Either would allow him to met the requirement.  

Second, rule 40b doesn't prevent votes for any candidates.  It prevents them from receiving floor nominations where they get to talk on television (as covered in 40c) and from having their names read in the vote count (rule 40d).  In 2012, Ron Paul was short of the eight states but he still received 190 of the first ballot votes.  While Kasich, Cruz, and other potential candidates may appreciate getting to talk on television, they won't need to talk on television to reach delegates.  They can talk to delegates directly.  

In terms of other rules, I wouldn't expect them to have much effect either.  The rules committee won't want to give the appearance of changing the rules for this election.  In fact, I suspect that they won't want to give the impression of rules affecting the election in any way.  

Trump also has the problem that if he doesn't win on the first ballot, many of his delegates (and everyone else's) become unbound.  This is why many observers think that the first ballot is his best if not only chance to win the nomination.  If he can get to 1237 then, he wins.  If not, he probably doesn't.

It specifically has an exception for fine art, which this portrait might qualify as. If the artist wasn't trying to sell the painting, or if they released it to the public domain as in Dastar Corp v. Twentieth Century Fox, Trump would have no civil recourse.

Donald Trump's campaign website doesn't have an official position on the Freedom of Speech or the First Amendment. He has made several public statements though. In an interview (4:38 mark), he disagreed with SCOTUS's Citizens United v. FEC decision.


  ""I guess from my standpoint personally I'd almost rather not see it,"" he said of candidates seeking to raise large amounts of money from the Koch brothers. ""I see all of the money that's being raised by these folks, and they're raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and ultimately billions of dollars.""
  
  Trump has made the self-funded nature of his campaign a signature issue, insisting that unlike his rivals he cannot be bribed as he won't be in thrall to donors. ""I don't need anybody's money,"" he said, but ""I'm not sure it's the worst thing in the world.""


He has also spoken publicly about strengthening the libel laws so the press isn't protected from publishing lies.


  ""One of the things I'm going to do if I win, and I hope we do and we're certainly leading. I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.""


The press is currently protected when telling lies, unless a plaintiff can prove they acted with malice, in reckless disregard to the truth (New York Times Co. V. Sullivan).

Honestly, this is the biggest load of bullshit. Obama *explicitly* ran on a center-left message: his campaign was about ""bringing people together"" and ""being willing to compromise,"" and he's been consistent about that his entire time in office. If anything, he ran to the *right* of Hillary on some issues, such as his rejection of the individual mandate. Pretty much every commentator in 2008 pointed out how the debate between the Clinton/Obama was mostly about style. They were both direct supporters of the center-left pragmatic wing of the party.

"17785",1460754241,"The UK Government responded:

The accusations made about the Government and Prime Minister in this petition are wrong, and the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means no Government can call an early general election any more anyway.

The Government and Prime Minister have never sought to mislead the public. Nonetheless, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which came into force in 2011 under the Coalition Government, removed the power to set the general election date, and therefore to call an early general election, from the Government and gave a power to the House of Commons to call an early general election in certain circumstances.

An early general election can only be called under the Act if either a motion (as worded in section 2(2) of the Act) that there shall be an early parliamentary general election is passed by the House of Commons with at least two thirds in favour of the motion; or if a motion of no confidence (as worded in section 2(4) of the Act) is passed by the House of Commons and the House does not pass a motion of confidence (as worded in section 2(5) of the Act) in the Government or an alternative Government within 14 days. Aside from these triggers there is no way to replace the Government through an early General Election.

Not only that, the idea that ""the customer is always right"" mentality is the biggest load of shit I have *ever heard* as it makes people just forget that the people they're talking to are people, ergo, learning that those people aren't people, not caring about them, which leads to ""they're just lazy and that's why they have a job like that"", and you have nobody on your side, it's hard to keep going. 

Honestly, this country is lucky that it's as stable as it is now, because with the way most of us feel, we all could literally say, ""fuck work, fuck bills, let's save my humanity"", all join together, and just fucking *go* downtown, or to our respective state capitals, and just *protest*. 

but that would never happen, because we are all living in fear of not being able to pay rent, and some people literally are so blind to the horrible system they live in that they'll complain all day about it, but do nothing and then vote for the party that shafted them in the first place.

If it wasn't for unions fighting the ""job creators"" we would be working seven days a week from the age of ten until we died. There is something wrong with that. The fact that wages were allowed to stay so low, all while corporate profits and equity markets soared prove there is a problem. If the lowest paid workers among us get paid wages that are below poverty levels. Then every single one us will be paid less. Maybe the price of goods and services would rise with an increase in the minimum wage, but I guarantee that those price increases don't outpace the rise in wages. That is nothing more than an excuse to keep as much of the profit made off the backs of the working class as possible.

It's so important that the first amendment of the US Constitution protects this institution from state usurpation.  The interests of big business have taken it over and so often don't want us to get the very kind of information we need most, because it would modify our perceptions and behavior to be against the interests of big business owners.

"6945",1460739546,"I like how the main issue anyone has with Bernie is that he doesn't have a fully laid out plan on how to handle certain situations.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

"5266",1460554512,"This proposal makes far too much sense to ever make it through.

The US tax situation is messed up. I've now filed Dutch, French and US tax returns and the US one is by far the most effort.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

"7273",1460736221,"May I ask what the actual justification of a $15 min. wage is? I don't mean whether we should raise the minimum wage, and I agree we should, but what rationale is being used to come up with a specific $15 target at the national level? Do those that support it actually know what the impact would be, or is the assumption simply that however many min. wage earners we have will be the same number who benefit from the min. wage increase? 

If your assumption is the latter, that every min. wage worker will benefit from an increase in the min. wage to $15, might I simply suggest you're making a rather strong assumption. And I don't even necessarily mean with respect to job losses, but with respect to job availability. Raising the min. wage will be no problem for the big boys. Your Wal-marts, Targets, Home Depots etc... will have no problem paying the higher min. wage. Aren't you at least a bit curious why Wal-mart has suddenly grown warm to the idea of an increase? Could it possibly have something to do with the fact that they now have so much market share that paltry increases in costs won't actually result in any decreases in profits, but will likely increase prices at Wal-mart, at least partially offsetting the assumed benefit flowing to min. wage workers after the increase (who shop at Wal-mart already). 

An increase in the minimum wage to $15 nationally would drill many small-to-medium businesses into the ground, after which we'll only have inefficient oligopolists to buy goods from, and then eventually only even more inefficient monopolists. If you care about consumers, then you should be advocating for policies that increase competition in markets. Now again, I support modest increases in the min. wage, handled at the city/state level, as these min. wages will better reflect the highly varied regional economic differences in the U.S. But, we should be wary of large bumps in the min. wage, because at the very least it puts small-to-medium businesses at an even larger cost disadvantage to large firms than they already have. Its very similar to how we handle environmental policy. By having across the board regulations, we put small businesses at a disadvantage by ignoring their cost disadvantage, with the end result being more market power driven to large firms.

We should advocate for policies that induce businesses to pay their low-income employees more while still having a min. wage set at some morally comfortable standard of living. But everything is a trade-off, not the least of which is the efficiency/equity trade off in our macroeconomy. So, while we may feel good about supporting a $15 min. wage because we believe it will benefit all min. wage workers, the outcome isn't at all so clear cut. Most research on min. wage shows that modest increases create modest but negligible job losses. This research doesn't come from right-wingers who hate the min. wage, but objective researchers seeking the TRUE impact of increasing the min. wage. Simply yelling that everyone who is concerned about a $15 min. wage is a corporate shill really just shows a naivete as to the fact that policy has consequences, many of them unintended.

There are a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters who have intelligent and nuanced views on politics, and an understanding of the bigger picture at play. However, in my experience, these folks tend to have already been politically engaged, and are supporting Sanders because he best matches up with their viewpoint. 

A large percentage of the new people he's picked up, however, seem to be of the ""Bern or Bust"" model; it seems foolhardy to count on much of a long-term revival from his candidacy. 

Now, he does _reflect_ changing demographic and campaigning trends, but I strongly suspect his long-term impact on the trajectory of politics will be negligible.
