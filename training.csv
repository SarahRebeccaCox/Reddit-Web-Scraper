Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source]( And source [for votes... another politifact]( titled **""Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases?""**, rated **mostly true**       
Again. It's Vermont, I doubt Sanders would have made it to the Senate if he voted against the aforementioned stuff.

"4907","1460604991",">The problem for Mr Sanders is that while he's been posting sizeable wins over the past month, they've largely been in delegate-poor states, like Wyoming (14 delegates), Idaho (23) and Alaska (16). His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders.

That does not seem unfair.  Why should Wyoming outweigh Florida?

This is the only evidence they give that the Democratic primaries are rigged.

The main evidence I have seen boils down to this:  ""Bernie is the candidate of the people.  If it were not rigged, he would be winning.""  The idea that most people really prefer Clinton seems to not occur to Sanders supporters.  And they think that people who prefer Clinton are stupid, low information voters who just have not heard the Truth about Sanders.  I feel like I am talking to Jehovah Witnesses sometimes.","Reddit",111,0.664596273,11,14.63636364,1.447204969,947,750,10.32659514,69.54555054,7.829175607,9.568318153,9,9,7.195200452,9.751552795,8.257228238,7.954545455,6,8,10.43686959,5,153,0.006535948,0.7,0.5,0.5,0.1,0.1,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.3,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.8

Then I worked at fast food and a photography studio doing menial labour.... Because that's exactly what I was qualified to do. As I got bigger physically, I got factory jobs feeding filthy bottles into a washer for 8 hours non stop or loading tricks at 2 am for next day delivery.  These jobs all sucked and all paid the minimum allowed by law. I had many more jobs not listed here but the gist is there. Slowly I learned new things. Picked up skills and short course certification. Got better jobs that paid above minimum. Learned work ethic and how to keep my expectations real. I'm no millionaire today. I make $80K. Not a Rockefeller but it's decent and I love my job. The job that took 30 unrelated crappy jobs beforehand to get.  I know more than a few 20 year olds who have nothing of value to put on a resume.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

> Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

> The saga continues.

> > He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

> > He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

The federal government is going to have to address this seriously. This is undemocratic on so many levels. A foreign country doing these shenanigans would be barred from federal aid.

It's a side effect of the presidency and first-past-the-post voting for Congress.  Because you can only vote for one candidate, people tend to pick one of the two most viable candidates.  If you pick a less viable candidate, then you can be almost certain that your vote won't count.  This is called Duverger's Law.  

It would be possible for regional parties to develop.  For example, the California Democrats could fracture into moderates and liberals.  The moderates might replace the current Republican party in California.  However, in some states, this would mean choosing between voting in the primaries for a presidential candidate and local candidates (Congress, state legislature, etc.).  

Note that other countries with first-past-the-post voting have parliamentary systems where it's easier for parties to compete regionally.  Alliances can be made after the election to determine a prime minister.  Whereas in a presidential system, the president is elected as part of the election.  

If you wanted to change this behavior in the US, you would want to either eliminate the presidency or implement ranked voting.  Either of those things would make it less important that there are only two viable candidates.  

Note that proportional electors without ranked voting would increase the chances that the House of Representatives would choose the President.  That's the backup plan if no one gets a majority of the electors (270).  Obviously three or more candidates with electors increases the chance that there won't be a majority winner.  With just two, that can only happen with a tie.

But to voters on the fence, his manner came off as being rude and probably condescending.  A lot of snarky remarks and finger pointing won't be perceived positively (let alone directed at a woman) by objective undecided voters.

To me, last night Sanders won when he challenged Clinton to release the transcripts.  She was clearly evasive.  But his sarcastic remarks were a turn off.  Clinton won in portraying herself was someone who could get things done.  Two particular points she made were convincing: one is about the minimum wage (she would sign a $15 minimum wave if the bill was on her desk, but to get there, you couldn't do it in one step) and fracking (her explanation how foreign countries have go to through fracking first before getting to green energy was convincing).

On Israel and Palestinian, I found Sanders' statements very eloquent (he can't explain his position better than that).  Unfortunately, the entire tone came off as not being supportive of Israel as Clinton.  It would win the Palestinian vote in NY.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.

Overall, Sanders' supporters will vote for him. Clinton's supporters will vote for her.  For those people on the edge, I think Clinton did a little better.  I thought Clinton's closing remarks were very effective.  She was very appealing to NYers who voted her to the Senate.  She was asking them and talking to them directly.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.  




( 

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Conn Clinton +6

Maryland Clinton +22

Penn  Clinton +14

Does ""partly"" mean the linkage between the trade deal and the military bidding process was inferred?

Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it.

As our financial statements clearly show, weƒ__ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years ƒ__ thatƒ__s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone whoƒ__s counting. Weƒ__ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see ƒ__Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straightƒ_ at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language ƒ__ talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified ƒ__given yearƒ_ ƒ__ but that doesnƒ__t make his contention any less false.

and

>Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesnƒ__t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sandersƒ__s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Bostonƒ__s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. Weƒ__re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

> Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, ƒ__so messed upƒ_.

Before throwing the baby out with the bathwater, it would be great if people would actually get to know the process in their state before suggesting just scrapping it.  It's annoying that Trump and Bernie supporters are throwing flaming fits because they didn't bother to figure out the rules of the game while other candidates did.  Not that I wouldn't like reform in my home state for the stuff that should be changed in both party's systems but it's not all evil cause there has to be a structure to select candidates.
 
TLDR; The Colorado election process is a complex game best played by people who understand the rules.  Trump didn't figure them out but Cruz did.  I'm a Democrat, I have no skin in the Republican's game so I'm not defending them. I'm also not arguing either party has a great process, both need reform but they're not rigged here.

> The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also wonƒ__t explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

> ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

> ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

> Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldnƒ__t get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

All planned to vote for Sanders. It shouldn't matter much as Hillary won by a blowout in this state, but it still happened. 

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana. If I called breathlessly to a local election official with how several people I know plus dozens upon dozens of people on Internet were disenfranchised, it would all be shrugged off. Even Mark Crispin Miller's reports about the elections of 2000 and 2004 never gained much traction. He and others like him get pigeonholed as tin foil hat conspiracists.

"6009","1460486343","If you buy the suspect premise of the article that Hillary's refusal to condemn New York's massive (and [massively popular]( standardized testing ""opt-out"" movement is the equivalent of ""abandoning education reform"" then you should probably know that Sanders has similarly refused to condemn the opt-out movement and has a lengthy history of opposition to standardized testing with language that mirrors the New York opt-outs' own criticisims of the practice:

>I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001, and continue to oppose the bill's reliance on ***high-stakes standardized testing*** to direct draconian interventions. In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on ***standardized testing***, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.



It doesn't really matter in either case because, like millions of New York parents, both Clinton and Sanders can obviously be concerned about education reform and still be against standardized testing as currently implemented.

We know a grand jury has been convened (because they gave Bryan Pagliano immunity). So that means they intend to bring charges against *somebody* and they have enough to convict *somebody*.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

Also, the fact that they're moving SO carefully and SO slowly, and the business with extraditing Guccifer, etc, it seems to me that they would not go to such painstaking lengths and seemingly be walking on eggshells if they were not going after Hillary but merely one of her aides.

- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

Bernie promptly complied with the demand and it apparently contained nothing interesting after all.

This seems to just make Hillary Clinton look bad as it is an opportunity to contrast Bernie's (relatively) mundane Senator's salary and Social Security benefit to her great wealth, and his apparent transparency with her steadfast refusal to release her Wall Street speech transcripts, which Bernie and his supporters have been demanding for months, and the seeming motivation for the tax return demand.

Was this strategy of attack successful and I'm just not aware of it? What did they believe they would find in the Sanders tax return? Why did they think this was a good strategy to attack Bernie?

  Does he have a more specific basis for this event to be a greater

I don't see that Putin claims to make a comparison. On the world level it was a major event. For the Russians, it was the event.

What I remember most strongly of the time when the Berlin Wall fell, and consequently the collapse of Russia, was the West's lack of aid when it was asked for. Russia was in dire straights, and collectively, on a political basis, we didn't help them. That social upheaval could have been mitigated. 

My understanding is that Putin has been hard pressed to take the country back from organised crime groups. I agree with Putin's statement, but I also say he stopped short in pointing out how the west failed Russia.

Now, reading between the lines, I see Putin's statement as a possible precursor to justify some action Russia may take against the world. The Nazi's had a similar claim against the French after the first world war before rolling over France in a blitzkrieg.

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window.

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

>Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

>Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

>Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

>Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

>Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.

"17787","1460754241","The UK Government responded:

The accusations made about the Government and Prime Minister in this petition are wrong, and the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means no Government can call an early general election any more anyway.

The Government and Prime Minister have never sought to mislead the public. Nonetheless, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which came into force in 2011 under the Coalition Government, removed the power to set the general election date, and therefore to call an early general election, from the Government and gave a power to the House of Commons to call an early general election in certain circumstances.

An early general election can only be called under the Act if either a motion (as worded in section 2(2) of the Act) that there shall be an early parliamentary general election is passed by the House of Commons with at least two thirds in favour of the motion; or if a motion of no confidence (as worded in section 2(4) of the Act) is passed by the House of Commons and the House does not pass a motion of confidence (as worded in section 2(5) of the Act) in the Government or an alternative Government within 14 days. Aside from these triggers there is no way to replace the Government through an early General Election.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.  She doesn't need to go to jail.. they need to revoke her clearance and boot her ass out of any position of responsibility.","Reddit",142,0.5,13,20.61538462,1.473880597,1519,1198,13.17152698,61.22008611,9.932095293,9.047806621,9,9,9.841791045,9.421641791,9.599679482,12.84615385,7,9,12.23096164,5,264,0.018939394,0.153846154,0.461538462,1.076923077,0.307692308,0.153846154,0.230769231,0.384615385,0.153846154,0.461538462,0.153846154,1.538461538,0.692307692,1.769230769

>CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Coloradoƒ__s Democratic nominating process:
ƒ__Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Coloradoƒ__s Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturdayƒ__s 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.ƒ_

Typically, members of the U.S. government (and certainly members of the State Department) refer publicly to the land some refer to* as Palestine as ""occupied territories"" and not ""Palestine."" This phrasing represents the official U.S. policy on the issue. (Short read:  Those who refer to the area publicly as ""Palestine"" do not represent the official current U.S. stance.

The US tax situation is messed up. I've now filed Dutch, French and US tax returns and the US one is by far the most effort.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

  We Want An End To The Robbery
  By The Capitalists Of Our Black Community.


That's point number three of the Ten-Points Program, a manifesto written by Black Panther founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. I don't know how much more direct you can make it.

The Black Panthers were Marxists, students of a school of conflict sociology. AnCaps and other neoliberals will characterize an essential conflict in government vs. private interest, but that is not, precisely, fundamental to the Marxist conceit. Rather, the essential conflict is class based, with capitalism being the most recent development in exploitation. For Marxists like the Black Panthers, racism is not just some kind of hateful whimsy that only becomes violently destructive when the government jackboots get in on it. Rather, it is itself a product of capitalist self-interest. 

You've heard of how ""workers must seize the means of production,"" right? In chattel slavery, such as was practiced in the American South, the workers are indistinguishable from the means of production; they're owned as property in exactly the same commodified manner as a plantation field or a cotton 'gin. Racist exclusion was no less useful for maintaining an exploitable underclass after the civil war, either. For example, the prisoner leasing programs provided slaves-in-all-but-name as a direct byproduct of racist belligerence among law enforcement. The draft during the Vietnam War press-ganged thousands of young men to fight the enemies of capitalism, but passed over people who were in university, which, generally speaking, did not include a lot of black people. Finally, because obviously there are also plenty of working-class white people, racism is a method of division which foils any effective anti-capitalist sentiment by stirring up proletariat infighting.

Pursuant to the last point, I'll also note that, as time went on, the Panters curved away from Black Nationalism and into Revolutionary Internationalism. Yes, the Black Panthers were anti-establishment, but not because they were merely laissez-faire. They were anti-establishment because, in their opinion, the establishment in question was a longstanding edifice of capitalist values. The answer, for them, is not to simply open up a power vacuum where that government stood, if it just means that the consolidated power of the bourgeois withstands the move to ""anarchy"" and starts cutting deals to trade food to people in return for their eternal bondage. That's just a regression. Rather, to the Black Panthers (and other Marxist groups), the answer is solidarity among the exploited class and opposition to the ideologies which created a class disparity, of which racial disparity is only one kind. That doesn't mean you don't have a government. For many, it means you run one.

So, to answer your question:


  Why don't black people embrace anarcho-capitalism when it would encourage groups like the Black Panthers?


Because the only way an anarcho-capitalist encourages an actual Black Panther is by provoking him.

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.

> HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislatureƒ__or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didnƒ__t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this wasƒ__this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](

> Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

> However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

> If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. Thereƒ__s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

> So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else.","Reddit",219,0.43006263,22,21.77272727,1.592901879,2735,2185,16.30825584,49.97618286,10.94143671,9.661734041,10,13,11.69760581,9.728601253,9.965850782,15.02272727,8,11,14.74771314,5,461,0.030368764,0.095238095,-0.19047619,0.19047619,0.523809524,0.476190476,0.142857143,0.857142857,0.142857143,0.428571429,0.380952381,1.19047619,1,1.19047619

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

Which basically admits that Iran runs Iraq now. This is unsurprising given that Iraq is run by shities (who are also a majority in Iran) but it also means that the sunnis there have *zero* incentive to cooperate. Which is why many are joining ISIS, because it's their only alternative.

Over a decade of war in Iraq, just to have everyone come to the conclusion that it should be a satellite state of Iran, in perpetual war with the northern half of the country.","Reddit",76,0.678899083,5,21.8,1.458715596,609,482,13.4906422,61.30066055,10.29770642,8.842793233,9,9,10.12484404,8.990825688,9.818350167,13.5,7,9,12.34062658,5,107,0.037383178,0.2,0.2,0.4,0,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,0.8,1.2

If you have a home loan and you miss a $1000 payment are you in debt $1000 or in debt for whatever the value of the house is?

Most of the commly cited govt debt ,18 trillion or so, is like past due bills where we have to borrow more to pay its compounding interest.

I hope most people would think they are on the hook for the entire sum they promised to pay not just what is due today or tomorrow or.... 

On a side note. An average home loan is quite a long term relative to the life an average mortgage holder has left. So long term accounting should seem natural, else everyone would be defaulting on their home loans...

"531","1460682897","Barring a miracle or an indictment, Clinton's going to get the nomination. I have to accept this, because there's no way in hell the DNC is going to have it any other way. 

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

But they're next, and -- to mix a metaphor -- Clinton's weak showing is the canary in the coal mine.","Reddit",182,0.597269625,20,14.65,1.42662116,1643,1295,9.546006826,71.27309983,6.712235495,8.167326684,9,7,6.957629693,9.300341297,8.04673847,7.725,5,7,9.888512548,5,283,0.017667845,-0.555555556,-0.222222222,0.333333333,0.555555556,0.5,0.444444444,0.666666667,0.444444444,0.5,0.555555556,0.555555556,0.833333333,1.166666667

Instead of going out of the way to spend all of that money and energy on noise generators, she should have already released them.

The rebates given in tax credits are paid for from the tax base which we all pay into, so if everyone did it, the increase of taxes would be much greater than our dirt cheap fossil fuels right now.  The pollutants generated from the mass manufacture of solar panels can also be pretty nasty and harmful to the environment, though it's getting better all the time. 

Additionally, the fundamental piece missing from renewables is you can't control them to work when you want.  In a 100% renewable generation profile, where will your power come from in the middle of the night when the wind isn't blowing. You can't make it blow, and can't make the sun shine.

The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes.","Reddit",227,0.5,33,13.15151515,1.437788018,2465,1927,9.500237397,71.84934576,6.058591677,8.056555203,9,7,6.504989527,9.35483871,7.641592726,6.96969697,4,6,9.873865917,5,418,0.004784689,-0.433333333,-0.066666667,0.033333333,0.433333333,0.566666667,0.166666667,0.266666667,0.433333333,0.333333333,0.233333333,0.6,0.7,0.733333333

Civil disobedience is performing an illegal action, not only as a protest, but in order to be arrested and force courts to confront the injustice of the law. This is what led to sit-ins in segregated businesses. It is not the sitting that is the protest, it is being in a place where it is illegal to be in order to protest said illegality.

Sitting in front of Congress to protest corruption simply makes no sense. Do something that is connected, like underpay your taxes by whatever portion goes towards your representative's paycheck. Don't just break some random law, then act indignant when you are arrested. Break a law related to what you are protesting!","Reddit",88,0.631578947,8,16.625,1.556390977,762,612,12.96578947,58.28994831,8.555582707,9.475669509,10,10,9.259163534,10.07518797,8.746427842,10.9375,7,9,12.38480682,5,131,0,-2.75,-1.375,-0.875,1.125,0,0.875,0.625,0,0.375,0.25,0.625,1.375,0.5

"17578","1460091888","As user4012 has pointed out, the use of plurality voting in most election has led to a rigid two-party system.  This observation is called Duverger's Law.

Since the collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850's, every US president has been either a Democrat or a Republican.

There are a few ƒ__third partiesƒ_ on the ballot in a majority of the states: The Libertarians, the Greens, and the Constitution Party.  But they typically receive less than 4% of the vote combined.

There have, however, been times in the past when third parties have done better:


The Populists got 8.5% of the popular vote in the 1892 presidential election, and went on to win some governorships and Congressional seats.
The Progressives came in second in the 1912 presidential election as Theodore Roosevelt (formerly a Republican) made a run for a third term.  They did succeed in electing a California governor and some other state and local offices.
The Dixiecrats won a few Southern states in 1948.

The reason I ask is that Democracy Spring is happening in the U.S., and it seems to focus on addressing the problem through direct litigation. The problem could better be addressed by fixing our voting system (we currently have the very bad Plurality voting system) that I hypothesize to be especially manipulable by advertising and media.

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that weƒ__re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that heƒ__s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

The sight lines were awful from where most of the people got in, stuck behind out of view from the media and VIP bleachers (on the other side of the fountain). Honestly kind of a bummer about that, they should have set up a screen or something.

Edit: [A pic of the view (and a dude in an awesome Bernie jumpsuit)]( It would have been so much cooler if they put the stage on top where the fountain was and did it 360 style.

"6000","1460473907","There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

This whole scheme - including this very article - seems geared toward privatizing education via ""charter schools"" - basically private schools using public dollars, the holy grail of crony capitalism.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts.

>""No, I won't release the transcripts, and here's why. **Bernie Sanders doesn't care what I said**. Not one bit. He hates that I made the speeches. He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

>After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

>No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

Yes, it's condescending. Yes,  it's denying some people what they want. But I don't see how her obvious lie and dodge is benefiting her, particularly as she has to repeat it over and over. Just own that you made a great living giving speeches, like frickin Alan Thicke does, and that your private work will remain private.

In the 2004 election year I ran into two people offering to register people to vote next to the bus stop at my community college. I overheard one of them said, ""Now, you have to register as a member of a party otherwise you can't vote, and all I have are Republican forms-you can always change parties later."" I pretended not to be registered and looked over the form and sure enough ""Republican"" was checked off on all of the forms in their possession. I told them then that I was already registered as an independent, that party affiliation was NOT required to vote and that these people were obviously lying, and I said it loudly enough that everyone around could hear me. They got up and walked away immediately. I found a campus security officer close by and told them that the people were scamming students and they told me there was nothing they could or would do about it.

"1007","1460711369","Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

EU laws grant that nationals of EU countries have the right of residence in other EU countries. This is not a ""free for all"" right, though; after a few months of residence they have to show they have a way to sustain themselves (v.g. a work) or may be deported.

People who are not national of EU countries(the usual expression is third country national) are covered by the Schengen agreement. The Schengen Treaty led to the abolition of internal borders between the signatories. When a third country national is granted a Schengen visa (by any country in the agreement), the visa is 1 valid to visit all of the Schengen countries (although you are supposed to apply to the country at which you will be staying more). In exchange, there is a common policy for issuing such visas2 and the information of applicants is shared between the Schengen states3.

The question is that the UK (and Ireland) got an opt-out of the Schengen agreements, that allowed them to be part of the EU and not of the Schengen Treatry. So in the UK, for third party nationals, visas issued under the Schengen Treatry are not valid.

So, the rules for allowing third party nationals inside the UK are already under control of the UK government, either by specifying for each third party national which ones are free to enter without visa, which ones can enter with  certain visas4, and which are the requirements to get an UK issued visa.

cause the government
A couple of links:





What does European Union &quot;freedom of movement&quot; mean, and how much can individual countries restrict intra-EU immigration? (this is about the EU nationals).

1 Or should be, as some national legislations fail to fully comply with the Schengen agreement.

2 Due to the refugee crisis there has been some talks to create just a single entity for issuing Schengen visas, but at the time of writting there is not a solid initiative towards that.

3 IIRC some states might still issue ""national"" visas that are valid for their territory but not for any other country; but I am not fully sure about that.

4 As Bregalad points, there is at least one situation in which the UK allows entry with a visa issued by another country; it looks like Indian and Chinese nationals may enter the UK using some visas issues by Ireland (and viceversa). However, the treaty governing this is not related at all to the Schengen Treaty or to the UK being a member of the EU.

This is rhetorical - they don't.

But, if I was a Sanders supporter, I'd be posting this stuff, too.  Metrics that are actually predictive of outcomes are not favorable to Bernie.

Or why Sanders supporters try to pretend super delegates are stealing the election instead of acknowledging Clinton's 2.5 million vote lead in popular voting.

[The reality is that Sanders' odds are about 8% to win the nom.](  They are much lower in the general.  The reality is that Clinton is the heavy favorite in the election.  [She is a 70% favorite, whereas Sanders registers a humiliating 4%.](

Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA prior to her presidential campaign in 2008.  

So yes, Hillary Clinton has a history of supporting both the Iraq war and trade agreements.  

The ""millions of jobs"" is a political exaggeration.  Even strong advocates of that position put the number at less than a million.  Note that there have been extended periods of low unemployment after each trade agreement which suggests that regardless of magnitude, the economy's ability to create jobs outweighs the negative effects of trade agreements.  All this has been somewhat complicated by a long term trend away from manufacturing jobs in favor of automation.  And of course they don't measure additional jobs created by the monetary effects of low inflation.

This is the beginning of the exchange, though it expands further:

> **Filler:** So, New York and Long Island don't just lead the country in property taxes, that's not our only calling card. We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

> **Clinton:** Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-Çÿ-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime.

Considering a good part of the anti-Hillary jib is how interventionist she is, it's downright hilarious that people are making this an issue. 

The Honduran military ousted a would-be dictator on the orders of the Honduran Supreme Court. So... bluntly, get the fuck out of here with this bullshit. What, should we have stepped in to help him become El Presidente for life? Is being more hands-off on Latin American affairs than any Presidential administration in living memory a *bad* thing now?

The harsh reality is, with our voting system, the only candidate that can beat the republican is the democrat. So if you don't vote for the democrat, you're not helping to defeat the republican. I say this as someone who agrees more with the green party's platform than the democratic party's platform. I'd love to vote green, but I'll only do so if it will actually accomplish something! Being principled and voting your conscience are only things that you do to make yourself feel good. I know nobody likes to be told how to vote, but in my opinion, the most noble thing to do is vote with the idea of civic duty in mind, and cast the vote that's going to do the most good for the country.

I'm really pulling for Bernie, and I've given him a lot of money and volunteered my time phone banking for him. But if Hillary ends up being the democratic nominee, you bet your ass I'll be sucking it up and casting my vote for her.

This country needs to be defended from Trump, Cruz, or whatever other extremist the republicans nominate.

Far better to take stock of the situation and to target campaign resources based on the reality rather than presuming the nomination will be won.

Volunteers on the ground need to be motivated and spurred on - telling them that the job is done has no benefit. Telling them where to go and who to target - that can swing the campaign on the ground.

Assuming the candidate doesn't drop out on her or his own:

The delegates have complete control over the convention.  They could vote in a rule prior to the nomination vote that said that the candidate was not eligible and vote in someone else.  Many of them may still be bound to vote for that candidate, but the rules would say that the candidate could not win.  There is no rule saying explicitly that having enough bound delegates to make up a majority of the delegates awards victory.  

For example, if Hillary Clinton is convicted of abuse of classified information after winning 2383 bound delegates in primaries, her own delegates could vote in a rule precluding anyone convicted of a felony from winning the nomination.  They'd be bound to vote for her on the first ballot but that wouldn't count.  Most would be unbound on later ballots and could vote for someone else.  That someone else might be Bernie Sanders but not necessarily.  They could pick someone else entirely.  

To continue, Clinton could then turn state's evidence against Donald Trump on a bribery charge.  Trump gets convicted too but has at least 1237 bound delegates.  The Republican delegates modify rule 40 to exclude votes for convicted felons.  Some of the delegates may be unbound immediately, e.g. Minnesota and Oklahoma are only bound if the candidate is nominated.  Cruz, Kasich, or some other candidate could be nominated.  

Note:  neither scenario is likely.  This is just a semi-realistic chain of events to illustrate what could happen.  

All that said, if either party did this, they'd need a really good reason to avoid a backlash.  They'd probably try hard to get a unanimous decision on the rule change so as to provide cover against charges of interfering with the election.  They'd specifically try to recruit the previous supporters of the candidate to be removed.

Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.

"2958","1460625392","So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else.

>>[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

>>Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

First: It is not ""8 for girls, 14 for boys""; It is 15 for boys and 9 for girls (Lunar year).
Second: It is not true that ""only Iran and Saudi Arabia use this law"", So is Yemen, I believe.
third: In Iran, although age of majority is 15 for boys and 9 for girls, but this is for Religious obligations, such as Lent. For social activities like driving licence, elections,... the age is 18 for both girls and boys.  

Now the answer for your question:
The answer is in your question: ""this is due to sharia law."" 


  Note that the government in most of countries with majority of Muslim people are secular, e.g Turkey, or secular in some parts e.g Syria. Maybe it is a surprise for some people when they hear  Political forms of Islam are not tolerated by the government in Syria. (Syria has separate secular and religious courts. Civil and criminal cases are heard in secular courts, while the Sharia courts handle personal, family, and religious matters in cases between Muslims or between Muslims and non-Muslims. Non-Muslim communities have their own religious courts using their own religious law)
   So they dont apply ""sharia law"".

In Kollam district of Kerala state Kollam Hindu Temple Fireworks Blast incident took place in which More than 100 people were died. Few days before of incident taking  place, district collector and the district police commissioner of Kollam district refused permission for cracking of Fireworks . But as these 2 officer were Muslims and festival was of Hindus, some people and politicians gave it a communal color and demanded for dismissal of these 2 officer. People done celebrations with Fireworks and the bad incident took place.
In the 2nd incident where the Hindu devotee woman wanted to enter inside the core of the  another Hindu temple named as Mahalaxmi Temple in Kolhapur district of Maharashtra state for praying .But temple administration refused to permit her as they think that it is against Hindu culture. But with the Court's order the district collector and district police commissioner of Kolhapur district helped her to get inside the core of the temple.  But while entering the core of the temple the Hindu woman devotee was badly beaten by the people . Here,both these officers are from Hindu religion who helped that Hindu devotee to enter inside the Hindu temple. But after that some people as well as politicians are demanding dismissal of both district collector and district police commissioner. 


Here,as a bystander I really don't understand how to summarise the religion based Indian politics from these 2 incidents. What conclusion can be drawn from it? Also,How can the religious conflict be minimized in India like secular country to maintain the peace and amity?

Hillary Clinton reads a script that includes her direct involvement in the ""CP time"" joke, and decides that is a good idea. After being called out on it she does not apologize, and also shifts the blame to de Blasio.

Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do.

A petition cannot possibly force early elections. It could sway Parliament, but if the Tories stay united and don't want a dissolution then there will be no dissolution. The Queen used to have the power to dissolve Parliament, and could theoretically do it against the advice of the PM if she wanted to cause a constitutional crisis (Canada and Australia both saw uses of reserve powers in the 20th century, and both were very controversial); however, this is no longer possible after the FTPA. The Queen still has the power to dismiss the PM and appoint a new one, but again, this is a theoretical power more than a real one.

1- Yousef Yemen 's map is more accurate.

2- They are not allies but they have common interests. Some of common interests:
(i) Iran suffers US hostility which results UN sanctions. Russia can help Iran in the case: 1- Russia can soften severity of sanctions. 2- Iran need to have some technologies (e.g. atomic reactors) that only can deal with Russia in the absence of US (and Consequently EU). In this deal Russia, also, have many benefits. A big market with no rivals.
(ii) Iran and Syrian Government have cooperation against Israel. Russia has naval facility in Tartus. Both Iran and Russia are cautious about changing regime. I believe both want the change be gradual and the new regime were not US ally.
(iii) As Yousef Yemen says Soviet Union suffered very heavy losses from terrorist (which are Sunni Wahhabi). Usually Shiites dont Commit self-willed actions, because they believe that any fight must be with order of top religious scholar. Almost all Shiites top religious scholars knows killing people  against ""Sharia"". This even include infidels until they start fight with Muslims or occupy their land (today only fight with Israel is legal by this sentence). Spreading Shiites thought can help Russia in this case.  

3- It is not true that ""Putin together with Shiites is fighting against Sunnites"".
The problem here, for Iran, is Israel. Iran knows Israel as enemy, as I explained in 2(iii). Then Iran is friend of all Muslims that are against Israel in the scope of Sharia. So Iran support both Hezbollah (Shiite) and Hamas (Sunni). 

4- Sunni Arabs make up the largest population group in Syria. Bashar al-Assad 's Religion is Alawite and he rules as secular.

  However, I can't find where the states are actually required to have a legislature in the first place, and what qualifies as a ""legislature"" (are democratic elections required?). Where is this specified?


It isn't specified.  Whether or not a democratic election is required is largely untested, although the ""One Person One Vote"" principle implies democratic elections are required based on Section 2 of the 14th amendment.  Section 4 of Article IV of the constitution says that it must be a republican government.  

There was a recent Supreme Court decision that allowed states to delegate redistricting power to a commission, even though that is supposed to be a power of the state legislature.  Under that theory, any law making assembly would be sufficient if it is part of a republican government.

There are a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters who have intelligent and nuanced views on politics, and an understanding of the bigger picture at play. However, in my experience, these folks tend to have already been politically engaged, and are supporting Sanders because he best matches up with their viewpoint. 

A large percentage of the new people he's picked up, however, seem to be of the ""Bern or Bust"" model; it seems foolhardy to count on much of a long-term revival from his candidacy.

"6005","1460489706","For those of you who are genuinely interested on Clinton's position on standardized testing, she sat down with the Editorial Board of Newsday (Newsday is the major Long Island, New York paper and the center of opposition to standardized testing in New York is Long Island) yesterday and gave a lengthy answer on the subject as well as answering several follow-ups.



Newsday's website is subscription only, but I will post as much as I think I safely can under the doctrine of fair use:

>Filler: So, New York and Long Island don't just lead the country in property taxes, that's not our only calling card. We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

>Clinton: Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-Çÿ-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime. It was very upsetting to everybody.

>Filler:So you wouldn't say don't do it, you would say do it right.

>Clinton:Do it right. Do it right and I would say I think we need better and fewer tests that are used for what tests should be used for, first and foremost as to how to improve the educational outcomes for individual children, for classes of children, and for schools of children.

>Filler: Should they be used at all to determine whether teachers are being successful?

>Clinton: I think given the state of where testing is right now, I don't think they're good enough to make that determination.","Reddit",258,0.448275862,33,16.6969697,1.430127042,3044,2411,10.59893307,68.89882803,7.527940384,8.155533738,9,9,7.797317274,9.328493648,8.547549711,8.984848485,5,8,10.43686959,5,522,0.013409962,0.703703704,0.62962963,0.703703704,0.111111111,0.407407407,0.074074074,0.074074074,0.185185185,0.148148148,0.037037037,0.592592593,0.259259259,0.962962963

Bernie honeymooning in the USSR.

Bernie in Cuba supporting Castro.

(ƒ__The people we met had an almost religious affection for [Fidel Castro]. The revolution there is far deep and more profound than I understood it to be. It really is a revolution in terms of values.ƒ_)

Bernie supporting the Sandinistas.

Bernie talking about how we don't need so many different brands of food to buy.


Closing tag.  ""Bernie Sanders.  Not that kind of socialist?  You tell me.""


Reddit has a hard time understanding how people could support Hillary.  Because Bernie is too far left even for the majority of Democrats (this is why he's losing) and because in the one area that a Democrat president will have control in with a Republican congress--foreign policy--Bernie is either clueless or dangerous.  

EDIT:  Downvotes don't make any of this less true Bernie-bots.  These things happened and these things are why he'll never be president.

>The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honorƒ__the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

"17770","1460709340","FiveThirtyEight did a reasonably good job of analyzing this for the bound delegates.  It doesn't really cover the unbound delegates.  

I'm not going to repeat the analysis they give there.  It is certainly possible for Trump to make it to 1237 purely with bound delegates.  He would need to win 479 of the 744 remaining or 64%.  But their analyses suggests that he will fall about 80 short.  Assuming that there are about 200 unbound delegates on the first ballot, he would therefore need about 40% of them to make a majority.  

So Trump either needs to outperform their expectations by about 20% or he needs to convert enough unbound delegates to make up the difference.  

New York is an instructive example.  538's path to 1237 has Trump winning 91 of 95 delegates from New York.  But if he finishes third (or second with the first place finisher over 50%) in one district and second in another, he'd get 0 of 3 and 1 of 3 respectively.  That would take him down to 90.  Even if he finishes first in five districts but below the 50% mark, he'd only get 2 of 3 delegates in each district and fall short.  Polls show Trump with 50% to 60% of the vote statewide, averaging about 54%.  At 60% he might have enough to make 50% in each district, but at 50% he almost certainly wouldn't.  If he falls short of 91 delegates in New York, he'll have to make up those delegates elsewhere.  

I haven't seen congressional district level polls of Trump support, even though that would be what's needed to predict his vote totals in New York and other states that award delegates by congressional district results.  Most projections are going to be somewhat weak without that kind of data.  

I saw on the news today that the Trump campaign is currently projecting themselves at 1265 bound delegates.  This remains possible.  It is certainly much more likely than that Cruz will pass Trump before the convention.  But it's a steep climb.  

I don't see how Trump can expect to get more than a 100 unbound delegates on the first ballot.  That would mean that he needs at least 1137 bound delegates.  And that may give him more support than he really has.  He tends to do worse in conventions and other circumstances where people can't vote for him directly.  He might well find himself stuck at 60 unbound delegates.  That would mean that he needs 1177 bound delegates.  That's about 20 delegates ahead of the 538 projection.  

You may hear a lot of talk about rule 40b.  Most of it is rather confused.  First, Cruz has won a majority of the delegates in seven states already:  Texas; Kansas; Maine; Idaho; Utah; Wisconsin; Colorado.  He also will likely get the vote of a majority of the Louisiana delegates (having signed all ten of the unbound delegates) and seems well poised for victory in Wyoming.  Either would allow him to met the requirement.  

Second, rule 40b doesn't prevent votes for any candidates.  It prevents them from receiving floor nominations where they get to talk on television (as covered in 40c) and from having their names read in the vote count (rule 40d).  In 2012, Ron Paul was short of the eight states but he still received 190 of the first ballot votes.  While Kasich, Cruz, and other potential candidates may appreciate getting to talk on television, they won't need to talk on television to reach delegates.  They can talk to delegates directly.  

In terms of other rules, I wouldn't expect them to have much effect either.  The rules committee won't want to give the appearance of changing the rules for this election.  In fact, I suspect that they won't want to give the impression of rules affecting the election in any way.  

Trump also has the problem that if he doesn't win on the first ballot, many of his delegates (and everyone else's) become unbound.  This is why many observers think that the first ballot is his best if not only chance to win the nomination.  If he can get to 1237 then, he wins.  If not, he probably doesn't.

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

> Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans arenƒ__t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

> Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

> If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if heƒ__s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they wonƒ__t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

> Donƒ__t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job. Let's not make ovaries a requirement of high office--just like we wouldn't make religion or race or whatever.

Sorry but when you are a president you are supposed to be the leader and others should follow you and not the other way around. This is something I miss in Hillary.

Another trait of a good leader is taking the blame when it is yours to take and not blame somebody else for the mistakes you made! Yesterday in debate you could clearly see she that she doesn't understand this (she solely blamed Obama for some mistakes she was as much responsible for.

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

He literally brings up how he's going to pay for his proposals in *every single debate*. Clinton? Not so much. ""Closing loopholes"". Well, okay. This is exactly the answer that Romney gave to Obama during the 2012 debates on how his plans wouldn't effect the revenue in a negative way.

When trusts were broken up by the courts under the Sherman Act, correct me if I'm wrong, the companies did the restructuring themselves. His answer was totally spot on, the Federal government says ""that's enough power for you"", not ""here is how we're going to internally change your company"".

Even when a petition reaches the required number of signatures, the petition committee of the parliament will only consider putting it up for debate in parliament. 
Being put up for debate means just that: the parliament will have a discussion about it, nothing more. It does not mean that any MP will consider turning it into a proper act to vote on. 
And even when someone decides to do that, the parliament will vote on it as usual and can decide to dismiss it.


By the way, demanding a new general election because people are unhappy with the prime minister does not make much sense, because the prime minister is not elected by the general public. The general public vote the members of the parliament and then the parliament decides who becomes prime minister (technically the monarch decides, but practically they always pick the one the parliament wants). So when the UK public wants a new prime minister, they should petition the parliament to ask the queen to appoint someone else. A reelection does not necessarily reach that goal because the new parliament could just pick the same prime minister again.

The real crime is that anyone listens to anything any Democrat has to say on firearms and firearms policy. As a matter of course, the standard assumption is that everything they say is dishonest or at best a half-truth. Sadly, this is not a hyperbolic statement or exaggeration in any way. Which is especially frustrating because there are so many very knowledgeable people who know law, Constitution, research studies, and history, who can accurately discuss public policy and even societal root causes. Heck, a huge number of laymen know the subject matter far, far better than most Democrats attempting to make public policy and law. Take time to ponder that.

To give you an idea of how completely backwards political arena is on firearms, consider the following. When people want expert opinion, they go to experts. When Democrats want expert opinion on firearms and policy, they go to politicians. Which is painfully obvious why, as the experts contradict just about everything Democrat politicians have to say on the subject. Which brings us full circle to my opening sentence.

Longitude (in degrees, minutes, seconds) east or west of a prime meridian (such as through the Greenwich Observatory)
A reference geoid or ellipsoid (such as NAD 83), or the use of local surveying relative to mountains or stars.


Sometimes the boundary is clarified by using a map projection (that is based on a reference ellipsoid like NAD 83 and a UTM zone definition), with units in feet or meters relative to the origin of the zone.  For example, the U.S. Supreme Court ratified such an ocean boundary (measured in meters, with a precision of 1 millimeter) between the United States and California.  Most of the ruling is a data dump from a GIS system.

In many U.S. states, property boundaries are defined using chains of offsets.  Each offset is measured in feet (often to a precision of 0.01 feet), with an angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds.

She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

Not only did it screw my credit, I only found out about it cause when I tried to get my first cell phone (this was in 2001 so cells were just finally going mainstream), Sprint wouldn't let me hey one cause they said I owed them $450 about in long distance phone calls to Mexico.

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me.

"2521","1460647105","As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result.","Reddit",214,0.524421594,21,18.52380952,1.401028278,2121,1676,11.00849553,69.50634105,8.12486106,7.935181826,9,9,8.16641939,8.894601542,8.933617622,10.92857143,5,8,10.50422373,5,384,0,1.15,0.35,0.9,0.2,0.55,0.2,0.25,0.55,0.4,0.45,0.85,0.5,1.4

"17680","1460408854","The restriction on the president of Pakistan is set forth in the contituion of Pakistan. The answer to your question depends on how the government of Pakistan reads the phrase ""two consecutive terms"". This can be read to mean that after two terms (10 years), the President must allow someone else to serve for one term (similar to the way Grover Cleveland was President of the United States for two nonconsecutive terms). It can also be read to mean that he is forbidden to serve as President again after a period that would constitute two consecutive terms (10 years), similar to the way a President of the United States cannot serve for more than 10 years as President even if they are not consecutive. Note that the United States allows for the case of a Vice President filling out the term of a deceased president and then being elected for two terms on his own.


  44    Term of office of President.
  (1)   Subject to the Constitution, the
  President shall hold office for a term of five years from the day he
  enters upon his office:
  
  Provided that the President shall, notwithstanding the expiration of his
  term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office. 
  
  (2)   Subject to the Constitution, a person holding office as
  President shall be eligible for re-election to that office, but no
  person shall hold that office for more than two consecutive terms.  
  
  (3)   The President may, by writing under his hand addressed to the
  Speaker of the National Assembly, resign his office.

To accept the results of Arizona and only move to correct the issue for the general is having your cake and eating it too. 

If you can justify a lawsuit here (which you can) than throwing out the results of Arizona's primary is equally justifiable. 

To accept the results when it benefits them (Hillary and DNC) and then move to correct it for when the law won't benefit them (the general) they are spitting in the face of every disenfranchised voter in the primary.

Violence against the police only makes people STOP liking you.  You can get your message heard these days, thanks to mass media and social media, so easily.

Seriously, if any of you are planning on protesting, do it peacefully.

As soon as you start blocking ambulances and throwing stuff at police, I instantly think you are a scummy person of low intellectual capacity.

Seriously, think about it for a second, what does blocking an ambulance on the street actually do.  What is the purpose of your protest.  Do you think people are going to become enlightened to your message and flock to you and be inspired by you by doing that?  Now, I assume most of you reading this are reasonably intelligent people to agree with this idea that ya, that is dumb.
