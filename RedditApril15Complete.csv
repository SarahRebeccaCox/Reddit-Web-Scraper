"112",1460712225,"They should have never let off of this, and I'm glad it came up at the debate.

She has had months to address this. No Democratic candidate should be able to deflect with ""I'll do it when the Republicans do it."" 

They're not the ones saying they support campaign finance reform, you are Hillary."
"113",1460715858,"In regards to her speaking fees it would be nice for her supporters to at least admit there is a potential conflict of interest instead of acting like money influencing politics is an alien concept when it's come to the democrats."
"114",1460716358,"Just watch her avoid it on last nights debate. Even if I supported her, I would feel dirty watching that display. It there is not a pile of incriminating statements in that speech she is absolutely insane for acting like this. You need a big imagination to find any gray area. "
"115",1460713722,"The pressure will fade away, unless Bernie Sanders directly mentions it again, instead of through twitter or something"
"116",1460724290,"Hillary's campaign was the first to make an issue of demanding president Obama's birth certificate. That bogus issue has dogged Obama for 8 years since.  Now she is making a fake issue of Senator Sander's taxes. She is very good at assassination by innuendo."
"117",1460727513," What has she said in these speeches that scares her from releasing it.  I personally think she has criticised what ever little Obama has done about the banks as well as promised she will reverse it when she becomes president. That would destroy her candidacy as she has portrayed herself as someone that would take Obama's policies forward. And she has been on record saying that she wasn't planning to run for presidency when she gave those speeches."
"118",1460720807,"Ultimately I believe she needs to feel the pressure from the voters before she'll ever do this.  She doesn't give two shits about this press coverage, or hash tags, or websites unless she starts to truly lose and those losses can be linked it this. Yes he won recently but NY will likely go her way bc of the bullshit closed primary and party affiliation change deadline. I keep reading that she's pressured and she seemed pissed last night at times but a NY win will chill her out quick. I hope I wrong about NY but I got too emotional after IL and FL to not be cautious. 

Further, it would have to be true desperation bc it seems like there's some BAD shit in there since they haven't been released yet. 

I'd put the liklihood that we ever see these at the same odds as my 7 year old declaring she's over Mac and Cheese. Basically zero. "
"119",1460722558,"I kind of like Hillary - but why the Democratic Party allowed her to run and then backed her so strongly is beyond me. I would really like to see a women president but gender is secondary to merits. So much smoke ..."
"120",1460728258,"*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton’s decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "
"121",1460720511,"There are lots of things the Republicans haven't done yet, like embrace same sex marriage. 

If Clinton wanted to use Republicans as a reason not to get into something or do something, she could still hold her true beliefs that gays should not marry and just play it off like Republicans haven't done it yet. "
"122",1460729690,"#therearenotranscripts

It makes me sad that a few years ago I rolled my eyes at anyone who said ""liberal media"" and acted as if they had influence over elections or politics.. now I see.."
"128",1460729238,"Her whole ""Reasoning"" for not makes me nauseous. Your not running against the republican yet Hillary, stop pretending they have anything to do with the democratic fucking primary. You want to use that bullshit in the general then fine, then it might make some sense. "

"134",1460732316,"That growing political backlash has given her a devastating [15% lead](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/) in New York. "
"135",1460732430,"To be fair, and I'm not a Hilary fan at all, but to be fair, that's how things work in Washington. Literally, how things work. You compromise and wheedle and make get indebted to folks and they give you money and you that's how you get elected. Bernie is a crazy, weird unicorn. A Socialist independent. From Vermont. Who's unbeholden like Bernie? He's weird. A freak. From Mars. 

So yeah, I think he's right to say that she's got puppet strings. But I also think it's right of Hillary to say that her puppet strings aren't any different than the Republican candidates -- and in fact, probably less noxious, but she doesn't want to put hers on display, because the Republican super-pacs will run with that in the general, and she doesn't need any more Negatives. 

I'm calling this: Both Right. "
"136",1460732894,"What is political pressure?

She resisted FBI after violated National Security."
"137",1460733092,"If her party wants to win the presidency and get all those cushy jobs and offices - they need Bernie Sanders."
"138",1460733282,"I didn't care about this at all at first, but the more I hear about it the more I am beginning to think there is something shady connected to it.  It was a lot of money for a speech, if the speech doesn't seem worth the money I can only suspect she was actually getting paid for something else under the guise of giving a speech."
"139",1460733323,"Is it possible that some of these transcript might not exist? Didn't she do a lot of panel discussions and interviews in addition to speeches? I just wonder if anybody would've even thought to keep those. 

Sure one possibility is that she's being secretive, but sometimes I wonder that they can't produce them because they don't know where they are, and she might not have known that when she said the transcripts would be produced. "
"140",1460733429,"Finally, even they're seeing that Bernie has the bigger chance. It's all downHillary from here."
"141",1460733486,"Even her own news station "
"142",1460733568,"What's amazing to me is she had a chance to take a real leadership role and say ""I will be the first to do this and I challenge everyone else to do the same.""

(I mean, if it's really as innocuous as she claims)"
"143",1460730706,"she doesn't want to release them because she never gave them...

 

"
"144",1460725068,"The reality is their policy objectives are far closer to each other than they do holding a position of power."
"145",1460732044,"What if she *can't* release the transcripts? 

At first I thought it was probable that she'd said something innocuous-seeming but unethical. My working theory was that she'd told these groups of people that she was definitely running for president, which would have made the speaking fees FEC violations. But I decided last night, while she dodged this question multiple times, that maybe it's something else. 

Maybe those transcripts were stored on her private server along with the rest of the Clinton Foundation's documents. Maybe she can't release then because they're currently part of the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which is just one of the investigations currently underway. And if they are, then she can't really say ""Well I'd be happy to give them to you as soon as the FBI lets me.""

This is an unfounded theory with no evidence, obviously. Just thinking out loud here. But what if that's why?"
"146",1460732073,"Damn...where's that pitchfork emporium guy when you need him?? I really feel like joining a good ole fashioned angry mob right about now! "
"147",1460732487,"I was really surprised Bernie didn't hammer her to release the transcripts, the obvious fact is that what was said in those speeches is so damning she has no choice but to not release them.  She cannot release the transcripts because it will sink her campaign over night and she and her advisors know this.  Bernie should've accused her relentlessly of saying one thing behind closed doors and another to the public, he should've made her so uncomfortable she had no choice but to relent and release the speeches--they would be the death knell of her campaign, when people realize how cozy she is with the big banks they are going to flee her in droves.  "
"148",1460703310,"Bernie is that rarest of all creatures ..an honest politician whose net worth reflects the fact."
"149",1460705313,"I don't think she wants to agree with that this week. "
"150",1460727244,"Hillary is the poster child for the establishment.

If she doesn't think she is part of it, I'd like to know who she thinks is part of the establishment."
"151",1460718182,"If she could only admit she's establishment and move on. I mean, some people like the establishment. They like her experience^notthatshesaccomplishedmuch^butidigress but she just can't let it go. As a lifelong Democrat I'll vote for her in the general if I have to, but with these tryhard tendencies she is not going to make a good candidate. "
"152",1460723453,"Someone needs to write a satire article like the one that came out accusing sanders of trying to win the nomination. "
"153",1460703055,"hmm do you think Sanders sees every other person in Congress as part of the establishment except for himself?"
"154",1460732999,"I actually voted for Bernie, but he has been a Senator for... what, 25 years? It's not like he's really an outsider."
"155",1460704293,"I'm so confused. So if you are a Democrat or a Republican is it wrong to support the leadership of that party, which I assume the establishment is comprised of. "
"156",1460732971,"Bernie does say that tho. Legit if you disagree you're either bought off or in the establishment "
"157",1460732268,"Why the hell is she trying to push this idea that somehow she's not part of the establishment? She's Hillary fucking Clinton. It doesn't get more establishment than that!"
"158",1460729795,"She shouldn't deny being a member of the establishment, her base knows she is. Some people just don't want to change our current system, that's who is voting for her, she alienates them shenanigans she denies being establishment."
"159",1460725264,"I don't get this ""establishment"" argument. If you hold public office, you are a part of the ""establishment."" It's not a bad thing, deals and compromises are a part of the job. In my humble opinion, the only candidate who I would claim isn't a part of the ""establishment"" is Trump."
"160",1460729399,"Sanders, you have been in congress/senate for 20 years. You are also a member of the establishment."
"161",1460733472,"She's doing a piss-poor job of making it look like she isn't running on a victim-complex. 

Acting like any valid criticism is an attack is what thin-skinned people do; not candidates for POTUS."
"162",1460710727,"Classic MacGruber, l mean Sanders! 

I didn't see the debate yet, waiting on internet to be restored, but I hear it was pretty good fit Sanders, hope so. 

"
"163",1460727898,"I was hoping he would fire back using that on her immediately after what she said.. But the delivery was off and the timing was right in the middle of a big roar so I don't feel like it was as effective"
"164",1460731914,"this is my main problem with Senator Sanders.  I love his position on 99% of the issues, BUT from all the stories I read about and looking at his voting record and his poor record in getting bills passed (2 post offices renamed and a veterans bill), it seems that Bernie will not work with people who are not 100% in alignment with his way of thinking.  We are still dealing with Republicans deciding not to work with Democrats because they lost the election.  I really do not feel energized to see a candidate who only became a Democrat, so he could get the democrat money to run for President and who will not only be unable to work with Republicans but also unwilling to work with many democrats.   

I also do not see a problem with the word establishment and will be more than happy when this election is over and the word is retired.   Sanders has been in government for a long time and the only reason he is not ""establishment"" is because he refuses to work with people and get things done.   In every aspect of my life, I want to work with people who are established."
"165",1460732389,"Probs an unpopular opinion here considering the bubble, but that was one of Clinton's better moments from last night, she highlighted how difficult Sanders is to work with (something people like Barney Frank have said before) and how Sanders idealogical purity puts him at odds with would be allies. Even better for Clinton was that Sanders played right into it without realizing it.

&gt;""His holier-than-thou attitude - saying in a loud voice he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else - really undercuts his effectiveness,"" said Frank.
""To him, anybody who disagrees with him is a crook; there are no honest disagreements with people. Bernie's view of the world is that the great majority of people agree with him on all the issues and the only reason he does not win is that the Congress is crooked.""

"168",1460704275,"Bernie's been a Congress critter for 20 fucking years, sucking at the same budget teat as every other fuckface in the country. He passes his little amendments, gets pet projects for VT, sucks his rural gun-toting voters dicks, collects his $200K check and pisses it away on who knows what.

And then he wants to turn around and act like he's some saintly outsider.

Edit: Here's a nice piece of pork that the angelic Bernie fleeced taxpayers for so that he could keep his cushy job in the Senate.

Edit 3: I continue to get downvoted even though there are sources showing Bernie votes for military pork if it benefits him, that he perpetuates the military industrial complex, that he'll waste tax payer money if it means he gets to keep his $200k job for another 6 years. The brain washing in this sub/site is embarrassing."
"169",1460695167,"She was literally asked three times to address why she wouldn't release her transcripts and talked about completely unrelated topics everytime.

"170",1460690063,"She got booed several times during the debate. The transcripts was definitely the biggest one though.

What a coward..."
"173",1460691441,"I bet she didn't like the audience's tone."
"174",1460693057,"Clinton definitely used up more of Bernie's time trying to talk over him than he did hers. From the very beginning to the very end, she just kept talking past her allotted time. Bringing up more points. Bernie only kept talking past his allotted time so that he could finish his points. I also could not believe that on the topic of the Supreme Court nominations that Clinton brough up Roe v. Wade and what it is to be a woman and how women need rights. What the fuck did that have to do with the question? Nothing. This entire campaign she's been trying to convince people to vote for her just because she's a woman. It's ridiculous. I think that if we were actually scoring this debate that Bernie won."
"175",1460692245,"I for one, enjoyed Hilary showing her true condescending attitude when she was getting booed. Man.. Those times when she was giving viewers that *look*, fuck.. "
"176",1460695217,"At first I really wasn't a fan of this argument that she should release her transcripts because I really don't like the concept of ""Well if you have nothing to hide then you should ________"". 

But after having a couple of months to think about it, I think the real crux of the issue (which I don't see many people pressing) is that she made an active decision to accept payments from these organizations. She CREATED a conflict of interest. It was her decision. No one else made it for her. Politicians (universally) need to be transparent and disclose all potential conflicts of interest and this undoubtedly qualifies."
"177",1460690131,"Video? "
"178",1460691821,"She has a really hard time with this and questions about raising the cap on income tax. It's a circle, guys. She's paid off by white-collars flying private G6's via these speeches to promise to not raise the cap. She doesn't give a fuck about you unless you've put money in her pocket. If you can't see this you are blind. "
"179",1460688856,"This is a landslide effort for Bernie.
Hilary can not seriously present herself as someone with integrity."
"180",1460691417,"This debate thrilled me.  The final statements were stunning.  Sanders' final statement felt like history unfolding; that Hillary could not even begin to speak for several moments because of the chanting of Sanders' name, followed by her tepid plea for votes, was just a joy to watch.

What a time.  We could be watching serious history being made, right now."
"181",1460696103,"Heres the thing about Hillary. She isnt much worse than any other politician out there. *Everyone* is corrupt. And compared to a lot of the corrupt politicians, Hillary isnt too bad. Thats why she thinks she's justified in not releasing the transcripts. Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change. 

If I could give Hillary one piece of advice, it would be this: Forget about yourself, remember America."

Voters are realizing they're hearing the same shit over and over, and it's not a direct answer to the question. Whatever is on those transcript, if they exist at all, at this point doesn't even matter. The fact that she doesn't have a direct answer is a full display of a lack of integrity.

Politics aside, Hilary is a despicable human being. She is everything that's wrong with politics. She embodies all the negative connotation that people associate with the idea of ""the establishment"". I hope she continues to get expose and this effectively end her political career entirely. "

"190",1460729546,"Well we did know. But what Sanders has done here is highlighted it with a very large marker. So everyone can see.  He has given us a look behind the curtain and labeled all the knobs.

I don't understand where these arbitrary differences and categories come from. I fully understand that much of that is simply my ignorance of the complicated laws and regulations that govern this stuff, but at the end of the day I'm not sure that can account for the grave injustice our tax system currently delivers to the average person in this country."

Edit:  It seems like the most common defense is that guns are intended as a person killing device first. Others have pointed out that guns are used in many non-human-killing activities. I'll offer one thing further. Are guns designed to primarily kill people with malicious intent? If a gun manufacturer primarily makes their weapons as a product intended for defense of life and property, does that hurt the ""designed to kill people, therefore culpable"" argument?"
"202",1460698804,"Hillary talked about the NRA once spending money campaign against Bernie's opponent. You can read the article for the details, but the support was lukewarm for Bernie at best, and the NRA was more motivated by their soured relationship with his opponent.

So that money, 25+ years ago, that wasn't directly in support of Bernie, is evidence of his ""being a reliable supporter of the NRA."" But much bigger amounts of money, in this election cycle, given directly to Hillary campaign and her Super PAC, are not evidence of her being indebted to the fossil fuel industry.

If the group that you supposedly support regularly gives you a grade of ""D"" for supporting them, you aren't a reliable supporter.  You aren't even an *unreliable* supporter.  It would be hard to call you a supporter at all.

Call it what it is: Hillary took a few pro-gun lobby votes and twisted it to call Sanders a friend of the NRA.  I'm not what you would call a ""reliable supporter"" of Bernie Sanders, but she lied.  C'mon.  Call a spade a spade."

"245",1460707582,"  
Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-05-20/news/9102270272_1_nra-officials-brady-bill-powerful-gun).) And source [for votes... another politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/) titled **""Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases?""**, rated **mostly true**       
Again. It's Vermont, I doubt Sanders would have made it to the Senate if he voted against the aforementioned stuff.

No hate necessary, just respond what you think..

"301",1460703751,"As I posted in another thread,  Were I advising Hillary:

&gt;""No, I won't release the transcripts, and here's why. **Bernie Sanders doesn't care what I said**. Not one bit. He hates that I made the speeches. He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

Yes, it's condescending. Yes,  it's denying some people what they want. But I don't see how her obvious lie and dodge is benefiting her, particularly as she has to repeat it over and over. Just own that you made a great living giving speeches, like frickin Alan Thicke does, and that your private work will remain private. "

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it. 

If he wins the nomination and the presidency it will interesting to see how popular he is a year from now."

"322",1460703012,"You can almost understand what she is saying: *if a left-wing Dem congress put a $15 federal minimum wage bill on her desk*, she would sign it. But she doesn't believe the political will is there, so she won't advocate or fight for it, because that's not ""pragmatic"" or politically viable.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

The Clinton revolution was basically founded on ""New Dems"" newfound role as hippie punchers, so triangulating against a hippie is making Hillary sound increasingly schizophrenic."
"323",1460692526,"She looked so bad in this answer because it truly seemed like she was trying to mislead people into thinking she's for a $15 federal minimum wage. If that's not what you're for just explain your stance please."
"324",1460692438,"Hilary is very confusing and obtuse in her answers."
"325",1460719015,"it seemed like a fairly straight forward answer. Her stance is to push for a federal minimum of $12. If a bill somehow passes for $15, she is more than happy to sign it. 

But the bill she would put forward to congress if there isn't already legislation in the works, is $12"
"326",1460694201,"At least she gave a long diatribe on why @12 minimum is a step toward $15.  She couldn't give one reason for why she would oppose breaking up big banks.  Instead she refused to answer the question, repeatedly.  Then she claimed that it wasn't ""fair"" to ask her to release her $200,000  Wall St. speech transcripts because the ""other candidate"" won't.  We all know Bernie has no Wall St speeches but she is pretending otherwise. She will say anything no matter how ridiculous to win. "
"327",1460723100,"You have to be pretty dense to not understand her minimum wage argument. 12 as a baseline and a push for 15 in places that can handle economically. How is that hard?"
"328",1460705894,"There was nothing confusing about it at all. She's in favor of a federal, nationwide minimum wage of $12. She's in favor of higher minimum wages in states and cities like New York where the cost of living is higher."
"329",1460715245,"I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."
"330",1460701184,"I couldn't believe that she was doubling down on the Fight for 15."
"331",1460721331,"Not confusing if you understand how the world works. Same with converting to renewables. You have to make huge changes in phases, otherwise you get very bad side effects.  You can't just jack up minimum wage to 15 everywhere (nor should you as the cost of living in Manhattan and San Francisco is WAY different from places like Alabama and Montana ) immediately without bad consquences."
"332",1460709046,"Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"
"333",1460720963,"The answer seems weird but it makes sense when you consider how hard it is to get any legislation to the desk of the president. I'm sure Hillary's first choice would be a $12 national minimum wage, but if congress were to pass a $15 dollar one I'm sure she wouldn't veto it. It makes perfect sense."
"334",1460721880,"All of this is pointless.  Until the minimum wage is tie to an annual increase based on inflation.  The Cpi could be used or maybe something is better.  We have this discussion every 5 or 10 year.  If the wage is not adjusting for inflation annually then we will have this problem again."
"335",1460704518,"That looks Bernie gives her at 2:20 with the crowd booing."
"336",1460704333,"She was always for it... before she negotiated lower, settled for even less, and blamed someone else for its failure."
"337",1460703474,"I'm for whatever will get me nominated."
"338",1460714202,"What's so confusing? It was pretty clear: if you support the $15 min wage, then I support the $15 min wage, if you support the $12 min wage, them I support the $12 min wage.

It's very much in line with the rest of her platform: I support whatever gets me more votes."
"339",1460722401,"In case anybody missed it, here is what the New York State Senate passed:  
&gt;The raise goes into effect gradually, not immediately. In New York City, the wage will **reach $15 in three years**, and four years if a business has fewer than 10 employees. The wage would climb to $**15 on Long Island and in Westchester County in six years.**

&gt;The wage would increase more gradually upstate, hitting **$12.50 in six years.**

&gt;Further increases to $15 upstate would be tied to economic indicators like inflation and set by state budget and labor officials.

In California, the minimum wage increase is as folllows:  
&gt;This latest deal would increase the minimum wage to $10.50 next year, then $11 in 2018, with an increase of $1 every year until it reaches $15 in 2022. 

There are also ""off-ramp"" provisions in case of negative economic conditions, where a scheduled increase would not take place.

"343",1460725471,"I'm a Bernie supporter, but this is where I agree with Clinton. I believe $12 is a fair minimum wage nationally. Some areas like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco need more. However, I think $15 nationally is too high. Some 15 year old kid in bumfuck Nebraska doesn't need $15 an hour. It could dry up jobs and push automation along faster."
"344",1460703907,"She supports a $15 minimum wage in some high cost cities and a lower minimum wage in more rural areas. In any event, she thinks the federal minimum wage should be raised to $12. And if Democrats can somehow get higher than $12 through Congress, she'll happily sign it.

It's only confusing if you're sorta dumb."

The end result is their take-home money is DECREASED. This was modeled before it was ever implemented, and of course now it's been demonstrated in Seattle.  If you support a $15 minimum wage, you *must* pair it with EITC reform, or you are hurting more than helping."

Presidents come and go. But any particular supreme court can be around for 30 years.

If we let a republican president replace Scalia and Ginsberg, we can look forward to a reversal of Roe v Wade, reversal of gay marriage, overturn of the ACA, final destruction of unions and indivduals' rights to due process, and supremacy of business above all to an irreversible level."

The obstinate stupidity of this man, combined with self righteous indignity, can only lead to disaster. This is a secular country, that was the main attraction early on, even before we called it America. It was a place to escape persecution for being different. Quakers, shakers, puritans, etc. Everyone that was not part of the main church ruled by the king of wherever, was in danger until they escaped their homelands and got here. Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country. Our founders wanted the soldier's, and the king's taxes, out. It was not about establishing a Christian nation. They drank, they whored, they swore. They were men. Normal men. I am so tired of seeing every republican run like they wanted to be the next pope or something. Be as religious as you want to be, privately please. True religion is about faith, and faith is not for show."

Yeah sure Trump has said some wacky things, but I think a lot of it is exaggerated pandering.  I'm sure he understands that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress aren't exactly his biggest supporters so he would have to somehow appeal to both in order to get anything done.  However, the thought of Ted Cruz potentially making a Supreme Court nomination to a Republican controlled Congress is a future I don't want to have to deal with so at that point, I will begrudgingly give Hillary my vote if it means stopping Ted."

Ted Cruz however scares me shitless. It would be a step backwards to elect him. We'd have more religious tension discrimination than we already do. Even as a conservative leaning voter, i would never vote for Cruz. I'm economically/fiscally conservative but socially liberal. And Ted Cruz is the exact opposite. He's like Hillary Clinton except he wants to carpet bomb places is Iraq, ban gay marriage &amp;amp; abortion.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro–stupid shit?’ ”The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit.

Neither should Sanders. He claims that his wife handles the taxes, and that is good and fine, but if that's true there is no reason why she can't fly to Vermont grab em' and fly back.

How does this change anything? The transcripts are to establish whether or not there is a conflict of interest. Why would people make this into a petty ""omg you go first"" argument? They can both be guilty, so why wouldn't you all expect to see both things? 

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

This isn't a fucking game, it's not about picking teams. You should be expecting whoever you support to release their respective things, to further your support, and prove that they deserve it.

"533",1460724998,"The reason Bernie is winning, is because he cares. He doesn't act like a politician, he acts like a human. Great movements in America have always required being human before being a politician. Hillary is getting huge sums of money for being a Clinton.  She says she represents the people,  but she isn't talking about her ideas. She criticizes Bernie's ideas, and tries to find loopholes. When I watch her, it almost seems like she is arguing in court trying to use long articulated sentences while replying to simple questions.   She acts like what's done is done, and that these changes Bernie speaks of shouldn't be attempted.  In the 1700s, England was in its prime, and mighty.  The colonists were at their mercy, yet they stood up, and fought for what they believed in despite the situation being ""imlossible."" When Lincoln dropped the emancipation proclamation on the world, much of the United States didn't support this, he was even assassinated.  Here we are now.  To us common plebs it just appears as though Clinton is running for office because she wants to add that to her biography.   Sanders wants to/acts like he wants to make a difference. "

She's a poor rhetorician in a number of ways: her voice is shrill; her rhythm is flat; and her expression swings from serious to bemused to annoyed to offended. She also tends to dissemble. A lot. You see it when she begins a sentence with, ""I've always"" or ""my entire life"" or ""I've never"". It's simply not possible for a person to have always held a simple position on a complex issue such as the second amendment, social security, abortion. There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur.""

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."

They can change the world, maybe even get involved in local politics (where the religious right took over) and vote in off year elections (likewise).

&gt;Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, an Argentine and one of Francis’ key advisers at the Vatican, said he was aware of but disputed the perception that the pope disliked the United States. Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said. Francis recently helped negotiate a historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations that has led to restored diplomatic ties between the countries."

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

But they're next, and -- to mix a metaphor -- Clinton's weak showing is the canary in the coal mine."

"645",1460713913,"Because people are tired of protests that are nothing more than attention grabbing with no actual plan beyond ""look at me!""

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "
"646",1460681953,"Maybe because everyone is sick and tired of endless election year protests manufactured to grab headlines in promotion of one progressive cause after another, and the reporters know it? Just a thought."
"647",1460713934,"...Um.

It seems perfectly fair to criticize his answers as vague and lacking details because that is exactly what they are.

&gt; What I said was, Jeff, to clear the record and I think you'll agree on this, the danger of taking money from any interest is that you're not so aggressive in going after them, let's face it that's the real problem and I think we can agree on that.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.

I often encounter this belief on Internet forums and I'm baffled by it. Everyone agrees that businesses and corporations need to be managed but, apparently, that need disappears when it comes to capitalism on the national or global scale.

In five out of the seven years, the median salaries were slightly lower for women without Clinton’s salary included. But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

I believe that is what Paul Ryan and other conservative Republicans have argued for quote some time when they propose lowering the overall rate and simplifying (read: eliminate loopholes and special interest carve outs) the tax code.

It is Democrats who refuse to simplify the tax code while bitching and moaning that corporations pay no taxes... they need the wedge issue to whip the rank and file left in an outraged lather...

Besides, that there is the $1 trillion which was supposed to go for infrastructure but instead went where? - shored up public pensions.
And philosophically speaking: the Federal government has no right to create universal childcare. States could and if you want it, make that argument to your state legislature."

"1075",1460701278,"Most aren't denying the importance of infrastructure.  Most are debating the methods which should be used to pay for it.  The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

"1087",1460716790,"Bernie couldnt name one time Hillary was ""bought"". What a joke. "
"1088",1460711369,"Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

"1128",1460711369,"Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

"1220",1460694136,"National polls don't mean a lot right now, I think.  I believe it is the pollong on the coming primary states that really matter.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released.

Then every vote is recounted and the voting records with matching IDs are checked. There's no voter fraud and there's no need to register beforehand. Oh yeah, and we don't deny people the right to vote just because they've had trouble with the law before.

Local, regional and national parliaments are then divided based on the corresponding voter percentages. No first past the post shit. No gerrymandering shit. No electoral college shit. It's basic and it works because it's damn hard to corrupt it.

The problem is Bernie doesn't want to fully hang the albatross around Hillary's neck, perhaps in deference to the fact that she is likely to be the nominee and will need progressives' support in the general. 

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

Everyone in the establishment is warning that Bernie had better be careful and not do anything to permanently damage Hillary. But you KNOW if Bernie were leading Hillary would do everything she could to permanently damage Bernie without hesitation, because all she cares about is winning, despite her claims to the contrary. And nobody in the establishment would come to Bernie's defense and say ""hey back off don't destroy our potential nominee."" And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.  

Both conventions this year will be hotly contested.  We'll see delegates switching, terrible accusations being made, etc. But what we'll mainly see is a question of ""Who is the Party?  Is it the people who register and vote for that Party?  Or is it the few wealthy elites behind the scenes that are the Party?""

"1495",1460652034,"I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;After all that, Black came to the conclusion that “capitalism works better if we don’t have a class of banks who take all the reward and none of the risk.” And like Ryan, he thinks the fallout of that disparity is written all over New York city.

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.  Retorts are made to the candidate and not to the audience.  When candidates agree, they say so directly instead of diverting to a stump speech.

One of these executive orders, Action #14, noted that “in addition to being a law enforcement challenge, gun violence is also a serious public health issue that affects thousands of individuals, families, and communities across the Nation” (White House, 2013b). This order directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other relevant federal agencies, to immediately begin identifying the most pressing research problems in firearm-related violence with the greatest potential for broad public health impact...""

"1689",1460646398,"Now that I've gotten more involved in the local party, I'm all for superdelegates. Too many voters think those people with a 'D' next to their names just appear on ballots by magic. No bitch, there's a lot of work involved in getting and keeping Democrats in office, organizing, fundraising, strategizing, etc. and most voters couldn't give a fuck and just show up every four years.

The Democratic party is a business, the product is liberal policy and the customers are the electorate (all voters, not just Dems). Democratic primary voters are shareholders who can vote out the board but they're not up in this shit day in and day out. I have no problems if management (party insiders) has a more influential say."

"1699",1460647912,"After April 19th all this noise from the Bernie Supporters will tone down a bit. If he loses NY, considerably lose, and walks away with a very small proportion of the delegates; then Bernie needs to take a serious hard look at his campaign goals.

Is he going to concede to being a ""message candidate"" or keep marching forward off a proverbial cliff?

The math already does not work, and the math will basically be pretty damn solid after the 19th if he doesn't come away with a considerable delegate pull.

We also must realize that, as much as Redditors love Bernie, he isn't winning the Popular Vote either. Super-Delegates are not going to ""flip"" to someone not winning the majority of delegates nor the popular vote."
"1700",1460662599,"Part of this is the media's fault. Their push to show the super delegates before the voting has finished in order to make the results look like more of a landslide is biased. This bias attempts to paint Bernie's campaign as more of a lost cause and discourage supporters. This in turn causes supporters to want to do something about it. Also the super delegates maybe shouldn't pledge their support to a candidate before a single vote has been cast. "
"1701",1460631708,"Superdelegates have the right to vote for whomever they believe is the best candidate, and Sanders supporters have the right to attempt to change their vote.

What no one has the right to do is berate superdelegates, question their 'liberalism', 'Democratic values', or being accused of being bought or owned by corporations.

These tactics are no different from when Hillary supporters in 2008 berated Obama supporters for ""hating women"" because they weren't voting for Hillary.

"1710",1460634368,"i agree with the article, but I think its got to be made clear that harassment, being rude, and yelling and screaming and insulting people is completely un called for. and obviously threats are not only unacceptable but against the law. Theres a very vocal minority of sanders supporters who are just over the top about hillary, so much so I have a hard time telling their rhetoric from the tea partiers. I'm of the same mindset as robert reich who said she's a good candidate for the system we have now but bernie is the candidate for the government we need. Anyone who says she is no different from the GOP is foolish. She may be a typical politician but overall her policies will be very different from trump/cruz and even kasich."

Superdelegates have never decided a Democratic Party nominating contest. They will not decide this Democratic Party nominating contest. Stop publishing 19 columns about superdelegates a day.

Superdelegates are as much of a problem as electoral fraud and I do not see your outlet supporting voter ID laws.

"1712",1460630066,"My takeaway from the primaries -

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

One thing I do like about the primaries is that in most cases it is not winner take all. I would actually like to see the general election adopt a similar rule where state's electoral votes are awarded proportionally to the popular vote of that state."

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

"1765",1460646328,"&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

&gt; The saga continues.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;&gt;    a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

&gt;Really, we should do both. Politically, we'll do neither.

"2159",1460606262,"This comment section smells like sweat and desperation from a bunch of Hilary supporters.

You do realize that by insulting these people, encouraging Hilary to insult these people. You risk her losing their vote if she wins the primaries. 

Anyways, words like : Commie, Socialist, Atheist, etc..aren't really insults in the eyes of people under 30. We didn't live through the cold war. I see my father call him a socialist and then be like that's that. But you gotta see that people who weren't alive or of age during the cold war don't have that stigmatization about Socialism or Communism. That's not gonna be enough to deter Bernie's supporters."

She has had months to address this. No Democratic candidate should be able to deflect with ""I'll do it when the Republicans do it."" 

They're not the ones saying they support campaign finance reform, you are Hillary."
"2283",1460715858,"In regards to her speaking fees it would be nice for her supporters to at least admit there is a potential conflict of interest instead of acting like money influencing politics is an alien concept when it's come to the democrats."

"2285",1460713722,"The pressure will fade away, unless Bernie Sanders directly mentions it again, instead of through twitter or something"
"2286",1460724290,"Hillary's campaign was the first to make an issue of demanding president Obama's birth certificate. That bogus issue has dogged Obama for 8 years since.  Now she is making a fake issue of Senator Sander's taxes. She is very good at assassination by innuendo."
"2287",1460727513," What has she said in these speeches that scares her from releasing it.  I personally think she has criticised what ever little Obama has done about the banks as well as promised she will reverse it when she becomes president. That would destroy her candidacy as she has portrayed herself as someone that would take Obama's policies forward. And she has been on record saying that she wasn't planning to run for presidency when she gave those speeches."
"2288",1460720807,"Ultimately I believe she needs to feel the pressure from the voters before she'll ever do this.  She doesn't give two shits about this press coverage, or hash tags, or websites unless she starts to truly lose and those losses can be linked it this. Yes he won recently but NY will likely go her way bc of the bullshit closed primary and party affiliation change deadline. I keep reading that she's pressured and she seemed pissed last night at times but a NY win will chill her out quick. I hope I wrong about NY but I got too emotional after IL and FL to not be cautious. 

Further, it would have to be true desperation bc it seems like there's some BAD shit in there since they haven't been released yet. 

I'd put the liklihood that we ever see these at the same odds as my 7 year old declaring she's over Mac and Cheese. Basically zero. "
"2289",1460722558,"I kind of like Hillary - but why the Democratic Party allowed her to run and then backed her so strongly is beyond me. I would really like to see a women president but gender is secondary to merits. So much smoke ..."
"2290",1460728258,"*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton’s decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "
"2291",1460720511,"There are lots of things the Republicans haven't done yet, like embrace same sex marriage. 

If Clinton wanted to use Republicans as a reason not to get into something or do something, she could still hold her true beliefs that gays should not marry and just play it off like Republicans haven't done it yet. "

You compromise and wheedle and make get indebted to folks and they give you money and you that's how you get elected. Bernie is a crazy, weird unicorn. A Socialist independent. From Vermont. Who's unbeholden like Bernie? He's weird. A freak. From Mars. 

So yeah, I think he's right to say that she's got puppet strings. But I also think it's right of Hillary to say that her puppet strings aren't any different than the Republican candidates -- and in fact, probably less noxious, but she doesn't want to put hers on display, because the Republican super-pacs will run with that in the general, and she doesn't need any more Negatives. 

I'm calling this: Both Right. "

"2309",1460733323,"Is it possible that some of these transcript might not exist? Didn't she do a lot of panel discussions and interviews in addition to speeches? I just wonder if anybody would've even thought to keep those. 

Sure one possibility is that she's being secretive, but sometimes I wonder that they can't produce them because they don't know where they are, and she might not have known that when she said the transcripts would be produced. "

"2315",1460732044,"What if she *can't* release the transcripts? 

At first I thought it was probable that she'd said something innocuous-seeming but unethical. My working theory was that she'd told these groups of people that she was definitely running for president, which would have made the speaking fees FEC violations. But I decided last night, while she dodged this question multiple times, that maybe it's something else. 

Maybe those transcripts were stored on her private server along with the rest of the Clinton Foundation's documents. Maybe she can't release then because they're currently part of the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which is just one of the investigations currently underway. And if they are, then she can't really say ""Well I'd be happy to give them to you as soon as the FBI lets me.""

This is an unfounded theory with no evidence, obviously. Just thinking out loud here. But what if that's why?"

She cannot release the transcripts because it will sink her campaign over night and she and her advisors know this.  Bernie should've accused her relentlessly of saying one thing behind closed doors and another to the public, he should've made her so uncomfortable she had no choice but to relent and release the speeches--they would be the death knell of her campaign, when people realize how cozy she is with the big banks they are going to flee her in droves.

"2334",1460731914,"this is my main problem with Senator Sanders.  I love his position on 99% of the issues, BUT from all the stories I read about and looking at his voting record and his poor record in getting bills passed (2 post offices renamed and a veterans bill), it seems that Bernie will not work with people who are not 100% in alignment with his way of thinking.  We are still dealing with Republicans deciding not to work with Democrats because they lost the election.  I really do not feel energized to see a candidate who only became a Democrat, so he could get the democrat money to run for President and who will not only be unable to work with Republicans but also unwilling to work with many democrats.   

I also do not see a problem with the word establishment and will be more than happy when this election is over and the word is retired.   Sanders has been in government for a long time and the only reason he is not ""establishment"" is because he refuses to work with people and get things done.   In every aspect of my life, I want to work with people who are established."
"2335",1460732389,"Probs an unpopular opinion here considering the bubble, but that was one of Clinton's better moments from last night, she highlighted how difficult Sanders is to work with (something people like Barney Frank have said before) and how Sanders idealogical purity puts him at odds with would be allies. Even better for Clinton was that Sanders played right into it without realizing it.

&gt;""His holier-than-thou attitude - saying in a loud voice he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else - really undercuts his effectiveness,"" said Frank.
""To him, anybody who disagrees with him is a crook; there are no honest disagreements with people. Bernie's view of the world is that the great majority of people agree with him on all the issues and the only reason he does not win is that the Congress is crooked.""

And then he wants to turn around and act like he's some saintly outsider.

Bringing up more points. Bernie only kept talking past his allotted time so that he could finish his points. I also could not believe that on the topic of the Supreme Court nominations that Clinton brough up Roe v. Wade and what it is to be a woman and how women need rights. What the fuck did that have to do with the question? Nothing. This entire campaign she's been trying to convince people to vote for her just because she's a woman. It's ridiculous. I think that if we were actually scoring this debate that Bernie won."

But after having a couple of months to think about it, I think the real crux of the issue (which I don't see many people pressing) is that she made an active decision to accept payments from these organizations. She CREATED a conflict of interest. It was her decision. No one else made it for her. Politicians (universally) need to be transparent and disclose all potential conflicts of interest and this undoubtedly qualifies."

Sanders' final statement felt like history unfolding; that Hillary could not even begin to speak for several moments because of the chanting of Sanders' name, followed by her tepid plea for votes, was just a joy to watch.

What a time.  We could be watching serious history being made, right now."
"2351",1460696103,"Heres the thing about Hillary. She isnt much worse than any other politician out there. *Everyone* is corrupt. And compared to a lot of the corrupt politicians, Hillary isnt too bad. Thats why she thinks she's justified in not releasing the transcripts. Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change. 

If I could give Hillary one piece of advice, it would be this: Forget about yourself, remember America."

Voters are realizing they're hearing the same shit over and over, and it's not a direct answer to the question. Whatever is on those transcript, if they exist at all, at this point doesn't even matter. The fact that she doesn't have a direct answer is a full display of a lack of integrity.

Politics aside, Hilary is a despicable human being. She is everything that's wrong with politics. She embodies all the negative connotation that people associate with the idea of ""the establishment"". I hope she continues to get expose and this effectively end her political career entirely. "

Edit:  It seems like the most common defense is that guns are intended as a person killing device first. Others have pointed out that guns are used in many non-human-killing activities. I'll offer one thing further. Are guns designed to primarily kill people with malicious intent? If a gun manufacturer primarily makes their weapons as a product intended for defense of life and property, does that hurt the ""designed to kill people, therefore culpable"" argument?"

What do they think, ""A reliable supporter of..."" means?  Their own research proved specifically that he is not a reliable vote for the NRA, and the NRA agrees based on their grades of Sanders.  If the group that you supposedly support regularly gives you a grade of ""D"" for supporting them, you aren't a reliable supporter.  You aren't even an *unreliable* supporter.  It would be hard to call you a supporter at all.

Call it what it is: Hillary took a few pro-gun lobby votes and twisted it to call Sanders a friend of the NRA.  I'm not what you would call a ""reliable supporter"" of Bernie Sanders, but she lied.  C'mon.  Call a spade a spade."
"2396",1460694788,"yeah, the guy that wants another ""assault"" weapons ban is a supporter of the NRA.  That Sanders, he just loves the 2nd Amendment, all those hunters in VT love him.  Please"

You fucking wot?"
"2401",1460702675,"&gt; Schwerin also noted that Sanders voted for an amendment in the Brady Bill that allows prospective gun owners to buy a firearm if their background checks are not completed in three days. This is the amendment that facilitated Dylann Roof to purchase his .45 caliber Glock pistol, which he used to kill nine people in a historically black church in Charleston in 2015.

Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-05-20/news/9102270272_1_nra-officials-brady-bill-powerful-gun).) And source [for votes... another politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/) titled **""Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases?""**, rated **mostly true**       
Again. It's Vermont, I doubt Sanders would have made it to the Senate if he voted against the aforementioned stuff.

Is it likely (definitely possible) that she was paid money for nothing at all? Written off as giving a speech to make it ""legitimate"" but in reality just money paid to Hillary for who knows what reason. 

No hate necessary, just respond what you think.. 

Edit: Some users have pointed out she likely gave an off the cuff, no substance pep talk to the staffers. No transcript. Not actually given the money to do a speech. "

"2471",1460703751,"As I posted in another thread,  Were I advising Hillary:

&gt;""No, I won't release the transcripts, and here's why. **Bernie Sanders doesn't care what I said**. Not one bit. He hates that I made the speeches. He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

Yes, it's condescending. Yes,  it's denying some people what they want. But I don't see how her obvious lie and dodge is benefiting her, particularly as she has to repeat it over and over. Just own that you made a great living giving speeches, like frickin Alan Thicke does, and that your private work will remain private. "

"2488",1460712638,"There are a lot of comments here about how much people don't trust Hillary Clinton. They do trust Bernie Sanders. He has a lot of support with NYT readers. 

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it. 

If he wins the nomination and the presidency it will interesting to see how popular he is a year from now."

"2492",1460703012,"You can almost understand what she is saying: *if a left-wing Dem congress put a $15 federal minimum wage bill on her desk*, she would sign it. But she doesn't believe the political will is there, so she won't advocate or fight for it, because that's not ""pragmatic"" or politically viable.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

The Clinton revolution was basically founded on ""New Dems"" newfound role as hippie punchers, so triangulating against a hippie is making Hillary sound increasingly schizophrenic."
"2493",1460692526,"She looked so bad in this answer because it truly seemed like she was trying to mislead people into thinking she's for a $15 federal minimum wage. If that's not what you're for just explain your stance please."
"2494",1460692438,"Hilary is very confusing and obtuse in her answers."
"2495",1460719015,"it seemed like a fairly straight forward answer. Her stance is to push for a federal minimum of $12. If a bill somehow passes for $15, she is more than happy to sign it. 

But the bill she would put forward to congress if there isn't already legislation in the works, is $12"
"2496",1460694201,"At least she gave a long diatribe on why @12 minimum is a step toward $15.  She couldn't give one reason for why she would oppose breaking up big banks.  Instead she refused to answer the question, repeatedly.  Then she claimed that it wasn't ""fair"" to ask her to release her $200,000  Wall St. speech transcripts because the ""other candidate"" won't.  We all know Bernie has no Wall St speeches but she is pretending otherwise. She will say anything no matter how ridiculous to win. "
"2497",1460723100,"You have to be pretty dense to not understand her minimum wage argument. 12 as a baseline and a push for 15 in places that can handle economically. How is that hard?"
"2498",1460705894,"There was nothing confusing about it at all. She's in favor of a federal, nationwide minimum wage of $12. She's in favor of higher minimum wages in states and cities like New York where the cost of living is higher."
"2499",1460715245,"I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."
"2500",1460701184,"I couldn't believe that she was doubling down on the Fight for 15."
"2501",1460721331,"Not confusing if you understand how the world works. Same with converting to renewables. You have to make huge changes in phases, otherwise you get very bad side effects.  You can't just jack up minimum wage to 15 everywhere (nor should you as the cost of living in Manhattan and San Francisco is WAY different from places like Alabama and Montana ) immediately without bad consquences."
"2502",1460709046,"Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"
"2503",1460720963,"The answer seems weird but it makes sense when you consider how hard it is to get any legislation to the desk of the president. I'm sure Hillary's first choice would be a $12 national minimum wage, but if congress were to pass a $15 dollar one I'm sure she wouldn't veto it. It makes perfect sense."

&gt;The wage would increase more gradually upstate, hitting **$12.50 in six years.**

&gt;Further increases to $15 upstate would be tied to economic indicators like inflation and set by state budget and labor officials.

There are also ""off-ramp"" provisions in case of negative economic conditions, where a scheduled increase would not take place.

Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro–stupid shit?’ ”The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit.

was she wrong that transitioning from coal/oil to natural gas is a necessary incremental step between now and full reliance on renewable energy? I'd think especially somewhere like Europe where Russia has a stranglehold on their oil pipelines.

Sanders hasn't released them, it's been weeks and he hasn't released these tax returns the same returns which Hillary has released. People make the claims that he couldn't be bothered to return home while on the campaign trail but Mitt Romney was also on the rigorous trail and Romney didn't get a pass for it. Neither should Sanders. He claims that his wife handles the taxes, and that is good and fine, but if that's true there is no reason why she can't fly to Vermont grab em' and fly back.

How does this change anything? The transcripts are to establish whether or not there is a conflict of interest. Why would people make this into a petty ""omg you go first"" argument? They can both be guilty, so why wouldn't you all expect to see both things? 

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

This isn't a fucking game, it's not about picking teams. You should be expecting whoever you support to release their respective things, to further your support, and prove that they deserve it.

"2703",1460724998,"The reason Bernie is winning, is because he cares. He doesn't act like a politician, he acts like a human. Great movements in America have always required being human before being a politician. Hillary is getting huge sums of money for being a Clinton.  She says she represents the people,  but she isn't talking about her ideas. She criticizes Bernie's ideas, and tries to find loopholes. When I watch her, it almost seems like she is arguing in court trying to use long articulated sentences while replying to simple questions.   She acts like what's done is done, and that these changes Bernie speaks of shouldn't be attempted.  In the 1700s, England was in its prime, and mighty.  The colonists were at their mercy, yet they stood up, and fought for what they believed in despite the situation being ""imlossible."" When Lincoln dropped the emancipation proclamation on the world, much of the United States didn't support this, he was even assassinated.  Here we are now.  To us common plebs it just appears as though Clinton is running for office because she wants to add that to her biography.   Sanders wants to/acts like he wants to make a difference. "

She's a poor rhetorician in a number of ways: her voice is shrill; her rhythm is flat; and her expression swings from serious to bemused to annoyed to offended. She also tends to dissemble. A lot. You see it when she begins a sentence with, ""I've always"" or ""my entire life"" or ""I've never"". It's simply not possible for a person to have always held a simple position on a complex issue such as the second amendment, social security, abortion. There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur.""

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."

They can change the world, maybe even get involved in local politics (where the religious right took over) and vote in off year elections (likewise).

Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said.

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "
"2816",1460681953,"Maybe because everyone is sick and tired of endless election year protests manufactured to grab headlines in promotion of one progressive cause after another, and the reporters know it? Just a thought."
"2817",1460713934,"...Um.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.  She doesn't need to go to jail.. they need to revoke her clearance and boot her ass out of any position of responsibility."

I often encounter this belief on Internet forums and I'm baffled by it. Everyone agrees that businesses and corporations need to be managed but, apparently, that need disappears when it comes to capitalism on the national or global scale.

In five out of the seven years, the median salaries were slightly lower for women without Clinton’s salary included. But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

Guess what happens go the trust fund when people stop contributing to it?  It dries up, and the money that used to be there is now invested in the private sector.  (And if you invested poorly, enjoy eating cat food in your golden years.)

Why does Politifact seem so eager to go through the tortured exercise of calling this ""Mostly False""?

It is Democrats who refuse to simplify the tax code while bitching and moaning that corporations pay no taxes... they need the wedge issue to whip the rank and file left in an outraged lather...

"3245",1460701278,"Most aren't denying the importance of infrastructure.  Most are debating the methods which should be used to pay for it.  The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

But until Congress turns blue, we'll have Republicans who specialize in protecting the wealthy -- including their precious tax evasions schemes offshore.  And sure, there are some Dems who are as bad but keep in mind which party has made a specialty of talking about wealth envy, protecting 'job creators', and saving business from 'job killing rules' (like labor and enviro protections).  Electing a good president is not enough, it's time to change Congress if you are tired of wealthy people not paying their share."

"3258",1460711369,"Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.

Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana.

Even Mark Crispin Miller's reports about the elections of 2000 and 2004 never gained much traction. He and others like him get pigeonholed as tin foil hat conspiracists.

I pretended not to be registered and looked over the form and sure enough ""Republican"" was checked off on all of the forms in their possession. I told them then that I was already registered as an independent, that party affiliation was NOT required to vote and that these people were obviously lying, and I said it loudly enough that everyone around could hear me.

I found a campus security officer close by and told them that the people were scamming students and they told me there was nothing they could or would do about it.

"3479",1460653839,"Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman have written an [article](http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/36110-focus-is-the-2016-election-already-being-stripped-a-flipped) on the subject entitled, ""Is the 2016 Election Already Being Stripped &amp; Flipped?"", which is worth the read.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues."
"3480",1460657018,"Ok here's the thing. I believe this happened to me as well n the AZ primary. I'm not sure how to get the hard copy of the change but I may look into it. Anyways in order for this to be a conspiracy the change would have to benefit someone. I just don't see how anyone could benefit with certainty. Sure you could say Hillary benefited from me not being able to vote. But no one would have any idea if I was going to vote for Hillary of Bernie. It would be a crap shoot as to which vote got nullified. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have to error more on the side that this more of a database type problem. I saw tons of people in line with me that experienced that same issue. Seeing forged names looks suspicious but how could you possibly determine who could benefit from an affiliation change. Hell I'm not even in the under 40 group."

"3487",1460647058,"In NJ my wife and I both changed our registration to Dem to make sure we would be good to vote for Bernie in June. My registration change went through no problem, hers - not so much. She's listed as an independent even though she's positive she was a dem before hand. FYI she filled out the change registration forms at my request ""just to be sure"" even though she was sure she didn't need to. Luckily for her, you can change from independent to Dem in NJ on the day of the primaries"
"3488",1460666236,"Well if we can't have a fair and accurate primary, then we should just start focusing on the general election now. Bernie should just tell the DNC to go climb a tree, since they are incapable of running anything close to a fair election, and he should start running as an Independent (for Democracy sake). He has all the attention and momentum now. He shouldn't allow this charade to coronate Hillary first."

Here in Sweden, you get a unique voter form mailed to you, but it's possible to vote even without them. It's just easier with them. Then you go to your designated polling office, vote locally, regionally and nationally by choosing the party you want to vote for (we have a bunch) and showing a valid photo ID, like a drivers license or a passport. Then every vote is recounted and the voting records with matching IDs are checked. There's no voter fraud and there's no need to register beforehand. Oh yeah, and we don't deny people the right to vote just because they've had trouble with the law before.

Local, regional and national parliaments are then divided based on the corresponding voter percentages. No first past the post shit. No gerrymandering shit. No electoral college shit. It's basic and it works because it's damn hard to corrupt it. 

The US voting system is a laughing stock."

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.  

Both conventions this year will be hotly contested.  We'll see delegates switching, terrible accusations being made, etc. But what we'll mainly see is a question of ""Who is the Party?  Is it the people who register and vote for that Party?  Or is it the few wealthy elites behind the scenes that are the Party?""

"3665",1460652034,"I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;After all that, Black came to the conclusion that “capitalism works better if we don’t have a class of banks who take all the reward and none of the risk.” And like Ryan, he thinks the fallout of that disparity is written all over New York city.

This order directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other relevant federal agencies, to immediately begin identifying the most pressing research problems in firearm-related violence with the greatest potential for broad public health impact...""

I don't care who  these people personally vote for, I voted for all of them to represent the will of the people, they are our voice. Bernie won an overwhelming 70% of the caucus vote. I think it's shameful. As an independent Bernie has always said ""I have been in
the Democratic caucus in the House and the Senate from the first day that I took office"". These are our delegates not one for Bernie.

The current primaries, both Republican and Democrat,  clearly demonstrate Americans have no say over who gets elected.  It was the federal government that stole land from the Indians.  It was the federal government that stole land from Mexico.  It was the federal government that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.  Americans had less say about who was in the federal government back then than we have today.  It was the federal government that did all the bad things liberals dislike about America, and all the spending and regulation that conservatives dislike about Washington.

I wanted to vote for Trump this time around because I found his ""tell it like it is"" approach a breath of fresh air in a toxic cloud of politically correctness, but I guess he's not going to get the nod.

For a man who styles himself as a warrior against the establishment (you wouldn’t know it from his list of donors and endorsers), you’d think he would be demanding a vote for Coloradans. Instead, Mr. Cruz is celebrating their disenfranchisement.

Trump is right here, everyone should be pissed at this. Trump was favored heavily in Colorado  but they canceled the vote and then locked his delegates out of the building so they couldn't vote for him. Disgusting. "

This political malfeasance should have been checked by the Justice Department and FEC at the state level long ago since it reeks of political racketeering.  Offering to solve a ""problem"" that does not exist and using that effort as cover to create a major problem is quintessential racketeering.  As such, it seems to me that the Justice Department has ample legal justification to bring [RICO statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act) violations against the culprits."

"3852",1460642286,"I can guarantee that sanders supporters have whined 10000% more than super delegates have.

I mean the only reason the delegates are complaining is because Sanders supporters are en masse whining online."
"3853",1460643507,"Salon is such crap.  It's like the Breitbart or Daily Caller of the left.  Super delegates can do whatever the fuck they want--and if Bernie wants to change their minds, he'd have a much stronger case if he can catch Clinton in pledged delegates.

I guess DANIEL DENVIR has deadlines and this was the best he could come up with.  Nice title, Daniel--looks like your editor took the day off."
"3854",1460648005,"There is a difference between challenging and harassment.  Superdelegates are being called non stop and are being insulted over the phone.  That is no way to win anyone over."

"3856",1460642317,"Considering she has the pledged delegate lead and Bernie Sanders has never been a Democrat, I don't think his supporters have much to complain about in regards to super delegate loyalty "
"3857",1460647782,"Except you *DON'T* have the ""right"". The Democratic party is not a government agency. They are a PRIVATE ENTITY. They can pick a candidate however the fuck they want."
"3858",1460640377,"Keep threatening and harassing your superdelegates everyone and we will get Bernie the nom. Phonethreats and Facethreats! I left 30 or so threatening voicemails yesterday (Match me!) and plan on sending hundreds of threatening e-mails today! I also left a dead pig's head that I got from the slaughterhouse on the hood of my local superdelegate's car with a note that said ""Don't make a mistake you'll regret, little piggy. Support Bernie 2016!""

If we all do our part we can make it happen!

Bernie 2016"
"3859",1460646398,"Now that I've gotten more involved in the local party, I'm all for superdelegates. Too many voters think those people with a 'D' next to their names just appear on ballots by magic. No bitch, there's a lot of work involved in getting and keeping Democrats in office, organizing, fundraising, strategizing, etc. and most voters couldn't give a fuck and just show up every four years.

The Democratic party is a business, the product is liberal policy and the customers are the electorate (all voters, not just Dems). Democratic primary voters are shareholders who can vote out the board but they're not up in this shit day in and day out. I have no problems if management (party insiders) has a more influential say."
"3860",1460633112,"How about Bernie try to get as many normal delegates as Hillary before whining about the ones on top?"
"3861",1460645252,"What,  Bernie supporters are accusing other people of whining?  Did you know that I heard that Sanders is losing becasue the days of the week were named mostly after religious figures by the DNC."
"3862",1460644975,"I don't think anyone's opposed to contacting the offices of superdelegates to explain your position.

People are opposed to contacting the private residence, contacting them late at night, contacting their children, or yelling, threatening, or otherwise harassing them.

This behaviour would be unacceptable if it was your ex-boyfriend or literally anyone else, but apparently harassing people and their families now falls under ""Its just politics bro, why you heff to be mad?"""
"3863",1460629887,"So a whiny article is trying to tell others to stop whining, while at the same time trying to justify whiny Sanders supporters."
"3864",1460648535,"There is seriously only one camp whining about everything—the press, superdelegates, primary rules, the DNC, etc. etc.—and it's not Team Hillary. "

"3868",1460648001,"Well, Bernie Sanders people should stop whining about Super Delegates.  His top advisor, Tad Divine, was instrumental in the creation of Super Delegates. "
"3869",1460647912,"After April 19th all this noise from the Bernie Supporters will tone down a bit. If he loses NY, considerably lose, and walks away with a very small proportion of the delegates; then Bernie needs to take a serious hard look at his campaign goals.

Is he going to concede to being a ""message candidate"" or keep marching forward off a proverbial cliff?

The math already does not work, and the math will basically be pretty damn solid after the 19th if he doesn't come away with a considerable delegate pull.

We also must realize that, as much as Redditors love Bernie, he isn't winning the Popular Vote either. Super-Delegates are not going to ""flip"" to someone not winning the majority of delegates nor the popular vote."
"3870",1460662599,"Part of this is the media's fault. Their push to show the super delegates before the voting has finished in order to make the results look like more of a landslide is biased. This bias attempts to paint Bernie's campaign as more of a lost cause and discourage supporters. This in turn causes supporters to want to do something about it. Also the super delegates maybe shouldn't pledge their support to a candidate before a single vote has been cast. "
"3871",1460631708,"Superdelegates have the right to vote for whomever they believe is the best candidate, and Sanders supporters have the right to attempt to change their vote.

What no one has the right to do is berate superdelegates, question their 'liberalism', 'Democratic values', or being accused of being bought or owned by corporations.

These tactics are no different from when Hillary supporters in 2008 berated Obama supporters for ""hating women"" because they weren't voting for Hillary.

"
"3872",1460646048,"Sanders supporters have the right to threaten people at all hours of the night and harass a 12 year old because her parents were put on a Sanders supporter hit list?


You people have gone off the rails."

I DO take issue with how the general media is reporting the delegate totals between the two Democrats, namely including the (as yet technically uncommitted) superdelegates in the total counts."
"3880",1460634368,"i agree with the article, but I think its got to be made clear that harassment, being rude, and yelling and screaming and insulting people is completely un called for. and obviously threats are not only unacceptable but against the law. Theres a very vocal minority of sanders supporters who are just over the top about hillary, so much so I have a hard time telling their rhetoric from the tea partiers. I'm of the same mindset as robert reich who said she's a good candidate for the system we have now but bernie is the candidate for the government we need. Anyone who says she is no different from the GOP is foolish. She may be a typical politician but overall her policies will be very different from trump/cruz and even kasich."
"3881",1460647327,"Dear Salon,

Superdelegates have never decided a Democratic Party nominating contest. They will not decide this Democratic Party nominating contest. Stop publishing 19 columns about superdelegates a day. Your only goal seems to be ginning up division and phantom injustices in the Democratic Party in order to get clicks. This kind of journalism serves no one. Superdelegates are as much of a problem as electoral fraud and I do not see your outlet supporting voter ID laws. 

Sincerely,

"3882",1460630066,"My takeaway from the primaries -

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

One thing I do like about the primaries is that in most cases it is not winner take all. I would actually like to see the general election adopt a similar rule where state's electoral votes are awarded proportionally to the popular vote of that state."

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

"3935",1460646328,"&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

&gt; The saga continues.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;&gt;    a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

&gt;Really, we should do both. Politically, we'll do neither.

Which basically admits that Iran runs Iraq now. This is unsurprising given that Iraq is run by shities (who are also a majority in Iran) but it also means that the sunnis there have *zero* incentive to cooperate. Which is why many are joining ISIS, because it's their only alternative.

Over a decade of war in Iraq, just to have everyone come to the conclusion that it should be a satellite state of Iran, in perpetual war with the northern half of the country."

"4452",1460651684,"Sanders is currently getting ~35% of the black vote in most states.  He was getting 10-20% when virtually the entire South had primaries.

I did an analysis of what the delegates totals would be if the South voted today, and if Bernie lost the black vote by 40 points (30-70) Clinton's lead would be about ~115 less, or around 100.  This is assuming he still does a little worse than he has in statess like Missouri, but I think the 30% is a reasonable mark.  

So yes, mathematically it did distort reality.  This isn't to say that the South should be disregarded, it is saying that having the South first as a monolithic block definitely had an impact on the race.

They MUST decrypt the data if the government so requires. Obviously, it is not possible if the encryption occurs **client side** and the key is in the hands of the user.

* almost all encryption experts think it is a bad idea, and makes it impossible to secure personal, medical, and financial data.

* terrorists and criminals will always have their own encryption, like PGP.   Or use foreign services.  This will affect only ordinary citizens.

* This bill will hurt US industry, and force anybody who incorporates security to move offshore. 

* This bill is extremely invasive: Taken at face value, even the web browser you and I are using may become illegal to distribute, because its authors (covered entities under Section 4(4)) can't decrypt messages it sends [Section 3(a)(2)],  including this message.

I'm all for privacy, but if you commit a crime don't you forfeit that right to some extent?  Shouldn't we, as a society, have some mechanism for catching criminals and enforcing laws?  Why should we make it easier for the outlaws and scumbags of our society to hide their activity?

It doesn't seem to me that a backdoor would be required if user-side encryption is the problem.

California did this in the 70s and it led to the so-called ""tax revolt era"" where citizens overwhelmingly voted in favor of restrictions on the ability of the state to raise tax revenue from property and business taxes. Result: CA nearly went bankrupt in the 80s and 90s because they couldn't raise taxes to generate new revenue. 

So, while direct democracy sounds great, you have to realize that MOST citizens don't actually know how to run a state/country. This is PRECISELY why our founding fathers set up the U.S. as a republic, not a democracy. "

To go out of the country for almost two days just a few days before the NY primary is dumbfounding, especially when Bernie has shown multiple times that the more time he spends campaigning in a state before the voters vote, the better he ends up doing. Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do. As a Bernie supporter, I'd prefer he'd skip the speech, and spend the time campaigning in NY instead."
"4608",1460643856,"He better hope the debate ends right on time. 

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

"4670",1460660064,"&gt; Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job. Let's not make ovaries a requirement of high office--just like we wouldn't make religion or race or whatever. "

If anything I think the reverse is more true - Bernie supporters tend not to understand Hillary supporters. See the constant beffudlement whenever she wins the black vote in a state, for example. Or else they simplify it to ""they are evil/love corruption"". "

"4690",1460671619,"&gt; Clinton is ahead by two points, edging Bernie Sanders by 48-46 percent.  Last month, before Sanders won eight of the nine most recent contests, she had a 13-point advantage (55-42 percent).

"4701",1460679229,"Jackson was a ~~badass~~ fucking insane person:

&gt;The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

Many Verizon employees are being placed on emergency work assignment to fill the position of these union members. My mom has had this lingering assignment weighing over her head since these strike talks began. She also had to participate in this same issue in 2011 when the first phase of strikes began. It is not just the union workers that are being mistreated by this corporation, but the other employees that work hard day-to-day without going on strike to ask for increased wages/benefits. There is more to this story than what is being covered in the news. "
"5067",1460582922,"These companies hold private court with our elected officials and then pretend not to see that as an advantage over their employees. I know the only reason I ever contact or send contributions to politicians is either hoping their vote will influence a law or to thank them for great representation.

 A lot of people aren't even making enough to save and yet people will call them greedy for wanting decent wages and working conditions. And a lot of the avenues that we once had to represent that have been eroded away over the years by folks like the heads of Verizon. It's not just Clinton turning a blind eye to or gladhanding this situation, but as far as I know, it ain't Sanders. He seems to be the only person that gets the part I'm worried about."

http://www.exposethetpp.org/TPPImpacts_InternetFreedom.html

&gt;The Trans-Pacific Partnership Would Undermine 
Internet Freedom
Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning."

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it. And capital should be taxed the most. Spend it or lose it, once again encouraging consumption."

"5119",1460647105,"As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

* Democratic turnout was over 1.86 million voters. (Republican turnout was just under 643,000)
* For further reference that is about 1.5x the voter turnout for Dems in Massachusetts in both 2008 and this year and only slightly more than Rep. voter turnout in Mass this year
* Massachusetts has ~1/3 of New York's population, but has open primaries. This shows either the huge opportunity for either candidate to drive voter turnout on Tuesday, or just how much closed primaries affect turnout, or both.

Hillary Clinton reads a script that includes her direct involvement in the ""CP time"" joke, and decides that is a good idea. After being called out on it she does not apologize, and also shifts the blame to de Blasio.

Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily.

"5394",1460613664,"I hear Arkansas exports liars to New York, though."
"5395",1460615853,"Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

**TL/DR: Lies, Damn lies and statistics**"
"5396",1460604171,"Oh. and how many of those guns recovered in New York came from... New York?"

"5398",1460586320,"Shut up guys, she 'misspoke'"
"5399",1460600947,"Given that many gun owners have access to a small arsenal. Those 55 guns could have come from just one person."
"5400",1460605103,"Clinton, when asked to comment explained that *facts have a well known Democratic Socialist bias.*"
"5401",1460638775,"Typical establishment Clinton, use the violence created by the war on drugs for political gain."

"5403",1460625133,"Did Bernie smuggle all 55 guns?

"5404",1460604739,"So Bernie only needs to point out the proportion that came from NY to counter?"
"5405",1460609468,"She's grasping at straws here. Maybe she should stop trying so damn hard. The lies didn't work in 2008, why does she think they'll work now? &gt;_&gt;"
"5406",1460613726,"Does she think this whole 'Guns from Vermont' talking point is that important or damaging towards Bernie? "
"5407",1460625871,"Bernie getting a taste if the rabid lefts gun control lies. They do this shit to Republicans all the time. "
"5408",1460630868,"People talk about what a brilliant politician she is, but what Clinton really has going for her is epic cynicism. She knows Vermont will never go to her, so she throws this peaceful little state under the bus. 

It's like Saruman the White saying the Shire is responsible for the rise of Sauron."
"5409",1460635413,"So restrictive gun laws don't stop the guns /shock. "
"5410",1460637199,"Why didn't she do anything about this when she was a Senator?"
"5411",1460624481,"Maybe it's just me but I see Bernie supporters in no way supporting her and probably going to Trump with her lying corporate establishment ways."
"5412",1460632263,"I am shocked and appalled that anyone would suggest she would ever mislead anyone or lie!"
"5413",1460635408,"Politic act did this one...TECHNICALLY it's partly true because it's the highest number per citizen ratio, or something like that? I'm on the bus. But yeah, still so snakey"
"5414",1460635473,"But what about the ones that weren't recovered? Of the millions of potential unknowns guns they could all be traced back to Bernie Sanders for all we know! "
"5415",1460639795,"Or because the black drug dealers take their drugs up into Vermont, knock up a nice white girl, buy a gun and head back home to New York.

Touché Billary."
"5416",1460640649,"You know those Vermont people...they get all hopped up on maple syrup and those self-constructed Teddy Bears and all of a sudden it's the wild west.

I'm ready for Clinton to be out of my life now..."
"5417",1460653342,"Rule number one: Clinton lies."
"5418",1460656045,"So about seven-tenths of one percent?!"
"5419",1460658749,"
why does she do this?  does she think she's not observed, that no one fact checks?

why, why, why?  it's embarrassing to observe and it's so craven on her part."
"5420",1460663506,"Don't worry, she told those gun manufacturers to cut it out"
"5421",1460666264,"""you would have a hard time convincing people that the NY crime problem was being exported from Vermont""

.... Ah yeah, no shit! 

Also only 55 guns out of 7,686 recovered were from Vermont.

What is she smoking? "
"5422",1460585710,"Fuck that ugly bitch. On second thought I'll pass."
"5423",1460625630,"almost certainly a meaningless stat, but it's true that per person in VT this small number of 55 is bigger than the others

if this trend held up with other states with lax gun laws, i think that supports her position that it hurts new york that states have these laws"
"5424",1460647795,"Which is the highest % of any state that they could tie the guns to"
"5425",1460600007,"She cunt stop lying. "
"5426",1460721571,"&gt;Trump has even had the temerity to describe NATO, the first peacetime military alliance the United States ever joined, as obsolete. “It was really designed for the Soviet Union, which doesn’t exist anymore,” he said last month. “It wasn’t designed for terrorism. . . . A new institution, maybe, would be better for that than using NATO, which was not meant for that.”

In spite of everything else, I strongly suspect no one would be discussing the uselessness of NATO without him in the race."
"5427",1460665647,"At what point do they realize that we can see they're not working in the public interests?"
"5428",1460668743,"&gt; But that’s exactly what happened anyway. Congressional Republicans responded to the request by telling the administration to use $600 million that had been allocated to combat Ebola. The trouble, of course, is that this money (a) is far short of the $1.9 billion needed, and (b) still being used to address Ebola in West Africa.

Apparent the ebola epidemic that the GOP was screaming their heads off about wasn't really that big of a deal. Not apparently important enough to ensure that the epidemic will indeed be extinguished."

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"

"5565",1460625392,"So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".

Mainly the utility poles, trenches and limited usable frequencies that all traverse public space to connect us all together.  It is very similar to our interstates and roadways.  Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

Right now it isn't widely deployed for orders to be made via a screen in a restaurant, but it has been showing up in some places and a higher minimum wage will certainly make more places consider the switch.  If something costs $50k to install and $1k a month to maintain (totally making up numbers) and you're open 12 hours a day 7 days a week then it might not make sense to switch to an automated system if you're paying $8 an hour.

1. What about people whose employers send out W-2s (or other documents) late or with incorrect information? Employers won't like the potential for liability on their part.

"5838",1460597648,"Now that hes getting desperate and recognizes he's losing, it makes sense he is starting to run a negative campaign. So much for his pledge never to"

Sex workers deserve respect like anyone.

It's not right to compare them to corporate democrats."
"5843",1460659464,"I predict this will get little traction, then large numbers of people will continue to incredulously ask why Sanders will not disavow people who do or say bad things.

Just went to /r/politicaldiscussion to see what they had to say about it. Their take is that Sanders is personally responsible for anything anyone supporting him says, that he should proofread everything they create before publishing, and that even if he does disavow the bad things it doesn't matter because it reveals the true nature of the man himself.

So, pretty much as expected."
"5844",1460661712,"I'm glad that Sanders has apologized to Hillary ""CP Time"" Clinton"
"5845",1460660526,"Insensitive? 

Is that somehow a wrong statement?

They're whores of a system that continually  engages in corporate bukkake. Maybe that's not ""PC"", but it's an accurate assessment of our current political system."

You can't keep bringing up Michigan without addressing it as an outlier.  

After Michigan there were a lot of red faces.  Polling companies make their money on being accurate.  They weren't and they fixed their methods.  It's unlikely to happen again. "

Especially since their main argument against Hillary being a champion of voting rights is that she didn't do anything about this specific incident.

Clinton would be better than all of them in every way but Sanders would be better than her in every way."

"5886",1460663987,"For the sake of our climate alone, the GOP must be kept from power."

If Clinton wins the nom or Sanders drops out early, Sanders will wait &lt;30 days and then start campaigning ferociously for her."

Regardless of who wins, at least it would shake up the establishment somewhat.  "
"5896",1460646311,"The only way they'd have been relevant is if he got a majority of the delegates.

The way it is designed is if no one gets the majority, it heads into brokered convention territory and then (some) delegates are released from their obligations and can vote anyway they want. Next vote, all delegates are released.

If you get your majority, you win, if not, throw out the primaries it's wheel and deal time."
"5897",1460649740,"It is great to see these parasitical organizations that have latched onto our democracy like ticks, losing control and watching them squirm as they try to reassert their hold on the system. "

"5899",1460646528,"The Trump train makes up almost 40% of the Republicans. If he's screwed out of the nomination, then the RNC can expect to lose much more then the white house "
"5900",1460646276,"Mr. Two Corinthians is hardly a Republican, it's no wonder they are not happy with the idea of him trying for the leadership of the Party. At 69 years of age he's only been a Republican for what, 6 or 8 years now? What are his views on the core issues, the things that make up the Republican Party Platform? 

"
"5901",1460646231,"They are shattering their dumpster fire of a party. It is fantastic. "
"5902",1460674224,"&gt;Still, 24 percent of Sanders supporters say they would not back Clinton if she became the nominee. Fewer Clinton voters (9 percent) say that about Sanders should he capture the nomination.

This should be a huge cause for concern to the DNC if they desire a Clinton nomination and it also answers the question in the title quite clearly."
"5903",1460675340,"Bernie will need to endorse HRC and campaign for her for the Democrats to succeed in the fall. The DNC will need to adopt a few of his platform stances and actively give him credit for pushing the party towards the economic policies of the people struggling with the grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality. Then Obama, Biden and Elizabeth Warren need to be unleashed on the trail. Should Bernie pull off an upset, he will need Obama to electrify the older African American church goers."
"5904",1460673947,"I would suspect it would be Bernie. He's not out of touch with the basic Democratic principles. Even Hillary supporters tend to like him and his ideas, they just don't tend to think they are possible and want incrementalism instead.

Hillary will alienate the progressive wing of the party though."
"5905",1460675897,"We don't have to worry about uniting the Democrats.  The overwhelming majority of people who identify as Democrats will vote for whomever the Democratic Party nominates if he/she is running against Trump or Cruz.

We have worry about attracting non-Democratic voters in the general election, because the Democrats cannot win a general election without them.  Bernie gets far more independent voters and Republican crossover votes, both in general election forecast polls and in open primaries.  That alone makes him the most electable candidate."
"5906",1460674347,"Well according to this poll more Democrats would enthusiastically support Sanders as the nominee than Clinton, and a lot more democrats would not support Clinton as the nominee than Sanders.

So I guess the answer is Sanders."

"5908",1460680001,"Democrats need to trade Hillary to the Republicans for a couple prospects and a future draft pick.  She'd be infinitely more comfortable running as a moderate Republican, she'd give them a real candidate, and the country could have the best general election matchup in decades.  "
"5909",1460676411,"The only party that a Hillary Clinton nomination can unite... Is the Republican party, against her.

A Clinton nomination will guarantee a Republican presidency."

"5911",1460677273,"Hillary could actually win. The majority of Americans are that fucking clueless. They will vote for corporate shills until most of them are living in complete poverty.  "

"5913",1460664051,"""Change his mind"" isn't something Sanders really does, for better or worse."
"5914",1460665944,"I am a graduate-educated mostly informed citizen and I am strongly against nuclear energy. 

Unlike wind and solar energy production..... (a) it is not safe - we have never had a decade without a major nuclear disaster that affected the entire planet; (b) we have no safe way of storing nuclear waste, certainly not a cheap way; (c) nuclear is not all that green - lots of dirty energy involved in mining and transport; (d) expensive to secure and maintain; (e) that land where the plant is will not be used again for literally thousands of years (!); (f) it enables terrorists and states to wield terrible power. 

When society is conserving energy, turning the lights off above car dealerships for instance, maybe limiting yacht size, then we can talk about drastic means to secure more energy. Until then, Sanders is correct in responding to the science that our energy needs can be met with more sustainable less dangerous less expensive methods."
"5915",1460662236,"I'd like for him to change his mind on this issue as well as GM-labeling."
"5916",1460663112,"I'm sorry, and I may be alone on this, but I don't agree with a nuclear energy push in favor of a push for renewable energy.

Insurers won't even think about writing coverage on nuclear power plants, so any issues that arise will make the company insolvent or put the onus on cleaning up or repairing any damage on the taxpayers. I know that nuclear power is generally considered safe, but accidents can and do happen, and by increasing the exposure to that risk we greatly increase our chances of a catastrophic event.

Fukushima and Chernobyl are solid examples of one-off occurrences creating a ridiculous environmental and financial impact. Three mile island's cleanup in PA cost 1 billion dollars and lasted from 1979 to 1993."

"5921",1460662694,"of course Hillary came right out and condemned her own foundation consultant calling the Sanders rally a nazin rally. Oh wait, she didnt?"

"5923",1460662839,"Sanders apologizing for a supporters' choice of a word.

Settled. Hillary, take note; this is how you behave like an adult. "
"5927",1460561145,"I don't understand why people think gun manufacturers should be allowed to be sued if another PERSON uses their product illegally.

We don't allow people to sue Ford, Chevy, etc. when a drunk driver hits someone and half the time we likely couldn't sue a pharma company either if a drug we willingly take hurts us unless we find unlawful practices later on involved.

The gun manufacturers are simply businesses selling their product, it's not their fault what others do with them.

EDIT: So according to people you are technically ""allowed"" to sue motor companies but it'll get thrown out in a heartbeat, same principle applies to gun manufacturers IMO."
"5928",1460561140,"Hey, you endorsed her."
"5929",1460561157,"Didn't this paper also feature another gun lie about Bernie on its front page?  Pretty shameful when SE Cupp is correctly calling you out for lying."

"5931",1460561050,"I feel like we have two religious conservatives who both hate gays. One is from the Westboro Baptist Church and wants them all put to death, and she constantly abuses the other conservative who doesn't want them to marry, have equal rights, serve in the military, or be able to adopt, but otherwise at least he'll leave them alone.

In short, we have the crazed fringe lunatic attacking the one who at least shows a little bit of sense, even if he's still generally wrong. "
"5932",1460571962,"Okay, so according to her logic, if I am a katana manufacturer and I sell katanas, I should be held responsible for what my customers do with their katanas.

Like What the fuck is this bullshit. No, life doesn't work that way. I sell a product legally to someone and that's that. They can use it how they want; *they* are responsible for their own darn actions. What is this, a kindergarten playground? Are we not adults that take responsibility for our own actions?

"5945",1460573391,"But she's not lying...

SE Cupp, Conservative commentator, compares it to being why we ""don't sue car companies that make cars that criminals use."" What she misses is that, although it may not be a good idea to sue car companies, **you can**. 

Gun companies, on the other hand, cannot even have these same types of suits brought against them.

If these suits were so damaging, wouldn't they be putting car companies out of business?

Sanders people are using the GOP's logic to defend him here."

The three candidates are Zephyr Teachout of New York, Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and Lucy Flores of Nevada."
"5950",1460570357,"Good. 

If the Democrats have learned anything over the past few years, they need to learn that down ticket elections mean just as much as the presidency. The trick now is to be able to do it on a non Presidential election year."

"5953",1460584428,"why has he taken so long to do this?"
"5954",1460577501,"This is part of why it's still important to vote in the primary even if we've reached the point where Hillary clinches, downticket candidates! In most places theyre nomination is on the same ticket. Additionally even in a losing effort the more Bernie delegates at the convention the better for progressives as they vote on the party platform. If you're a liberal go out n' vote to pull the party to the left."
"5955",1460569210,"I think the bigger story is that the political revolution is happening! Bernie is not just running to become president, he's running to get rid of corruption and fix a broken system. There is no better way to achieve this than by getting people with the same political view into power. As Bernie says himself, change doesn't come from the top, it comes from the bottom."

"5960",1460565386,"So this is an interesting timeline:

3 House Candidates Endorse Him

In turn, Bernie raises money for those candidates and endorses them back.

Why is this okay that he raises money for them AFTER they've endorsed him? Aren't Sanders fans the same people who think that everyone who has endorsed Clinton is not doing it out of the goodness of their heart but trying to get the windfall of Clinton's money and endorsements sent to them?  How is this any different?"
"5961",1460617259,"But but but r/hillaryclinton told me that Bernie doesn't give a shit about downticket candidates!

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE?"
"5962",1460604432,"ok"
"5963",1460634900,"Should've endorsed his ugly wife."
"5964",1460590065,"Sexist. Should have endorsed 4."
"5965",1460575915,"Let's hope all three of these cunts lose."
"5966",1460585658,"Remember calling Clinton ambitious is ""sexist."" However, promoting three women house candidates is something a sexist would do."
"5967",1460557851,"Sanders needs to catch 223,000 votes to win New York. This union represents 36,000 people and has 26,000 retirees. I'd say its reasonable to suggest this could give him a bump in the polls and contribute to momentum as now all the people in the union will talk and look into the two candidates more, which always benefits Bernie. "
"5968",1460560501,"Excellent!

It's even sweeter because the union membership voted, not just a couple of people at the top."
"5969",1460559649,"Hillary failed the metro card swipe test.  "
"5970",1460558514,"I'm so proud to be a card carrying Subway rider right now."
"5971",1460558966,"Bernie's the real deal.  You can't buy these votes.  

When you let the workers speak they will back their candidate. 

Randi Weingarten should take note on how real union leadership does it."
"5972",1460580307,"Another crippling loss for Sanders.

"6135",1460607809,"Okay. It is good as the whole build-up to it is ""Save the children!"". But here's why it is not good in the long run. It costs $10,000 just to apply to be a grower. Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

TL;DR Read the fucking thing. It's important!

There, representatives of the coup regime were placed on an equal footing with representatives of Zelaya’s constitutional government, and Costa Rican president Oscar Arias (a close U.S. ally) as mediator.  Unsurprisingly, the negotiation process only succeeded in one thing: keeping Zelaya out of office for the rest of his constitutional mandate.  "" http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/09/24/hillary-clinton-emails-and-honduras-coup"

On the day of the debate the room fills up with a good sized audience (30-40) of people who apparently didn't know we were assigned these debate topics/positions and they weren't necessarily our own views.

Our group had to sit in front of these people while they hurled vitriolic shit at us for an hour. I will never forget this assistant professor in the front row that chose me as her target to spew her righteousness at about how these protestors were good for America and people like me were the problem.

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.

The other two bills would end gerrymandering — the practice of drawing congressional districts to favor political parties — and restore the Voting Rights Act, also struck down by the Supreme Court in recent years.

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!"

Violence against the police only makes people STOP liking you.  You can get your message heard these days, thanks to mass media and social media, so easily.  But, there is also the side-effect that all the douchey stuff you do becomes noticeable too, on both sides, right away.

Seriously, if any of you are planning on protesting, do it peacefully.  Don't turn into one of those mentally challenged protesters, ""But you're a white male!"" as you scream in someone's face that they can't possibly relate because of that.  As soon as you start blocking ambulances and throwing stuff at police, I instantly think you are a scummy person of low intellectual capacity.

Seriously, think about it for a second, what does blocking an ambulance on the street actually do.  What is the purpose of your protest.  Do you think people are going to become enlightened to your message and flock to you and be inspired by you by doing that?  Now, I assume most of you reading this are reasonably intelligent people to agree with this idea that ya, that is dumb.  But you see, that is why I think I am completely justified in questioning the intellectual capacity of morons that do things like that because they lack so much self-awareness as to not realize the stupidity of it all.  It can't just be mob-mentality.  It can't just be brainwashing.  Brainwashing happens, but a smart person will at least approach and follow the cause in some meaningful and intelligent way...

This is the problem with WaPo and other MSM outlets today. It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd. It's the constant defeatism and uninspiring approval of the truly meager progress being made that shifts focus away from the biggest problems in today's political landscape, which *are* structural and pervasive, not specific and discrete. How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

The rise of both Sanders *and* Trump is showing us that people are *not* happy with status quo politics or politicians. That the majority of people want *drastic* change, not faux pragmatism that is really leading us nowhere fast. The fact that the media is doing more to instill complacency than shine light on the problems that millions of people are already realizing without their help is not only depressing, it's scary."

For example: Sanders ""you don't know what it's like to be poor"" statement was rated ""false"" by politifact by the logic that white people can be poor, therefore Sanders is wrong, QED. However, it completely cut out the context: That white people *on average* don't know what it's like to simultaneously be hit with poverty *and* systemic racism, and that poor black people *on average* have it worse than poor white people because of the multiplicative nature of those two things.

&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;LeBretton said a representative for the Obama administration then asked New Balance to accept a compromise version of the trade deal, **partly** in exchange for a pledge of help getting the Department the Defense to expedite the purchase of US-made shoes.

""Partly""? This allegation needs to be a lot more specific to be taken at all seriously. Who exactly is he claiming promised something and who did they promise it to? Does ""partly"" mean the linkage between the trade deal and the military bidding process was inferred? As he also mentions a ""compromise version of the trade deal"" being discussed was this a USTR rep running some potential trade deal changes by someone from the company who was serving on one of the advisory committees? Finally, LeBretton says nothing about anyone being asked not to ""bad-mouth"" the deal -- where does that allegation come from?

&gt; That $1.8 billion in relief from Goldman that's supposed to help homeowners in distress? Miller says that in these cases, the terms are kept vague, and Goldman can use that money to do things that are in its best interest anyway, like writing off debt that's obviously not going to be repaid, demolish foreclosed upon houses, and modify mortgages that are in distress.

&gt;""It would be like me agreeing to be right handed all day today or to wake up tomorrow morning and have coffee,"" Miller says of the settlement agreements. ""Those things are going to happen anyway.""

&gt;He also pointed to something critics have called the ""bullshit-to-cash ratio"" as one indicator of how little the penalty will affect a giant like Goldman. Basically, it's important to note that only about $3 billion of the $5 billion will be paid out in cash. On the other hand, about half is tax-deductible and will be placed on the backs of taxpayers––even though the median American family lost about 40 percent of their wealth during the worst stretch of the crisis.

&gt;What's more, the New York Times notes that after incentives and tax credits, Goldman can chop about a billion dollars off the total penalty. According to a chart attached to the settlement, for every dollar Goldman puts into community investment in New York, they get a $2 tax credit."

"7154",1460558485,"Banking Execs: #Too Big Too Jail"
"7155",1460564042,"One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

The reason why his 7 state win streak hasn't accounted to a huge change in the race is most of those states are smaller states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming) And the system is rarely a winner take all, and winning by a huge margin in a state worth 20 to 30 delegates isn't worth as much by winning a state worth 300 by the same margin or even a much closer one.  For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

"7284",1460510197,"I have been stalking this election as an outside observer to the US and it really is fascinating to me. I am utterly bemused by the lack of critical analysis of a range of sources and the ability for everyday Americans to draw their own informed and fully justified conclusion.


I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

I am reminded of Sarah Palin's famous quote; ""*FRUIT FLIES!*"""
"7403",1460675176,"Here is the abstract:

&gt;This interdisciplinary research project will advance basic understanding of how tax compliance behavior emerges by focusing on how perceptions of risk and tax fairness form, how these perceptions spread through a social network, and the interplay caused by the complex feedback loops among individual behaviors and population-level outcomes. The project also will address how audit, penalty, and taxation policies, and changes in those policies, influence perceptions and ultimately reduce tax evasion. The project will provide new insights regarding how tax compliance behavior is modified by the perceived aggregated compliance and on how behavior and the perceived aggregated compliance depend on social network structure over which perceptions of taxation spreads. The project will demonstrate the utility of the use of agent-based modeling for research on interactions between individuals and governments as well as how data from the American Life Panel collected by Rand Corporation can be employed to address problems like this. The analysis also will have practical utility, because it will shed light on why certain countries with high taxation levels, such as Scandinavian nations, can maintain high levels of tax compliance while other countries with lower taxation levels may have high levels of tax evasion as is the case in Greece and Italy. Project findings therefore should help nations like the United States reduce the occurrence of tax evasion.

&gt;Income tax evasion is a problem that poses considerable challenges for tax authorities and governments at the local, state, and federal levels. Its causes and implications are both economic and social. The role of tax evasion-related perceptions and how social networks influence those perceptions remain poorly understood, however. The investigators will build an agent-based computational simulation model of income tax evasion. Within the simulation, the compliance behavior of individuals will change through an adaptation process based on their past experiences with audits and tax evasion penalties, their perception of the fairness in taxation rates, and social interactions with people in their social networks. In conjunction, the investigators will conduct a national survey on the perceptions of tax fairness. The survey will gather individual-level data that will inform the simulation model's behavioral mechanisms. These mechanisms influence the propensity to evade, and the survey provides an empirical basis for choosing model-specific parameter values. Model assumptions will further be informed using sensitivity analyses. The simulation model will be validated and calibrated to reproduce U.S. national levels of income tax compliance for different tax brackets. In addition to the U.S., the model also will be calibrated using data sets and compliance levels for Greece and Denmark. Once calibrated, the model will be used to understand how tax evasion behaviors evolve differently depending on various starting assumptions, such as how social networks are structured or what fiscal policies are in place and the conditions for the system to produce tipping point dynamics. The model then will be used to identify fiscal policies that are most effective in minimize tax evasion and recovering compliance. The investigators will employ robust decision making, a method for improving policy decision making, to rank policies based both on their potential performance, as well as how robust this performance is to the key sources of uncertainty. This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.

Of course the dimwitted among us will rush to say ""of course we know why people cheat on their taxes - they don't want to pay money.""  But that is a pretty dumb answer.  Nobody likes paying their taxes, but most of us still pay them, so it is not a very good explanation.  "

"7553",1460584996,"It's rigged to the degree that the Democrat and Republican parties hold so much influence. They are private organizations and they can run their primaries however they like, or not have primaries at all and just choose their candidate. What is controversial is that the media treats them as the only two parties in existence. All the attention is given to them even though they aren't an official part of the electoral system. Other parties are just as valid, as are independent candidates."
"7554",1460604991,"&gt;The problem for Mr Sanders is that while he's been posting sizeable wins over the past month, they've largely been in delegate-poor states, like Wyoming (14 delegates), Idaho (23) and Alaska (16). His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders.

That does not seem unfair.  Why should Wyoming outweigh Florida?

This is the only evidence they give that the Democratic primaries are rigged.

The main evidence I have seen boils down to this:  ""Bernie is the candidate of the people.  If it were not rigged, he would be winning.""  The idea that most people really prefer Clinton seems to not occur to Sanders supporters.  And they think that people who prefer Clinton are stupid, low information voters who just have not heard the Truth about Sanders.  I feel like I am talking to Jehovah Witnesses sometimes."

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me. I remember how embarrassed I was when I got turned down from a job after being interviewed and hired and then my background check came back and they said my credit was worrisome so they didn't hire me, saying they would be happy to talk to me again when I resolved it all.

The future of the Democratic Party literally depends on whether if the FBI decides it is just negligent or grossly negligent.

"7919",1460556375,"&gt;So why hasn't return-free filing happened yet? The short answer is lobbying, and in particular lobbying by companies like Intuit. In 2013, ProPublica's Liz Day wrote an incredible exposé on just how hard Intuit has lobbied to stop return-free filing from becoming a reality:

&gt;&gt;[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

&gt;&gt;Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

This is the problem.  [Campaign finance is the meta issue; it encompasses all others because every legislative battle today, comes down to money.](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/hillary-clintons-plan-to-reform-campaign-finance-i.html)"
"7920",1460553305,"&gt;The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it's been doing for years.

&gt;Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.

&gt;Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new ""return-free"" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like. Warren isn't the first person to propose this. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) both have similar bills this Congress.

The US tax situation is messed up. I've now filed Dutch, French and US tax returns and the US one is by far the most effort.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

Make filing an amendment in this case cost a little money to discourage procrastination in those who do have changes to make.

He literally brings up how he's going to pay for his proposals in *every single debate*. Clinton? Not so much. ""Closing loopholes"". Well, okay. This is exactly the answer that Romney gave to Obama during the 2012 debates on how his plans wouldn't effect the revenue in a negative way.

When trusts were broken up by the courts under the Sherman Act, correct me if I'm wrong, the companies did the restructuring themselves. His answer was totally spot on, the Federal government says ""that's enough power for you"", not ""here is how we're going to internally change your company"".

That, and all Hilary did was mention she went to places and talked to people - hoping the audience would get caught up in the name dropping. But what's important isn't who she talked to - what's important is the result of those talks. And the results have been bad. "
"8228",1460732583,"Sanders' supporters won't likely listen to criticisms of him.  Unfortunately, this article is right on.  Now, if Sanders' purpose is to fuel his supporters, he more or less was successful at that.  He did what his supporters more or less expected him to do.  But to voters on the fence, his manner came off as being rude and probably condescending.  A lot of snarky remarks and finger pointing won't be perceived positively (let alone directed at a woman) by objective undecided voters.

To me, last night Sanders won when he challenged Clinton to release the transcripts.  She was clearly evasive.  But his sarcastic remarks were a turn off.  Clinton won in portraying herself was someone who could get things done.  Two particular points she made were convincing: one is about the minimum wage (she would sign a $15 minimum wave if the bill was on her desk, but to get there, you couldn't do it in one step) and fracking (her explanation how foreign countries have go to through fracking first before getting to green energy was convincing).

On Israel and Palestinian, I found Sanders' statements very eloquent (he can't explain his position better than that).  Unfortunately, the entire tone came off as not being supportive of Israel as Clinton.  It would win the Palestinian vote in NY.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.

Overall, Sanders' supporters will vote for him. Clinton's supporters will vote for her.  For those people on the edge, I think Clinton did a little better.  I thought Clinton's closing remarks were very effective.  She was very appealing to NYers who voted her to the Senate.  She was asking them and talking to them directly.  If these people vote for her again, Sanders will lose."

&gt;CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process:
“Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturday’s 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.”

The impressive stats Sanders has, in real life, are:

- total # of contributors
- total # of contributors whose total donations per quarter are below $200
- average per-quarter donation
- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

This is also why Hillary pushes for $1 donations, it's specifically so she can cite that one garbage stat."

"8287",1460493080,"But at this point in 2008, Obama was winning and went on to win. Bernie right now is in a significant hole and is unlikely to get out of it.

So there are two possible conclusions: 

1) Bernie isn't that great of a campaigner, compared with Obama. He has more money on hand but can't translate that into votes. Maybe his campaign isn't run as well or isn't as astute as Obama's '08 campaign.

2) Money's influence in politics isn't absolute. Maybe money helps a campaign but can't fix all of a candidate's hurdles.

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

&gt;Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

&gt;Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

&gt;Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

&gt;Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

&gt;Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.

"8361",1460499138,"&gt;“Here’s what I want you to know: Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state,” Mrs. Clinton said at the Port Washington forum. “And the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.”

Hillary cited an irrelevant statistic in order to deliberately deceive the electorate and smear Sanders.  

The only numbers that matter here are 55 and 0.7 percent.  In 2014, only 55 guns migrated to New York from Vermont, which is 0.7 percent of the aggregate from all sources.

"8433",1460578842,"From Verizon's 10K:

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel Transaction. The 2014 effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership prior to the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

So even if you don't want to believe Verizon's press release which is an appropriate assumption, their filing is audited by a third party and signed off by CEO and CFO under the threat of jail for its not accurate. They don't mess around with SEC filings. "

&gt;Bertha Oliva compared the current situation to the early 1980s, when the CIA funded, armed, and trained Honduran government death squads that murdered hundreds of opposition activists.

and:
&gt;“When we first began in 1982, we faced death squads,” said Oliva, also speaking through a translator. “Now, it’s like going back to the past. We know there are death squads in Honduras.”

also:
&gt;The coup was accompanied by a huge rise in political violence. By 2012, state security forces had assassinated more than 300 people, and 34 members of the opposition and 13 journalists had disappeared, according to data compiled by Honduran human rights organizations. The political assassinations added to the emboldened violence from gangs and drug traffickers, making Honduras one of the most dangerous countries in the world. In 2012, Reuters reported that it had the highest murder rate of any country.

&gt;Although the murder rate has since declined, political violence in Honduras has continued. Since the end of 2012, at least 22 prominent environmental activists have been killed, according to Global Witness.

"8583",1460640210,"&gt;But I was struck, in our conversation, by the frequency with which Carter framed today's world within those same dynamics that had preoccupied his early career: great power rivalries, nuclear weapons, and the power of deterrence to keep the world in line.

&gt;It's not that he's unconcerned with terrorism or rogue states, both of which he discussed at length. But he clearly drew from his experiences in the 1980s and '90s an acute sensitivity to the world-shaking stakes of great power rivalries, and a firm belief in the role that deterrence and nuclear weapons still play.

&gt;Carter described a world where not just American power but also global peace and stability will be increasingly challenged by other powers. He returned over and over to the same answer to this problem: the power of deterrence, backed up by overwhelming American superiority and, ultimately, by nuclear weapons.

&gt;But deterrence works on decades-old understandings of warfare that are, today, rapidly changing. As countries develop new tools and techniques of war, Carter warned that deterrence, the foundation on which American power and global stability are built, needs to change as well.

&gt;That is not a challenge that grabs as many headlines as terrorism or rogue states. But the stakes — the international order as know it, 70 years of peace between the major powers, and the thousands of nuclear warheads backing it up — could not be higher.

The pollutants generated from the mass manufacture of solar panels can also be pretty nasty and harmful to the environment, though it's getting better all the time. 

Additionally, the fundamental piece missing from renewables is you can't control them to work when you want.  In a 100% renewable generation profile, where will your power come from in the middle of the night when the wind isn't blowing. You can't make it blow, and can't make the sun shine.

Put more simply, if it's not windy, you need to have enough fossil fuel plants to serve the full public demand.   

Therefore, whatever the cost of wind is, it is almost entirely in addition to the cost of fossil fuel power generation.   The only savings is that when supplying wind power you save on the coal/gas/oil you would have been burning, but you still have to pay for the plant while it sits idle (or runs at less output).

I can understand that she has a fine line to tread between the businesses and people backing her, but, ""Of the People, by the People, for the People,"" should always be the tie-breaker when that conflict arises, bottom line.

"8669",1460473907,"There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

This whole scheme - including this very article - seems geared toward privatizing education via ""charter schools"" - basically private schools using public dollars, the holy grail of crony capitalism. "
"8670",1460472675,"Interesting last paragraph.

&gt;Bill Clinton framed his wife’s position in remarkable terms: “She thinks [the tests] are just too much, that it’s national overreach,” he said, “and the most it could ever do is to help people at the very bottom levels of achievement.” Turn that last passage over in your head and consider its meaning: The most it could ever do is to help people at the very bottom levels of achievement. As if helping people at the bottom is so insignificant that it’s not worth doing. What a thing for a Democrat to say!

"
"8671",1460482222,"So what I get from the article is that Clinton isn't in favor of a standardized test every year and that money would be better spent training and paying teachers.

&gt;""The idea of having to give a national test every year for five years in a row for people from the third to the eighth grade doesn’t make as much sense as investing the same amount of money in helping the teachers to be better teachers.""

She's such a fucking monster."

"8674",1460489706,"For those of you who are genuinely interested on Clinton's position on standardized testing, she sat down with the Editorial Board of Newsday (Newsday is the major Long Island, New York paper and the center of opposition to standardized testing in New York is Long Island) yesterday and gave a lengthy answer on the subject as well as answering several follow-ups.

http://www.newsday.com/opinion/hillary-clinton-at-newsday-long-island-transcript-1.11680010

Newsday's website is subscription only, but I will post as much as I think I safely can under the doctrine of fair use:

&gt;Filler: So, New York and Long Island don't just lead the country in property taxes, that's not our only calling card. We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

&gt;Clinton: Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-à-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime. It was very upsetting to everybody.

&gt;Filler:So you wouldn't say don't do it, you would say do it right.

&gt;Clinton:Do it right. Do it right and I would say I think we need better and fewer tests that are used for what tests should be used for, first and foremost as to how to improve the educational outcomes for individual children, for classes of children, and for schools of children.

&gt;Filler: Should they be used at all to determine whether teachers are being successful?

&gt;Clinton: I think given the state of where testing is right now, I don't think they're good enough to make that determination."
"8675",1460483928,"Hang on let me get this straight -- because the headline reads as a line of attack on Hillary Clinton, Redditors are now going to come out in favor of *more standardized testing*??

"8677",1460475136,"Yeah, this is a good thing. Sorry, but the amount of emphasis placed on testing in the current environment is ridiculous. Kids aren't actually learning anything except how to cram names and dates into their head for one time usage on a test. 

This may actually be one of the first times I've seen the national testing agenda cast as sound progressive policy. A few years ago progressives were falling all over themselves to condemn No Child Left Behind and the emphasis it placed on national testing. Now Clinton's education stance is anti-progressive for opposing the testing culture?"
"8678",1460486343,"If you buy the suspect premise of the article that Hillary's refusal to condemn New York's massive (and [massively popular](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/12/nyregion/the-growing-strength-of-new-yorks-opt-out-movement-maps.html?_r=1)) standardized testing ""opt-out"" movement is the equivalent of ""abandoning education reform"" then you should probably know that Sanders has similarly refused to condemn the opt-out movement and has a lengthy history of opposition to standardized testing with language that mirrors the New York opt-outs' own criticisims of the practice:

&gt;I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001, and continue to oppose the bill's reliance on ***high-stakes standardized testing*** to direct draconian interventions. In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on ***standardized testing***, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.

http://www.aft.org/election2016/candidate-questionnaire-bernie-sanders#sthash.8IqrvlNW.dpuf

It doesn't really matter in either case because, like millions of New York parents, both Clinton and Sanders can obviously be concerned about education reform and still be against standardized testing as currently implemented.

"8681",1460504821,"Its ridiculous that the euphemism ""school reform"" can be said unironically by liberal commentators.

"8682",1460491138,"There are 2 actual education reforms that would work, and we're unwilling to implement them: racial and economic integration, and low student-to-teacher ratios.

What gets called ""education reform"" in this country is actually a movement to privatize public schooling and to spend public money on private schools, while continuing to subject the poorest students to the least-funded educational conditions. If Clinton is truly abandoning the privatization movement, I say good."
"8683",1460497578,"Any article that doesn't put a huge asterisk or quotes around ""reform"" in education, not to mention ""accountability,"" is not all that credible.

"8686",1460507334,"It is for all of these reasons stated below that in Europe, they have different levels of high school; tracking not only classes but entire schools. The reality is that you can't teach students that have such a range of ability level. It is just as ridiculous to expect a low achieving students to be able to do the same as a high achieving student ( or intelligent, a word you may never use in the educational system as eveeybody is the same apparently) as it is to expect a 5ft 60lbs girl to wrestle a 6ft 200lbs guy and be competitive. People are limited by their abilities; a good teacher, like a sports coach may have a 10% impact but it can't make a weak student strong. It is ridiculous to hold teachers or schools  accountable for the grades of their students. At our school, we have a large number of immigrants who barely speak english. Their score count the same as those of native speakers. It is all part of the American notion that everybody can achieve anything as long as they work hard. This is high,y naive: students can reach the goals they set for themselves, based on their interests and ability by working hard.
The downside of the European system is that it creates a class society where people at a young age are labeled and start acting and oerforming accordingly. Also, the level of the teachers at the lower level schools is lower because frankly most teachers don't want to work there, because of the behavioral issues. The other downside is that it is negatively biased towards boys, who tend to be behind in development and organizational skills, compared to their female peers. I know tons of freshmen that would have been put in the lower level schools because they can't even bring a pencil with them, who turned out responsible and dilligent seniors a few years later. 
Both systems have their challenges and both do a disservice to large secrion of the student body."
"8687",1460476300,"Education reform is and has been a shitbasket. Not to say the current system isn't in need of reform, but the reform that was being peddled was and is bad. Do you want a system where teachers are mearly administrators of the material, or where kids sit in front of computers all day using rigid learning programs with minimal teacher interaction? 

Reform usually comes in the form of busting teacher unions. How is the system going to get better if the focus is on reducing the number of teachers and reducing pay. "
"8688",1460476728,"do you people even know what Bernie's stance on education is? Not that I blame you, because he doesn't give a shit about k-12 education, but they are the EXACT same priorities that Clinton says in this article."

A large percentage of the guys I dealt with were in charge of purchasing while they were in, then by some crazy coincidence, after making terrible deals that cost taxpayers millions they got cushy jobs at the same venders they made the orders with. 

This made it especially disgusting for me when the military had their budget reduced, and their immediate reaction was to cut tuition assistance for servicemen. Instead of doing anything to stop these terrible deals that cost us millions for the exact same product, they instead held our military members hostage, stopping them from attending college that gave us better service members while they were in, and gave them better capabilities when they got out so they wouldn't have to rely on government assistance.

&gt; Bunnatine (Bunny) H. Greenhouse is a former chief contracting officer Senior Executive Service (Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. On June 27, 2005, she testified to a Congressional panel, alleging specific instances of waste, fraud, and other abuses and irregularities by Halliburton with regard to its operations in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. She described one of the Halliburton contracts (secret, no-bid contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR)—a subsidiary of Halliburton) as ""the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career"".[1]

&gt; A long-time government employee, Greenhouse was hired by Lieutenant General Joe Ballard in 1997 to oversee contracts at the Army Corps of Engineers. After Ballard retired in 2000, Greenhouse's performance reviews, which had been exemplary throughout her public career, suddenly soured. Greenhouse filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint alleging race and gender discrimination, which her attorney states has never been investigated. In August 2005, she was demoted in what her lawyer called an ""obvious reprisal"" for her revelations about the Halliburton contracts.[2][3]

&gt; Vermont is the safest state in the country, with a violent crime rate of just 115 incidents per 100,000 residents. The state also led the nation in nominal terms, with a total of only 720 violent crimes reported in 2013. Violent crime in the state has also fallen dramatically. Vermont’s violent crime rate fell 19.2% in 2013 from 2012, the largest improvement in the country. **As in other safe states, Vermont’s relatively well-educated population may have contributed to its low crime rates**. Nearly 36% of adults had attained at least a bachelor’s degree as of last year, and 91.5% had completed at least high school, both among the highest rates nationwide."

The real crime is that anyone listens to anything any Democrat has to say on firearms and firearms policy. As a matter of course, the standard assumption is that everything they say is dishonest or at best a half-truth. Sadly, this is not a hyperbolic statement or exaggeration in any way. Which is especially frustrating because there are so many very knowledgeable people who know law, Constitution, research studies, and history, who can accurately discuss public policy and even societal root causes. Heck, a huge number of laymen know the subject matter far, far better than most Democrats attempting to make public policy and law. Take time to ponder that.

To give you an idea of how completely backwards political arena is on firearms, consider the following. When people want expert opinion, they go to experts. When Democrats want expert opinion on firearms and policy, they go to politicians. Which is painfully obvious why, as the experts contradict just about everything Democrat politicians have to say on the subject. Which brings us full circle to my opening sentence.

"8858",1460477183,"So Vermont definitely has issues with guns leaving their state illegally. This wasn't a very strong attack because it doesn't apply to New York in the same numbers. But Vermont is *per-capita* responsible for the most guns recovered in other states in general. 

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-vermont-guns-responsible-for-new-york-violence/

&gt;Her statistics come from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issued a report in 2013 saying **Vermont was in fact, adjusted for population, the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states.** That year, 23.5 guns per 100,000 residents, or a total of 147, were recovered in crimes committed outside of Vermont. The next-highest per capita state was New Hampshire, with 22.3 guns per 100,000 residents.

&gt;An ATF report from 2014 put Vermont in the top 15 states whose guns were recovered in New York. Still, it's worth noting that guns from Vermont are just a tiny fraction of the overall number of out-of-state guns recovered there: that year, Vermont's guns were 55 of the total 4,585 out-of-state guns. In the same year Georgia was the source for 386 out-of-state guns and 395 were traced to Virginia.

Here is her quote- ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest **per capita** number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""

So she was wrong about the New York part. But it is true that per- capita, Vermont is the number one source of guns recovered in other states. Which doesn't sound good, but obviously there aren't very many people in Vermont. "

It's so incredibly fucked up that the media will just listen to these facts and agree that it is indicative of her claim without any follow up questions.

As it turns out, *New York* is the state's leading source of illegal guns.  And using a per capita measure is like comparing sourced guns to the number of cattle in a state, or its milk production, or the miles of railroad track.  It's an arbitrary statistic that has no bearing on the number of illegal firearms that enter from out-of-state.

&gt; The fact that Kelly and Band were laying the groundwork for their enterprise while Kelly was working for the State Department, reported here for the first time, represents a fresh illustration of the blurring of the lines between Hillary Clinton’s political network and her State Department that critics have long noted. **And it shows how one enterprising fundraiser was able to insinuate himself into Clinton's inner circle and then built a 500-person, multinational consulting firm whose value, at least at first, was greatly enhanced by its founders’ closeness to the Clintons.**

They also said a key element of Kelly and Band’s pitch to new clients was donating to the foundation or joining CGI to “raise your leadership profile.”

For those to lazy to look for that I've also went and actually just grabbed the slide that relates to this argument, which can be found [here](http://imgur.com/ZND9rZN).

From this you can see almost as many guns come from California as do from VT... which is over 2438 miles away as apposed to VT which borders the state of NY.  Almost 7 times as many guns make it to NY from PA as from VT.

As a fun way to show that Hillary Clinton is just making fun data stats into pretend causality correlation, I've done the math that shows on the east coast states with lower total cow populations actually had less guns that were used in NY.

Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont. So this is not, ‘Oh I live in a rural state we don’t have any of these problems.’ This is, you know what, it’s easy to cross borders. Criminals, domestic abusers, traffickers, people who are dangerously ill, they cross borders too. And sometimes they do it to get the guns they use.”

Replace guns with illegal immigrants and Vermont with Mexico and we have a Donald Trump quote. And here we have the MSM being completely okay not fact checking this bullshit. It's not even worth mentioning how she lies, we should just call her Ms. Trump. 

So what now, Hillary. Do we build a wall between Vermont and New York to keep out these ""Criminals, domestic abusers, traffickers, people who are dangerously ill""? Please, I wish to know who will pay for it. "

Some argue that big names such as Clinton are not persuaded by money due to their enormous influence and already established wealth, but this is very much *not* true for lesser known politicians. If anything, giving politicians and the democratic party MORE money from such groups is exacerbating an already existing problem. They will be knocking on doors for favors once elections are done.

Also, why do you think doing the same strategy of fundraising that's lost us both sides of congress, as well as numerous gubernatorial and legislative branches across the nation, will suddenly start to win? There is a massive progressive movement that has begun, made up of millions of people OUTSIDE the party and young people who don't typically vote. If the Democrats could harness that energy, and seal up up these votes in elections, that in itself would lend enormous power to taking back Congress. 

Some people mock Sanders for putting his need of getting things done in Congress partially on this movement, but the fact of the matter is that without it and regardless of who is in the White House, we can assure ourselves that a repeat of obstructionism we've seen for the last several years will continue. Democrats suck at getting people to vote for them at lower level elections, how does  doing the same exact thing we did before change that?"

Meanwhile, Sanders is virtually running his platform off of small-scale donations, and for that matter (relatively speaking) out-raising Hillary. 
We seriously need to get large-scale corporate money out of politics. Besides, if politicians hate fundraising so much, then shouldn't they be for this type of action? They say we live in a democratic system, so then why not go all the way and only allow for grassroots donations. This would reduce corruption and allow for a more democratic system where the peoples' contributions seriously impact how an election will go for politicians.

How many different videos and polls showing us this have we seen, yet we chime in that there is an inherent wisdom to the ebb and flow of the tides of ignorance in selecting political candidates.  

We need a better media, one that actually reports on what happens that viewers would be concerned about, that viewers would use as a cause to modify their perceptions and behavior.  It's so important that the first amendment of the US Constitution protects this institution from state usurpation.  The interests of big business have taken it over and so often don't want us to get the very kind of information we need most, because it would modify our perceptions and behavior to be against the interests of big business owners.

&gt;The reality is that Clinton’s plan would barely scratch the surface of the issue. Her proposals are aimed at Citizens United, but as we established, that’s a small piece to a much larger problem. If the Democratic front-runner got her way, corporations would have to disclose their political donations. However, the heart of the matter is far more complex. Her plan doesn’t change that money is speech, nor does it involve tightening the rules of what constitutes “social welfare.” It does not do anything towards regulating 501c4 nonprofits, which would still be able to hide their donors. “Issue advocacy” would still be largely unchecked. Like in the example I gave above, wealthy individuals like the Koch Brothers, who are corporate interests, would still be able to run political “issue” ads through nonprofits with benign names, hiding their identities while pushing a corporate agenda.

&gt; The hard truth for those who would outlaw abortion is that no one really wants to see mom or sis (or the other 700,000 women who have an abortion each year) in the dock. Three in 10 women in the U.S. will have an abortion during their reproductive years, so while many people think they don’t know anyone who has had an abortion, the numbers suggest that probably isn’t the case.

This number is too high. We have to make birth control management better. We need to innovate it. This number is high because American women are not being responsible with birth control. "

""The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed"".  of course if something was made illegal then the law should be enforced.

Bernie really wants to tackle green energy and by tomorrow. He'd probably ask for some green tech from Martian green men if he had the chance. And he would not let green leaves get in the way of true progress! Although he would allow people to smoke their own green leaves in peace.

They want to encourage companies to grow rather than just give the money to shareholders. Shareholders like this because it increases the value of the company and boosts their share value (which gets taxed when they sell). Without that it would be more likely that companies would pay out the money as dividends and cut back on buying new equipment or expanding.

So Bernie's plan is to tax the private sector so they can pay for the government to employ more people? Because if he thinks that will help non-government agencies hire more people, he's fucking retarded. 

Bernie is full of shit. Verizon pays no taxes? Oh you mean 15 billion Bernie? He lumps rich people and corporations into one category, when they are completely different. Corporations employ tons of people. What do you think will happen if we tax them more? Not to mention, several corporations operate at a loss or break even. Masses of people on reddit do not understand the difference in taxation between people and corporations nor do they understand the need for corporations to hire people. Corporations pay payroll tax. They pay income tax, they pay social security tax, they pay taxes in other countries, and the most important part? They employ people and provide them a way to put food on their tables. Jesus. This shit is unbelievable. "

"9591",1460733331,"&gt;...got out of paying taxes by telling the federal government their earnings were just making up for losses in past years.

Okay... well my bottom line took quite a hit since I got a mortgage 3 years ago, so why am I paying taxes? How do I go about incorporating my household?

I don't understand where these arbitrary differences and categories come from. I fully understand that much of that is simply my ignorance of the complicated laws and regulations that govern this stuff, but at the end of the day I'm not sure that can account for the grave injustice our tax system currently delivers to the average person in this country.

I'm sure there's some fancy-pants economists' answer as to why business need to be treated specially, but I'm not sure I care. ""Society needs these businesses to keep the economy alive."" Okay, and society needs middle class people to be able to afford to live too, so why do we see a higher value in the well-being of a corporation than we do in the well-being of a household? (Excepting the obvious increased impact of the failure of a corporation when compared to personal bankruptcy. My claim here is that what we have today is not valued proportionately.)

Businesses don't need help. They live and die by demand. If there is demand and they go bankrupt then they are mismanaging their business. Households need help, households need support. The demand for stable households is far more abstract than the instant gratification of being able to spend $10.00 on an App in Apple's store so they can take $3.33 of that, and so that the developer who actually made the fucking thing might get a penny. Millions (Billions?) of people wanted Apple to make an phone that integrated into all of Apple's other services. How many people asked me to start a family? How many would if we could actually appreciate the consequences of that choice; if it were as simple as the last line on the page being red or black?

I'm relatively well off. My combined household income is over 100k and we've got about 230k in debt (Mortgage and car) and I'm young-ish still, I think. My wife and are are happy because happy is relative, and a lot of people we know are still living with their parents, but every day my wife has to leave our daughter and go to work we feel like slaves to a system in which we have no stake or voice.

Today the American dream is to work a third of your life, sleep a third of your life, have strangers raise your kids for you, and then wonder how things got so fucked up -- and it's a fucking nightmare."

""Instead of condemning the figures behind the uprising, suspending support to the illegitimate government of Zelaya’s successor, Roberto Micheletti, and demanding a restoration of the democratically elected Zelaya, Secretary Clinton decided to move on. In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region “to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.” The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya’s ouster.""

... but most crushingly... she predicted her death and was fearful then for her life (before getting assassinated by the coup heirs to power in Honduras).

It would reveal that the massive campaign and super-PAC contributions Clinton has received from Wall Street did indeed, as Sanders has alleged, influence her ability to get tough on Wall Street malfeasance either in Congress or behind closed doors.

I say this as someone who agrees more with the green party's platform than the democratic party's platform. I'd love to vote green, but I'll only do so if it will actually accomplish something! Being principled and voting your conscience are only things that you do to make yourself feel good. I know nobody likes to be told how to vote, but in my opinion, the most noble thing to do is vote with the idea of civic duty in mind, and cast the vote that's going to do the most good for the country.

I'm really pulling for Bernie, and I've given him a lot of money and volunteered my time phone banking for him. But if Hillary ends up being the democratic nominee, you bet your ass I'll be sucking it up and casting my vote for her.

I use that example because normally a liberal desires *complete equality* and the only way to gain parity for the cannabis issue is to remove cannabis as a Scheduled drug **at all**.

"9741",1460728258,"*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton’s decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "

Sorry but when you are a president you are supposed to be the leader and others should follow you and not the other way around. This is something I miss in Hillary. She hardly ever takes the initiative and just goes with the flow (also applicable on her stands towards most important progressive topics). 

Another trait of a good leader is taking the blame when it is yours to take and not blame somebody else for the mistakes you made! Yesterday in debate you could clearly see she that she doesn't understand this (she solely blamed Obama for some mistakes she was as much responsible for.

The fact that wages were allowed to stay so low, all while corporate profits and equity markets soared prove there is a problem. If the lowest paid workers among us get paid wages that are below poverty levels. Then every single one us will be paid less. Maybe the price of goods and services would rise with an increase in the minimum wage, but I guarantee that those price increases don't outpace the rise in wages.

There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur."" The only aspect of debate that she excels is in details of foreign policy. She was SoS after all. "

"9808",1460749830,"Hillary Clinton lies and Bernie Sanders tells the truth.  Voters are starting to figure this out (at least the informed voters who don't watch the MSM)."
"9809",1460739546,"I like how the main issue anyone has with Bernie is that he doesn't have a fully laid out plan on how to handle certain situations.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."

His approach to Israel is a breathe of fresh air."
"9854",1460735783,"I like Bernie a lot, but for different reasons than most it seems. I like his principled stances, I like that he isn't taking big money, I like that he is hard on corporations, and that he is really the only candidate that might be able to impact income inequality. I also like his stance on global warming and foreign policy. I like how he treats minorities as equals, I don't hear divisiveness when he discusses their problems. I like his stance on the war on drugs and prison reform and non-violent offenders.

I don't feel like putting in the effort to make a big, coherent post, so here are some scattered thoughts I had from the debate:

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

- What the hell is with Bernie's taxes? There is tons and tons of precedent for candidates releasing all of their taxes. Why is he being so shady about it? His excuses are lame and shouldn't be accepted"

If what Bernie Sanders has accomplished so far is not enough to win him the presidency, then we seriously need to take a look as a society at abolishing the superdelegate system. 

The people's choice is clearly Bernie Sanders, if the establishment has an inbuilt means to overturn the people's choice. Then maybe it is time to fight back against a system that is clearly trying to dictate to the people."

Hillary Clinton gave the most generic non-answer I've ever heard, which spun into something completely unrelated to the question."
"9879",1460740112,"Think of all the things that have been said for the first time in a serious manner which were never really talked about before. The list is actually pretty incredible
Single payer healthcare
Marijuana decriminalization
Ending the drug war
Breaking up the big banks
Israel commits disproportionate violence and we should treat both sides with respect 
Campaign contribution corrupt politicians
Overthrowing regimes in ME and Latin America has lead to mass instability in these regions
Our defense budget is too high
College education should be heavily subsidized by the government
15 minimum wage
Spoken out against NSA surveillance and warrentless data collection
Condemned large corporations for not paying taxes
Gone against free trade policies
Talking about the consequences and mistakes of the Iraq war
Talking about mass incarceration and criminal justice reform

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window. I highly doubt that a candidate like Clinton will be elected again, but who knows

"9914",1460696103,"Heres the thing about Hillary. She isnt much worse than any other politician out there. *Everyone* is corrupt. And compared to a lot of the corrupt politicians, Hillary isnt too bad. Thats why she thinks she's justified in not releasing the transcripts. Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change. 

If I could give Hillary one piece of advice, it would be this: Forget about yourself, remember America."
"9915",1460691417,"This debate thrilled me.  The final statements were stunning.  Sanders' final statement felt like history unfolding; that Hillary could not even begin to speak for several moments because of the chanting of Sanders' name, followed by her tepid plea for votes, was just a joy to watch.

What a time.  We could be watching serious history being made, right now."

"9920",1460697704,"I don't think people even give a shit whats on those transcript, the more she avoids it the more curious people are. She went off on a complete tangent, bypassing the question that was asked, and then blamed the republicans. 

Voters are realizing they're hearing the same shit over and over, and it's not a direct answer to the question. Whatever is on those transcript, if they exist at all, at this point doesn't even matter. The fact that she doesn't have a direct answer is a full display of a lack of integrity.

Politics aside, Hilary is a despicable human being. She is everything that's wrong with politics. She embodies all the negative connotation that people associate with the idea of ""the establishment"". I hope she continues to get expose and this effectively end her political career entirely. "

Edit:  It seems like the most common defense is that guns are intended as a person killing device first. Others have pointed out that guns are used in many non-human-killing activities. I'll offer one thing further. Are guns designed to primarily kill people with malicious intent? If a gun manufacturer primarily makes their weapons as a product intended for defense of life and property, does that hurt the ""designed to kill people, therefore culpable"" argument?"
"9929",1460698804,"Hillary talked about the NRA once spending money campaign against Bernie's opponent. You can read the article for the details, but the support was lukewarm for Bernie at best, and the NRA was more motivated by their soured relationship with his opponent.

So that money, 25+ years ago, that wasn't directly in support of Bernie, is evidence of his ""being a reliable supporter of the NRA."" But much bigger amounts of money, in this election cycle, given directly to Hillary campaign and her Super PAC, are not evidence of her being indebted to the fossil fuel industry.

I just wanted to clear that up for everybody."

&gt; This is a stretch. Sanders won his congressional bid about 25 years ago thanks at least in part to the NRA, and has voted against major pieces of gun control legislation. However, he has also cast votes for gun control and has received low marks from the NRA for the past 20 years.

Mostly False, because you know... Context?  I can't seem to stand Politifact anymore.

Young people love personal freedom more than they hate guns.  So it won't rob him of the majority of his liberal base.

What do they think, ""A reliable supporter of..."" means?  Their own research proved specifically that he is not a reliable vote for the NRA, and the NRA agrees based on their grades of Sanders.  If the group that you supposedly support regularly gives you a grade of ""D"" for supporting them, you aren't a reliable supporter.  You aren't even an *unreliable* supporter.  It would be hard to call you a supporter at all.

Call it what it is: Hillary took a few pro-gun lobby votes and twisted it to call Sanders a friend of the NRA.  I'm not what you would call a ""reliable supporter"" of Bernie Sanders, but she lied.  C'mon.  Call a spade a spade."
"9950",1460691683,"I think what she actually proved in the debate is that people who don't care about following the NY gun laws simply got guns elsewhere and brought them to NY. She actually thinks expanding these laws will fix that instead of creating a larger nationwide illegal market.  "

"10040",1460712638,"There are a lot of comments here about how much people don't trust Hillary Clinton. They do trust Bernie Sanders. He has a lot of support with NYT readers. 

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it. 

If he wins the nomination and the presidency it will interesting to see how popular he is a year from now."

Is it likely (definitely possible) that she was paid money for nothing at all? Written off as giving a speech to make it ""legitimate"" but in reality just money paid to Hillary for who knows what reason. 

No hate necessary, just respond what you think.. 

Edit: Some users have pointed out she likely gave an off the cuff, no substance pep talk to the staffers. No transcript. Not actually given the money to do a speech. "

:Takes tin foil hat off:"
"10058",1460703751,"As I posted in another thread,  Were I advising Hillary:

&gt;""No, I won't release the transcripts, and here's why. **Bernie Sanders doesn't care what I said**. Not one bit. He hates that I made the speeches. He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

Yes, it's condescending. Yes,  it's denying some people what they want. But I don't see how her obvious lie and dodge is benefiting her, particularly as she has to repeat it over and over. Just own that you made a great living giving speeches, like frickin Alan Thicke does, and that your private work will remain private. "
"10059",1460707603,"She never will. "

"10062",1460693487,"This is getting pretty late to be releasing his taxes.  How long can it take to have your taxes copied.  Sure, Jane does his taxes.  Does that mean she is the only one able to touch them?"
"10063",1460703012,"You can almost understand what she is saying: *if a left-wing Dem congress put a $15 federal minimum wage bill on her desk*, she would sign it. But she doesn't believe the political will is there, so she won't advocate or fight for it, because that's not ""pragmatic"" or politically viable.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

The Clinton revolution was basically founded on ""New Dems"" newfound role as hippie punchers, so triangulating against a hippie is making Hillary sound increasingly schizophrenic."
"10064",1460692526,"She looked so bad in this answer because it truly seemed like she was trying to mislead people into thinking she's for a $15 federal minimum wage. If that's not what you're for just explain your stance please."
"10065",1460719015,"it seemed like a fairly straight forward answer. Her stance is to push for a federal minimum of $12. If a bill somehow passes for $15, she is more than happy to sign it. 

But the bill she would put forward to congress if there isn't already legislation in the works, is $12"
"10066",1460692438,"Hilary is very confusing and obtuse in her answers."
"10067",1460721331,"Not confusing if you understand how the world works. Same with converting to renewables. You have to make huge changes in phases, otherwise you get very bad side effects.  You can't just jack up minimum wage to 15 everywhere (nor should you as the cost of living in Manhattan and San Francisco is WAY different from places like Alabama and Montana ) immediately without bad consquences."
"10068",1460694201,"At least she gave a long diatribe on why @12 minimum is a step toward $15.  She couldn't give one reason for why she would oppose breaking up big banks.  Instead she refused to answer the question, repeatedly.  Then she claimed that it wasn't ""fair"" to ask her to release her $200,000  Wall St. speech transcripts because the ""other candidate"" won't.  We all know Bernie has no Wall St speeches but she is pretending otherwise. She will say anything no matter how ridiculous to win. "
"10069",1460723100,"You have to be pretty dense to not understand her minimum wage argument. 12 as a baseline and a push for 15 in places that can handle economically. How is that hard?"
"10070",1460705894,"There was nothing confusing about it at all. She's in favor of a federal, nationwide minimum wage of $12. She's in favor of higher minimum wages in states and cities like New York where the cost of living is higher."
"10071",1460709046,"Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"
"10072",1460715245,"I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."
"10073",1460720963,"The answer seems weird but it makes sense when you consider how hard it is to get any legislation to the desk of the president. I'm sure Hillary's first choice would be a $12 national minimum wage, but if congress were to pass a $15 dollar one I'm sure she wouldn't veto it. It makes perfect sense."
"10074",1460725471,"I'm a Bernie supporter, but this is where I agree with Clinton. I believe $12 is a fair minimum wage nationally. Some areas like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco need more. However, I think $15 nationally is too high. Some 15 year old kid in bumfuck Nebraska doesn't need $15 an hour. It could dry up jobs and push automation along faster."
"10075",1460721217,"Minimum wage hikes hurt small businesses. Makes sense that a local place out in the countryside wouldn't have to pay as much, even more so since living in the country is cheaper."
"10076",1460714202,"What's so confusing? It was pretty clear: if you support the $15 min wage, then I support the $15 min wage, if you support the $12 min wage, them I support the $12 min wage.

It's very much in line with the rest of her platform: I support whatever gets me more votes."
"10077",1460701184,"I couldn't believe that she was doubling down on the Fight for 15."
"10078",1460703474,"I'm for whatever will get me nominated."
"10079",1460703907,"She supports a $15 minimum wage in some high cost cities and a lower minimum wage in more rural areas. In any event, she thinks the federal minimum wage should be raised to $12. And if Democrats can somehow get higher than $12 through Congress, she'll happily sign it.

It's only confusing if you're sorta dumb."
"10080",1460704518,"That looks Bernie gives her at 2:20 with the crowd booing."
"10081",1460722401,"In case anybody missed it, here is what the New York State Senate passed:  
&gt;The raise goes into effect gradually, not immediately. In New York City, the wage will **reach $15 in three years**, and four years if a business has fewer than 10 employees. The wage would climb to $**15 on Long Island and in Westchester County in six years.**

&gt;The wage would increase more gradually upstate, hitting **$12.50 in six years.**

&gt;Further increases to $15 upstate would be tied to economic indicators like inflation and set by state budget and labor officials.

In California, the minimum wage increase is as folllows:  
&gt;This latest deal would increase the minimum wage to $10.50 next year, then $11 in 2018, with an increase of $1 every year until it reaches $15 in 2022. 

There are also ""off-ramp"" provisions in case of negative economic conditions, where a scheduled increase would not take place.

I feel like this is pretty much in line with Clinton's stand. It seems from the posts that many people think the minimum wage is just going to shoot up by $7.75 immediately. That's how Sanders makes it sound."
"10082",1460695682,"This is a clear example of HRC displaying her moderate tendencies. She touts herself as a ""progressive that likes to get things done"", but she simply whiffed on her confusing answer. 

Raising the minimum wage to $15 is the one of answers* to the growing welfare problem. If all these people making minimum wage of $7.25/hr and  receiving welfare benefits are making $15/hr, it disqualifies them for many welfare programs.

She did the same shit with her answer about carbon taxing, and a similar thing with her nonanswer about whether Israel's bombing of Gaza was disproportionate (a fair yes or no question).

 She doesn't even want to say clearly what she believes when it's about a divisive issue because any clear answer is bound to piss off some group of people, so she mealy mouths her answers and tries to have it both ways. It's goddamn infuriating to listen to."

There are a few examples of Sanders-aligned House candidates this cycle — such as Zephyr Teachout in New York and Tim Canova in Florida — but in the long run, more congressional, state and local candidates will be needed. 

I look forward to WaPo changing their tune and constantly bashing the ""tea part of the left"" in a few years after this materializes into something real and threatening to incumbent Democrats. Just like they had nice things to say about Bernie until it looked like he actually had a chance to win."

Our job is two-fold, mainly: 

1.) to keep the pressure on and keep talking about these subjects and not let the media push them into the shadows again.
2.) to aggressively challenge any and all voter dis-enfranchisements. Voting should be a constitutional right! Americans should have the right to vote in a fair process free of party corruptions, free of gerrymandering, and free of false choices between 'lesser of two evils'. How to accomplish that technically?

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.  
e.) All states should switch to vote by mail.
f.) Each ballot should have a durable carbon copy record for auditing purposes that shall remain legible at least 10 years in the humid Southeast.
g.) Vote tallying or counting machines must be audited regularly and rigorously using statistical sampling. "

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro–stupid shit?’ ”The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit.

The obstinate stupidity of this man, combined with self righteous indignity, can only lead to disaster. This is a secular country, that was the main attraction early on, even before we called it America. It was a place to escape persecution for being different. Quakers, shakers, puritans, etc. Everyone that was not part of the main church ruled by the king of wherever, was in danger until they escaped their homelands and got here. Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country. Our founders wanted the soldier's, and the king's taxes, out. It was not about establishing a Christian nation. They drank, they whored, they swore. They were men. Normal men.

Ted Cruz however scares me shitless. It would be a step backwards to elect him. We'd have more religious tension discrimination than we already do. Even as a conservative leaning voter, i would never vote for Cruz. I'm economically/fiscally conservative but socially liberal. And Ted Cruz is the exact opposite.

I'm sure he understands that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress aren't exactly his biggest supporters so he would have to somehow appeal to both in order to get anything done.

But the problem is that merely wishing or pointing out how absurd it is does nothing to change it. What does change it is knowing these rules, and then voting in spite of them. The only way these rules will ever change is to know them, follow them, and then vote for candidates who promote something simpler, something more democratic, something more open. The only way voting will *ever* become a national holiday, is if enough voters without a national holiday demand one. Pointing out the flaws isn't enough, nor was it ever enough.

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

&gt;Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, an Argentine and one of Francis’ key advisers at the Vatican, said he was aware of but disputed the perception that the pope disliked the United States. Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said. Francis recently helped negotiate a historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations that has led to restored diplomatic ties between the countries."

The only question here is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs they impose.

&gt;There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.

&gt; The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also won’t explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

&gt; ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

&gt; ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

&gt; Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldn’t get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

&gt; ""As The Lost Angeles Times reported several weeks ago""

Is he trying to be clever? Or is this a typo?  "

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

But they're next, and -- to mix a metaphor -- Clinton's weak showing is the canary in the coal mine."

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "
"10547",1460698052,"because it's a minor protest that barely registers a blip in the history of DC protests?"

Nowadays - who cares. People used to take to the street because doing so made them loud and unavoidably in the way. If I have to do a Google search to even know a protest is happening it's pointless. "
"10558",1460681953,"Maybe because everyone is sick and tired of endless election year protests manufactured to grab headlines in promotion of one progressive cause after another, and the reporters know it? Just a thought."

All he said was that one regulator (Sec Treasury) would determine a bar that defines too big then ""the banks can figure it out"".  This makes it sound like there is one simple metric out there that they can use when it is an enormously complicated issue.  It seems perfectly fair to criticize his answers as vague and lacking details because that is exactly what they are.  I set a pretty high bar on these kinds of statements during elections and this is one topic where I don't think Bernie has done a good enough job of fleshing out his approach.

"10644",1460696073,"$12 was so last debate.  Even the audience was groaning."
"10645",1460736221,"May I ask what the actual justification of a $15 min. wage is? I don't mean whether we should raise the minimum wage, and I agree we should, but what rationale is being used to come up with a specific $15 target at the national level? Do those that support it actually know what the impact would be, or is the assumption simply that however many min. wage earners we have will be the same number who benefit from the min. wage increase? 

If your assumption is the latter, that every min. wage worker will benefit from an increase in the min. wage to $15, might I simply suggest you're making a rather strong assumption. And I don't even necessarily mean with respect to job losses, but with respect to job availability. Raising the min. wage will be no problem for the big boys. Your Wal-marts, Targets, Home Depots etc... will have no problem paying the higher min. wage. Aren't you at least a bit curious why Wal-mart has suddenly grown warm to the idea of an increase? Could it possibly have something to do with the fact that they now have so much market share that paltry increases in costs won't actually result in any decreases in profits, but will likely increase prices at Wal-mart, at least partially offsetting the assumed benefit flowing to min. wage workers after the increase (who shop at Wal-mart already). 

An increase in the minimum wage to $15 nationally would drill many small-to-medium businesses into the ground, after which we'll only have inefficient oligopolists to buy goods from, and then eventually only even more inefficient monopolists. If you care about consumers, then you should be advocating for policies that increase competition in markets. Now again, I support modest increases in the min. wage, handled at the city/state level, as these min. wages will better reflect the highly varied regional economic differences in the U.S. But, we should be wary of large bumps in the min. wage, because at the very least it puts small-to-medium businesses at an even larger cost disadvantage to large firms than they already have. Its very similar to how we handle environmental policy. By having across the board regulations, we put small businesses at a disadvantage by ignoring their cost disadvantage, with the end result being more market power driven to large firms.

We should advocate for policies that induce businesses to pay their low-income employees more while still having a min. wage set at some morally comfortable standard of living. But everything is a trade-off, not the least of which is the efficiency/equity trade off in our macroeconomy. So, while we may feel good about supporting a $15 min. wage because we believe it will benefit all min. wage workers, the outcome isn't at all so clear cut. Most research on min. wage shows that modest increases create modest but negligible job losses. This research doesn't come from right-wingers who hate the min. wage, but objective researchers seeking the TRUE impact of increasing the min. wage. Simply yelling that everyone who is concerned about a $15 min. wage is a corporate shill really just shows a naivete as to the fact that policy has consequences, many of them unintended. "

Whitaker also pointed out that even if Clinton's team manages to avoid conflicting stories or the charge that they exposed classified information, the FBI reportedly opened a potentially more serious investigation into the Clinton Foundation in January.

We know a grand jury has been convened (because they gave Bryan Pagliano immunity). So that means they intend to bring charges against *somebody* and they have enough to convict *somebody*.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

Also, the fact that they're moving SO carefully and SO slowly, and the business with extraditing Guccifer, etc, it seems to me that they would not go to such painstaking lengths and seemingly be walking on eggshells if they were not going after Hillary but merely one of her aides.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.  She doesn't need to go to jail.. they need to revoke her clearance and boot her ass out of any position of responsibility."

Guess what happens go the trust fund when people stop contributing to it?  It dries up, and the money that used to be there is now invested in the private sector.  (And if you invested poorly, enjoy eating cat food in your golden years.)

Why does Politifact seem so eager to go through the tortured exercise of calling this ""Mostly False""?

In five out of the seven years, the median salaries were slightly lower for women without Clinton’s salary included. But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

"11103",1460711369,"Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

"11141",1460711369,"Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

It is Democrats who refuse to simplify the tax code while bitching and moaning that corporations pay no taxes... they need the wedge issue to whip the rank and file left in an outraged lather...

The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.

I pretended not to be registered and looked over the form and sure enough ""Republican"" was checked off on all of the forms in their possession. I told them then that I was already registered as an independent, that party affiliation was NOT required to vote and that these people were obviously lying, and I said it loudly enough that everyone around could hear me. They got up and walked away immediately. I found a campus security officer close by and told them that the people were scamming students and they told me there was nothing they could or would do about it.

"11341",1460653839,"Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman have written an [article](http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/36110-focus-is-the-2016-election-already-being-stripped-a-flipped) on the subject entitled, ""Is the 2016 Election Already Being Stripped &amp; Flipped?"", which is worth the read.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues."
"11342",1460657018,"Ok here's the thing. I believe this happened to me as well n the AZ primary. I'm not sure how to get the hard copy of the change but I may look into it. Anyways in order for this to be a conspiracy the change would have to benefit someone. I just don't see how anyone could benefit with certainty. Sure you could say Hillary benefited from me not being able to vote. But no one would have any idea if I was going to vote for Hillary of Bernie. It would be a crap shoot as to which vote got nullified. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have to error more on the side that this more of a database type problem. I saw tons of people in line with me that experienced that same issue. Seeing forged names looks suspicious but how could you possibly determine who could benefit from an affiliation change. Hell I'm not even in the under 40 group."

"11349",1460647058,"In NJ my wife and I both changed our registration to Dem to make sure we would be good to vote for Bernie in June. My registration change went through no problem, hers - not so much. She's listed as an independent even though she's positive she was a dem before hand. FYI she filled out the change registration forms at my request ""just to be sure"" even though she was sure she didn't need to. Luckily for her, you can change from independent to Dem in NJ on the day of the primaries"
"11350",1460666236,"Well if we can't have a fair and accurate primary, then we should just start focusing on the general election now. Bernie should just tell the DNC to go climb a tree, since they are incapable of running anything close to a fair election, and he should start running as an Independent (for Democracy sake). He has all the attention and momentum now. He shouldn't allow this charade to coronate Hillary first."

"11357",1460665930,"The voting process is so fucking retarded in the US.

Here in Sweden, you get a unique voter form mailed to you, but it's possible to vote even without them. It's just easier with them. Then you go to your designated polling office, vote locally, regionally and nationally by choosing the party you want to vote for (we have a bunch) and showing a valid photo ID, like a drivers license or a passport. Then every vote is recounted and the voting records with matching IDs are checked. There's no voter fraud and there's no need to register beforehand. Oh yeah, and we don't deny people the right to vote just because they've had trouble with the law before.

Local, regional and national parliaments are then divided based on the corresponding voter percentages. No first past the post shit. No gerrymandering shit. No electoral college shit. It's basic and it works because it's damn hard to corrupt it. 

The US voting system is a laughing stock."

"11360",1460650094,"It's entirely possible this is Republican activists trying to push Voter ID laws.

Roosevelt, with Butler as leader of that organization. In 1934, Butler testified before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the ""McCormack-Dickstein Committee"") on these claims.[1] No one was prosecuted.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot)

To help minimize future firearm-related deaths, President Obama issued 23 executive orders directing federal agencies to improve knowledge of the causes of firearm violence... One of these executive orders, Action #14, noted that “in addition to being a law enforcement challenge, gun violence is also a serious public health issue that affects thousands of individuals, families, and communities across the Nation” (White House, 2013b). This order directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other relevant federal agencies, to immediately begin identifying the most pressing research problems in firearm-related violence with the greatest potential for broad public health impact...""

The problem is Bernie doesn't want to fully hang the albatross around Hillary's neck, perhaps in deference to the fact that she is likely to be the nominee and will need progressives' support in the general. 

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

Everyone in the establishment is warning that Bernie had better be careful and not do anything to permanently damage Hillary. But you KNOW if Bernie were leading Hillary would do everything she could to permanently damage Bernie without hesitation, because all she cares about is winning, despite her claims to the contrary. And nobody in the establishment would come to Bernie's defense and say ""hey back off don't destroy our potential nominee."" And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

But I've asked this before and still not received a clear answer; what exactly have Hillary's donors received from her in terms of specific consideration in her platform, that is otherwise inconsistent from a position she might reasonably hold in the absence of their influence?

Edit: the most consistent retort to this notion I've heard is that Hillary is lying in her platform. That needs to be called what it is: a conspiracy theory based on an assessment of her character, and not evidence - circumstantial or otherwise - of corruption or cronyism."
"11528",1460642616,"Our American parties want it both ways: they want the legitimacy of a public election process (primary or caucus) to bolster their candidate's chances in the general election, but the party elites also want to maintain *total control* of who gets chosen as the candidate.  Americans have called ""shenanigans"" on this in both parties, this election.

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.  

Both conventions this year will be hotly contested.  We'll see delegates switching, terrible accusations being made, etc. But what we'll mainly see is a question of ""Who is the Party?  Is it the people who register and vote for that Party?  Or is it the few wealthy elites behind the scenes that are the Party?""

"11534",1460652034,"I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;After all that, Black came to the conclusion that “capitalism works better if we don’t have a class of banks who take all the reward and none of the risk.” And like Ryan, he thinks the fallout of that disparity is written all over New York city.

&gt;Mr. Cruz has toured the country bragging about his voterless victory in Colorado. For a man who styles himself as a warrior against the establishment (you wouldn’t know it from his list of donors and endorsers), you’d think he would be demanding a vote for Coloradans. Instead, Mr. Cruz is celebrating their disenfranchisement.

Trump is right here, everyone should be pissed at this. Trump was favored heavily in Colorado  but they canceled the vote and then locked his delegates out of the building so they couldn't vote for him. Disgusting. "

Screw long lines, former Presidents campaigning, skewing delegates or underselling a lead.  Republicans in Colorado were *literally* not allowed to vote, at all.  They did not have a say in who their state wanted the Republican nominee to be.  That is undeniable voter suppression in the most literal sense of the phrase, and regardless of who you support we as a country cannot stand for this."

This effectively disenfranchises voters in closed primaries.  Voters need to print out their registration confirmation and verify their registration.  If they see something wrong, they need to contact the authorities in each state and make a huge scandal about this.  I believe there is already a lawsuit being prepared in NY because the problem is so widespread."

Before throwing the baby out with the bathwater, it would be great if people would actually get to know the process in their state before suggesting just scrapping it.  It's annoying that Trump and Bernie supporters are throwing flaming fits because they didn't bother to figure out the rules of the game while other candidates did.  Not that I wouldn't like reform in my home state for the stuff that should be changed in both party's systems but it's not all evil cause there has to be a structure to select candidates.
 
TLDR; The Colorado election process is a complex game best played by people who understand the rules.  Trump didn't figure them out but Cruz did.  I'm a Democrat, I have no skin in the Republican's game so I'm not defending them. I'm also not arguing either party has a great process, both need reform but they're not rigged here.

The math already does not work, and the math will basically be pretty damn solid after the 19th if he doesn't come away with a considerable delegate pull.

"11825",1460630066,"My takeaway from the primaries -

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

See the FCIC testimonies of [Gary Gorton](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15787) and [Ben Bernanke](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm) as a starting point. Then read up on any serious research done by [central banks](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr506.pdf), government agencies (like [the OFR](https://financialresearch.gov/briefs/files/OFRbr-2015-03-repo-sec-lending.pdf)) and finance academics.

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

"11878",1460660389,"Why won't she support Bernie if she actually cares so much???"
"11879",1460646328,"&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

&gt; The saga continues.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

The geographical makeup of the country also gives an unfair advantage to populated areas.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;&gt;    a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

&gt;Really, we should do both. Politically, we'll do neither.

"12354",1460744196,"This column encapsulates Reddit, /r/politics, and /r/SandersforPresident in a nutshell:

&gt;What you see, on this as on multiple issues, is the casual adoption, with no visible effort to check the premises, of a story line that sounds good. It’s all about the big banks; single-payer is there for the taking if only we want it; government spending will yield huge payoffs — not the more modest payoffs conventional Keynesian analysis suggests; Republican support will vanish if we take on corporate media.

&gt;In each case the story runs into big trouble if you do a bit of homework; if not completely wrong, it needs a lot of qualification. But the all-purpose response to anyone who raises questions is that she or he is a member of the establishment, personally corrupt, etc.. Ad hominem attacks aren’t a final line of defense, they’re argument #1.

&gt;I know some people think that I’m obsessing over trivial policy details, but they’re missing the point. *It’s about an attitude, the sense that righteousness excuses you from the need for hard thinking and that any questioning of the righteous is treason to the cause.* **When you see Sanders supporters going over the top about “corporate whores” and such, you’re not seeing a mysterious intrusion of bad behavior into an idealistic movement; you’re seeing the intolerance that was always just under the surface of the movement, right from the start.**

I started out as neutral. I'm not American and I like to watch American politics from afar because I don't have to get emotionally invested and I don't have to eventually pick a side. But then the Sanders supporters got just so very toxic.

**Sanders supporters, you need to pay attention to this:** Your movement is toxic. You've taken it and tarnished it and smeared shit all over it. You've treated everyone who wasn't a True Believer in Bernie Sanders like a pariah, or like they're an evil paid corporate shill. You've acted like condescending assholes that nobody wants to associate with.

You will look back on this one day and you will cringe with embarrassment. You will get involved more deeply in politics one day and you will realize that your actions helped strangle Bernie Sanders's presidential bid in its cradle. You will look back at this and realize that you acted completely contrary to how people need to act in politics to win supporters.

It's sad this article is getting downvoted, because you need to read it. You guys need to know one of the reasons Bernie is losing and why he will never win."

Sanders isn't going to win a majority of pledged delegates, but Clinton's pledged delegate total won't be an absolute majority either.  So technically the nomination cannot be decided until the superdelegates cast their ballots in July, so all his supporters should keep fighting.

Obviously what actually happens is that the instant the polls close in DC on the final primary (and realistically somewhat before) the horse trading phase of the nomination starts.

I did an analysis of what the delegates totals would be if the South voted today, and if Bernie lost the black vote by 40 points (30-70) Clinton's lead would be about ~115 less, or around 100.  This is assuming he still does a little worse than he has in statess like Missouri, but I think the 30% is a reasonable mark.  

So yes, mathematically it did distort reality.  This isn't to say that the South should be disregarded, it is saying that having the South first as a monolithic block definitely had an impact on the race.

Honestly kind of a bummer about that, they should have set up a screen or something.

Section 2(4) is unimplementable in good conscience. It shows the contempt these politicians have for the constitution and the people.

If this were to become law, any hardware, software and cloud storage provider that provides encryption as a ""feature"" is responsible for the data stored by their users. They MUST decrypt the data if the government so requires. Obviously, it is not possible if the encryption occurs **client side** and the key is in the hands of the user. So, it effectively requires that the providers **deceive** their users, or implement **backdoors**. And once you have a backdoor, there is no way to guarantee that it can only be accessed by the ""good"" guys.

I'm not alone in this ability - damn near every competent IT professional can figure out how to do this.  There are a few well nigh unbreakable encryptions out there that can be used.

Burr and Feinstein should actually talk to someone competent before the make idiots out of themselves.  Well, it's too late for that, I suppose. They seem to live in a fantasy world where strong encryption doesn't actually exist, and/or can only be implemented by the phone companies on behalf of the stupid and incompetent public, where spies and state sponsored terrorists can't figure out how to hire competent IT people or cryptographers.  Technology, apparently, can be kept secret by the government and no one else can figure it out.

Suggested talking points:

* almost all encryption experts think it is a bad idea, and makes it impossible to secure personal, medical, and financial data.

* terrorists and criminals will always have their own encryption, like PGP.   Or use foreign services.  This will affect only ordinary citizens.

* This bill will hurt US industry, and force anybody who incorporates security to move offshore. 

* This bill is extremely invasive: Taken at face value, even the web browser you and I are using may become illegal to distribute, because its authors (covered entities under Section 4(4)) can't decrypt messages it sends [Section 3(a)(2)],  including this message.   This bill requires the authors of a web browser (which can be thousands of un-validated people for open source software) to be able to break into all of your most private personal, banking, and medical communications.

"12590",1460663188,"Just to play devil's advocate, and because I truly don't know the difference.  

How is this different than your landlord being forced to open your apartment if you are suspected of committing a crime?  Or a cop breaking down your door because he has a warrant?  Or your bank being forced to disclose transactions that may be related to criminal activity?

I'm all for privacy, but if you commit a crime don't you forfeit that right to some extent?  Shouldn't we, as a society, have some mechanism for catching criminals and enforcing laws?  Why should we make it easier for the outlaws and scumbags of our society to hide their activity?

I understand the client-side encryption angle, but it seems that at the end of the day providers wouldn't be held liable for users implementing features not offered by their service.  It would be like the government suing the telephone company because I used their phone line to deal drugs.  They can ask for and subpoena call logs, but can't sue the phone company for my behavior.  It doesn't seem to me that a backdoor would be required if user-side encryption is the problem.

It's statistically likely that nothing has changed. I've got to give NBC credit, they at least mentioned the margin of error.

Clinton is in the lead in every single other demographic (however, I'd like to note that the survey doesn't actually ask about any demographic information other than male/female, so I question the legitimacy of any of the demographic differences other than that one).

She wants more wars in her idea of a ""muscular foreign policy"" and her support from practical war criminals like Henry Kissinger. 

Atleast with someone like Trump my Taxes will be lower, business will be easier, and no more cheaper labor to drive down American wages. 

Bernie as president would've been the President who is the LEAST LIKELY to sell us out and screw us over.

NY will be close, Bernie will win, but it'll be nothing but symbolic which will help his momentum into the next elections.  Bernie will win California, and it'll propel him to the nomination.

Now, in regards to the child custody aspect of the bill. Unless there is some significant reason as to why one parent is safer than the other, there is no reason that custody should not be 50/50.

California did this in the 70s and it led to the so-called ""tax revolt era"" where citizens overwhelmingly voted in favor of restrictions on the ability of the state to raise tax revenue from property and business taxes. Result: CA nearly went bankrupt in the 80s and 90s because they couldn't raise taxes to generate new revenue. 

So, while direct democracy sounds great, you have to realize that MOST citizens don't actually know how to run a state/country. This is PRECISELY why our founding fathers set up the U.S. as a republic, not a democracy. "

Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do. As a Bernie supporter, I'd prefer he'd skip the speech, and spend the time campaigning in NY instead."
"12677",1460643856,"He better hope the debate ends right on time. 

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

"12713",1460660064,"&gt; Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job. Let's not make ovaries a requirement of high office--just like we wouldn't make religion or race or whatever. "

&gt;The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

If part of the effect is due to ""Women also tend to leave the workforce for periods to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay, and choose careers that tend to have lower pay."", then we need to look at a way to address this. 

When my child was born, I asked my boss if I could work part-time for six months to help my wife out. I wanted to work a ""90%"" schedule where I could take off every other Friday to give my wife a break (I had used up my vacation for parental leave). He looked at me like I had two heads and told me that the logistics of that were too hard to work out (the company is mid-sized, with over 500 employees). He would not let me do this even though I assured him that I could still do 100% of my duties in 90% of the time.

A number of women had part-time schedules in the company, but they were almost universally looked down upon. So there was not only a different standard in allowing part-time work (women could grudgingly get this, men could not), but there was a different opinion given when this was used.

Of course, the ""corporate"" message is ""yes, you should definitely be penalized, career-wise, if you choose to work less"". That is the assumption that needs to be challenged, because we are all humans, we have parents, we have children, and we wouldn't have much of a society if we make child-rearing a taboo corporate activity."

Many Verizon employees are being placed on emergency work assignment to fill the position of these union members. My mom has had this lingering assignment weighing over her head since these strike talks began. She also had to participate in this same issue in 2011 when the first phase of strikes began.

&gt;The Trans-Pacific Partnership Would Undermine 
Internet Freedom
Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning."

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it. And capital should be taxed the most. Spend it or lose it, once again encouraging consumption."

IE we asked HRC's campaign, and while the only real data we have supports the claim, were going to take their word for it and rate this mostly False.

Also will Sanders Wall Street tax pay for free public college? Well it includes partial state funding (that already exists in part or total), and a conservative estimate only shows it would raise 80-100% of the money needed, and some govenors might reject it (which would result in students by and large leaving the state for free college in less shitty places) so we'll also rate his claim mostly false.

"13194",1460647105,"As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

* Democratic turnout was over 1.86 million voters. (Republican turnout was just under 643,000)
* For further reference that is about 1.5x the voter turnout for Dems in Massachusetts in both 2008 and this year and only slightly more than Rep. voter turnout in Mass this year
* Massachusetts has ~1/3 of New York's population, but has open primaries. This shows either the huge opportunity for either candidate to drive voter turnout on Tuesday, or just how much closed primaries affect turnout, or both.

Hillary Clinton reads a script that includes her direct involvement in the ""CP time"" joke, and decides that is a good idea. After being called out on it she does not apologize, and also shifts the blame to de Blasio.

I feel like the whole concept of a career is completely changing and my generation won't ever see the kind of working environment that generations before us have. Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily. And it makes more sense to me that the 'benefits' be paid for with our taxes rather than out of pocket. Obviously the cost of it is daunting, but I think it will only makes sense moving forward.

"13455",1460574484,"I keep hearing that Bernie's sustained aggressive tactics are a sign that his internal polls are showing him stagnant in New York and he's getting desperate.  And it may very well be the case.

But what if...and this might sound crazy, but...what if in spite of all the people that want to parrot that hand-wringing concern-trolling line of ""What happened to Mister Positive Campaign!?!"", his internal polls are showing that his attacks...*might actually be working*?

As time has gone on, I've become more and more in the Hillary camp, both because of reports like this, but also because I really, really hate Sanders' view that basically all opposition is corruption; I find it not only conspiratorial and wrong, but a really ugly and infectious accusation against good faith opposition.

But ignoring that, I really found this article impactful. Everything I read about Hillary doing her job in government just impresses me. And yeah, she's a truly awful campaigner, but I can't say I care very much.

The one thing that really struck me in here is the line about how when she was campaigning in 2008, she'd go out for speeches and people would hold up signs saying ""Beat the Bitch"". I mean...what the fuck. Was I unaware of this in 2008? Did I just not care? That's like a movie scene - having her go onstage, ready to campaign and be excited about reaching out to people, only to see something like that. It must have been a punch in the gut. Just awful."

"13508",1460613664,"I hear Arkansas exports liars to New York, though."
"13509",1460615853,"Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

**TL/DR: Lies, Damn lies and statistics**"
"13510",1460604171,"Oh. and how many of those guns recovered in New York came from... New York?"

"13517",1460625133,"Did Bernie smuggle all 55 guns?

"13519",1460609468,"She's grasping at straws here. Maybe she should stop trying so damn hard. The lies didn't work in 2008, why does she think they'll work now? &gt;_&gt;"

"13522",1460630868,"People talk about what a brilliant politician she is, but what Clinton really has going for her is epic cynicism. She knows Vermont will never go to her, so she throws this peaceful little state under the bus.

"13528",1460635473,"But what about the ones that weren't recovered? Of the millions of potential unknowns guns they could all be traced back to Bernie Sanders for all we know! "
"13529",1460639795,"Or because the black drug dealers take their drugs up into Vermont, knock up a nice white girl, buy a gun and head back home to New York.

"13534",1460663506,"Don't worry, she told those gun manufacturers to cut it out"
"13535",1460666264,"""you would have a hard time convincing people that the NY crime problem was being exported from Vermont""

.... Ah yeah, no shit! 

Also only 55 guns out of 7,686 recovered were from Vermont.

What is she smoking? "
"13536",1460585710,"Fuck that ugly bitch. On second thought I'll pass."
"13537",1460625630,"almost certainly a meaningless stat, but it's true that per person in VT this small number of 55 is bigger than the others

if this trend held up with other states with lax gun laws, i think that supports her position that it hurts new york that states have these laws"
"13538",1460647795,"Which is the highest % of any state that they could tie the guns to"

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"

"13674",1460625392,"So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".

Mainly the utility poles, trenches and limited usable frequencies that all traverse public space to connect us all together.  It is very similar to our interstates and roadways.  Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

Right now it isn't widely deployed for orders to be made via a screen in a restaurant, but it has been showing up in some places and a higher minimum wage will certainly make more places consider the switch.  If something costs $50k to install and $1k a month to maintain (totally making up numbers) and you're open 12 hours a day 7 days a week then it might not make sense to switch to an automated system if you're paying $8 an hour.

1. What about people whose employers send out W-2s (or other documents) late or with incorrect information? Employers won't like the potential for liability on their part.

When society is conserving energy, turning the lights off above car dealerships for instance, maybe limiting yacht size, then we can talk about drastic means to secure more energy. Until then, Sanders is correct in responding to the science that our energy needs can be met with more sustainable less dangerous less expensive methods."

Insurers won't even think about writing coverage on nuclear power plants, so any issues that arise will make the company insolvent or put the onus on cleaning up or repairing any damage on the taxpayers. I know that nuclear power is generally considered safe, but accidents can and do happen, and by increasing the exposure to that risk we greatly increase our chances of a catastrophic event.

We have worry about attracting non-Democratic voters in the general election, because the Democrats cannot win a general election without them.  Bernie gets far more independent voters and Republican crossover votes, both in general election forecast polls and in open primaries.  That alone makes him the most electable candidate."

Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

I mean, Trump is just a few points less liked than Hillary. And he has momentum, and she does not. He is talking about issues most of America agrees with him on, and Hillary is dragged down by all her baggage. Her campaign is like a very slowly deflating balloon by now. Trump tones it down a notch, acts more presidential once he has secured the nomination and he will end up being more likeable than Hillary."

Bernie Sanders has held elective office for almost all of the last 35 years. He was first elected to Congress in 1990, which was 26 years ago. (Clinton wasn't elected to Congress, her first and only elected office, until 2000, 10 years later.)

Also, the reasons why she has such a high unfavourability rating isn't just because 'over the years ' people have tried to delegitimise her. It's because her politics suck. Who voted for the Iraq war? Who called black people super predators? Who supported Goldwater? Who was against gay marriage until it became popular? That's right, Hillary fucking Clinton.


This article seems to completely ignore these facts, and treat clintons dissaproval ratings as an inevitable outcome of a long career. Bernie has been in politics just as long and there isn't shit you can stack against him in terms of his political record.

Im confused by this. Is she saying poor people will get an additional 10k to match say 10k for a down payment on a house?

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.  

This is all theoretical of course, but its one scenario keep imaging with this situation."

Hook, line, and sinker. Just like the article says, people just ignore the details thinking ""free"" trade must just be a good thing.

Even more, I hate how the conversation is dominated by only talk around $$$. There are environmental concerns, political ramifications, security problems, and even ethical issues. But nobody big on free trade every wants to talk about those."

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!"

This is the problem with WaPo and other MSM outlets today. It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd. It's the constant defeatism and uninspiring approval of the truly meager progress being made that shifts focus away from the biggest problems in today's political landscape, which *are* structural and pervasive, not specific and discrete. How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

The rise of both Sanders *and* Trump is showing us that people are *not* happy with status quo politics or politicians. That the majority of people want *drastic* change, not faux pragmatism that is really leading us nowhere fast.

And that's the important part that needs to be emphasized. SHE has responsibility in this unity, and so do her surrogates and other establishment Democrats.

And what do they do? They actually create an entire campaign against Sanders' supporters, calling them sexists misogynists, branding them with a condescending name. Generalizing them as nothing but young, dumb people who haven't done their research. And even going as far as shaming women who support Bernie Sanders.

And I'm not even talking about small anecdotes, all of these things were committed MULTIPLE times by MULTIPLE people on the Hillary side. This was obviously coordinated strategy.

And why did they do this? Because they didn't enough bad stuff to find on Bernie Sanders.

Hillary Clinton has not done herself or the Democratic Party any favors during this campaign. And if it comes back to bite all Democrats in the ass, you know the reason why."

I have real issues with Hillary and her policies, so I cannot support her. She's flip flopping on issues like Romney did, she talks down to the average citizen with the way she answers questions (""with a cloth?""), she's too war friendly, she doesn't see the issues with the Honduras coup, and more. If her views were closer to mine? Sure, I'd get behind her. But that's not the case, so I won't support her."

She is not entitled to anybody's vote by dint of being a Democrat, nor is she entitled to anybody's vote because it's ""her turn."" The DNC's strategy is to beat Sanders and then lesser-evil fear-monger his supporters into voting for Hillary. **That way she doesn't have to change.**

But this is the power Sanders supporters have over Hillary: If she wins the nomination, she needs to prove she will represent our interests and adjust her policies appropriately. If she doesn't, we can withold our votes. That doesn't mean voting for Trump like an asshole, but you can stay home, or you can write in Sanders as protest. It shouldn't need to come to that, though. The threat of losing should force Hillary to bend. Look at how much of Bernie's platform she's already copied. Hillary is a creature of constant compromise. Instead of allowing ourselves to be badgered into falling in line, we should demand that the Democratic nominee represent the wishes of the electorate. If Hillary wants to be president, she'll need to work for **us.**"

"15158",1460560404,"From the article:

&gt;The administration says the issues of foreign tariffs and of whether the Pentagon should be required to buy shoes made domestically are entirely separate.
&gt;
&gt;Though most of the company’s shoes are made overseas, domestic manufacturing is a big priority for *owner Jim Davis, a longtime Republican donor*.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;LeBretton said a representative for the Obama administration then asked New Balance to accept a compromise version of the trade deal, **partly** in exchange for a pledge of help getting the Department the Defense to expedite the purchase of US-made shoes.

""Partly""? This allegation needs to be a lot more specific to be taken at all seriously. Who exactly is he claiming promised something and who did they promise it to? Does ""partly"" mean the linkage between the trade deal and the military bidding process was inferred? As he also mentions a ""compromise version of the trade deal"" being discussed was this a USTR rep running some potential trade deal changes by someone from the company who was serving on one of the advisory committees? Finally, LeBretton says nothing about anyone being asked not to ""bad-mouth"" the deal -- where does that allegation come from? Or is that just a side-effect of their having signed on to the ""compromise version of the trade deal""?"
"15159",1460583251,"It's a shame that's happening... The actual shoes made in the US by NB (numbers are low honestly, only like 15% of the shoes sold @ NB stores aren't made in South Asia) are actually pretty damn good quality wise.

&gt; That $1.8 billion in relief from Goldman that's supposed to help homeowners in distress? Miller says that in these cases, the terms are kept vague, and Goldman can use that money to do things that are in its best interest anyway, like writing off debt that's obviously not going to be repaid, demolish foreclosed upon houses, and modify mortgages that are in distress.

&gt;""It would be like me agreeing to be right handed all day today or to wake up tomorrow morning and have coffee,"" Miller says of the settlement agreements. ""Those things are going to happen anyway.""

&gt;He also pointed to something critics have called the ""bullshit-to-cash ratio"" as one indicator of how little the penalty will affect a giant like Goldman. Basically, it's important to note that only about $3 billion of the $5 billion will be paid out in cash. On the other hand, about half is tax-deductible and will be placed on the backs of taxpayers––even though the median American family lost about 40 percent of their wealth during the worst stretch of the crisis.

&gt;What's more, the New York Times notes that after incentives and tax credits, Goldman can chop about a billion dollars off the total penalty. According to a chart attached to the settlement, for every dollar Goldman puts into community investment in New York, they get a $2 tax credit."

"15368",1460558485,"Banking Execs: #Too Big Too Jail"
"15369",1460564042,"One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

If anything, he ran to the *right* of Hillary on some issues, such as his rejection of the individual mandate.

Either the 1% are a bunch of sadistic fucks, they actually are manipulating the system but are manipulating it in a way that reddit agrees with, or maybe, just maybe, they don't have as ubiquitous a control over the system as we think, and what control they do have is split among various ideals and positions because they are normal fucking people with different values just like everyone else.

Did CNN ask why Hillary is fundraising in **China** and other countries?

&gt;The presidential campaign for Democrat Hillary Clinton is hosting a number of fundraisers overseas in the coming weeks, despite past issues with money from foreign donors.


&gt;This Friday, while her opponent Bernie Sanders is in the Vatican discussing global poverty with the presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador among others, ex-Goldman Sachs partner Gary Gensler will host a fundraiser for Clinton in Hong Kong.


&gt;That will follow his Wednesday event in Beijing, China looking for campaign cash.

The reason why his 7 state win streak hasn't accounted to a huge change in the race is most of those states are smaller states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming) And the system is rarely a winner take all, and winning by a huge margin in a state worth 20 to 30 delegates isn't worth as much by winning a state worth 300 by the same margin or even a much closer one.  For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

"15526",1460510197,"I have been stalking this election as an outside observer to the US and it really is fascinating to me. I am utterly bemused by the lack of critical analysis of a range of sources and the ability for everyday Americans to draw their own informed and fully justified conclusion.


I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

I am reminded of Sarah Palin's famous quote; ""*FRUIT FLIES!*"""
"15646",1460675176,"Here is the abstract:

&gt;This interdisciplinary research project will advance basic understanding of how tax compliance behavior emerges by focusing on how perceptions of risk and tax fairness form, how these perceptions spread through a social network, and the interplay caused by the complex feedback loops among individual behaviors and population-level outcomes. The project also will address how audit, penalty, and taxation policies, and changes in those policies, influence perceptions and ultimately reduce tax evasion. The project will provide new insights regarding how tax compliance behavior is modified by the perceived aggregated compliance and on how behavior and the perceived aggregated compliance depend on social network structure over which perceptions of taxation spreads. The project will demonstrate the utility of the use of agent-based modeling for research on interactions between individuals and governments as well as how data from the American Life Panel collected by Rand Corporation can be employed to address problems like this. The analysis also will have practical utility, because it will shed light on why certain countries with high taxation levels, such as Scandinavian nations, can maintain high levels of tax compliance while other countries with lower taxation levels may have high levels of tax evasion as is the case in Greece and Italy. Project findings therefore should help nations like the United States reduce the occurrence of tax evasion.

&gt;Income tax evasion is a problem that poses considerable challenges for tax authorities and governments at the local, state, and federal levels. Its causes and implications are both economic and social. The role of tax evasion-related perceptions and how social networks influence those perceptions remain poorly understood, however. The investigators will build an agent-based computational simulation model of income tax evasion. Within the simulation, the compliance behavior of individuals will change through an adaptation process based on their past experiences with audits and tax evasion penalties, their perception of the fairness in taxation rates, and social interactions with people in their social networks. In conjunction, the investigators will conduct a national survey on the perceptions of tax fairness. The survey will gather individual-level data that will inform the simulation model's behavioral mechanisms. These mechanisms influence the propensity to evade, and the survey provides an empirical basis for choosing model-specific parameter values. Model assumptions will further be informed using sensitivity analyses. The simulation model will be validated and calibrated to reproduce U.S. national levels of income tax compliance for different tax brackets. In addition to the U.S., the model also will be calibrated using data sets and compliance levels for Greece and Denmark. Once calibrated, the model will be used to understand how tax evasion behaviors evolve differently depending on various starting assumptions, such as how social networks are structured or what fiscal policies are in place and the conditions for the system to produce tipping point dynamics. The model then will be used to identify fiscal policies that are most effective in minimize tax evasion and recovering compliance. The investigators will employ robust decision making, a method for improving policy decision making, to rank policies based both on their potential performance, as well as how robust this performance is to the key sources of uncertainty. This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.

Of course the dimwitted among us will rush to say ""of course we know why people cheat on their taxes - they don't want to pay money.""  But that is a pretty dumb answer.  Nobody likes paying their taxes, but most of us still pay them, so it is not a very good explanation.  "

But nostalgia for the rotary phone era won’t save American jobs, any more than ignoring the global forces reshaping the auto industry saved the Detroit auto makers.

Business people truly don't understand things like the Social Contract or the common good.  Every thought in their mind is a rationalization for their own greed.

That does not seem unfair.  Why should Wyoming outweigh Florida?

This is the only evidence they give that the Democratic primaries are rigged.

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me. I remember how embarrassed I was when I got turned down from a job after being interviewed and hired and then my background check came back and they said my credit was worrisome so they didn't hire me, saying they would be happy to talk to me again when I resolved it all.

Socialism is great in that it reduces inequality while still allowing for a reasonable amount of inequality to give incentives for people to climb up the social ladder.

Destroying inequality altogether is not the goal. The goal is reducing inequality to a level where the poor are not hundreds of miles below the rich on the social ladder and inescapably stuck at the bottom for life."

"16174",1460556375,"&gt;So why hasn't return-free filing happened yet? The short answer is lobbying, and in particular lobbying by companies like Intuit. In 2013, ProPublica's Liz Day wrote an incredible exposé on just how hard Intuit has lobbied to stop return-free filing from becoming a reality:

&gt;&gt;[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

&gt;&gt;Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

This is the problem.  [Campaign finance is the meta issue; it encompasses all others because every legislative battle today, comes down to money.](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/hillary-clintons-plan-to-reform-campaign-finance-i.html)"
"16175",1460553305,"&gt;The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it's been doing for years.

&gt;Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.

&gt;Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new ""return-free"" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like. Warren isn't the first person to propose this. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) both have similar bills this Congress.
"
"16176",1460554512,"This proposal makes far too much sense to ever make it through.

The US tax situation is messed up. I've now filed Dutch, French and US tax returns and the US one is by far the most effort.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

Have a web site so you can keep basic data up to date, such as address and dependents. Make filing an amendment in this case cost a little money to discourage procrastination in those who do have changes to make.

But the problem comes with state. With the same data, my tax software does federal and state automatically, and submits both. For anyone in a state with an income tax, having such a system wouldn't really make things any easier. "

"16411",1460732583,"Sanders' supporters won't likely listen to criticisms of him.  Unfortunately, this article is right on.  Now, if Sanders' purpose is to fuel his supporters, he more or less was successful at that.  He did what his supporters more or less expected him to do.  But to voters on the fence, his manner came off as being rude and probably condescending.  A lot of snarky remarks and finger pointing won't be perceived positively (let alone directed at a woman) by objective undecided voters.

To me, last night Sanders won when he challenged Clinton to release the transcripts.  She was clearly evasive.  But his sarcastic remarks were a turn off.  Clinton won in portraying herself was someone who could get things done.  Two particular points she made were convincing: one is about the minimum wage (she would sign a $15 minimum wave if the bill was on her desk, but to get there, you couldn't do it in one step) and fracking (her explanation how foreign countries have go to through fracking first before getting to green energy was convincing).

On Israel and Palestinian, I found Sanders' statements very eloquent (he can't explain his position better than that).  Unfortunately, the entire tone came off as not being supportive of Israel as Clinton.  It would win the Palestinian vote in NY.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.

Overall, Sanders' supporters will vote for him. Clinton's supporters will vote for her.  For those people on the edge, I think Clinton did a little better.  I thought Clinton's closing remarks were very effective.  She was very appealing to NYers who voted her to the Senate.  She was asking them and talking to them directly.  If these people vote for her again, Sanders will lose."

&gt;By this point in the debate cycle, Sanders should have been ready with specifics on how he'd pay for his proposals without raising the debt, hurting businesses or crushing the middle class

He literally brings up how he's going to pay for his proposals in *every single debate*. Clinton? Not so much. ""Closing loopholes"". Well, okay. This is exactly the answer that Romney gave to Obama during the 2012 debates on how his plans wouldn't effect the revenue in a negative way. 

&gt;He couldn't specify how he'd break up the banks, which he said he'd let them do themselves somehow.

When trusts were broken up by the courts under the Sherman Act, correct me if I'm wrong, the companies did the restructuring themselves. His answer was totally spot on, the Federal government says ""that's enough power for you"", not ""here is how we're going to internally change your company"".

&gt;CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process:
“Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturday’s 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.”

"16555",1460518395,"I wish candidates would stop citing ""contributions"" as a statistic. It's totally meaningless.

The impressive stats Sanders has, in real life, are:

- total # of contributors
- total # of contributors whose total donations per quarter are below $200
- average per-quarter donation
- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

This is also why Hillary pushes for $1 donations, it's specifically so she can cite that one garbage stat."

"16557",1460493080,"But at this point in 2008, Obama was winning and went on to win. Bernie right now is in a significant hole and is unlikely to get out of it.

So there are two possible conclusions: 

1) Bernie isn't that great of a campaigner, compared with Obama. He has more money on hand but can't translate that into votes. Maybe his campaign isn't run as well or isn't as astute as Obama's '08 campaign.

2) Money's influence in politics isn't absolute. Maybe money helps a campaign but can't fix all of a candidate's hurdles. 

It's probably a little of 1 and a little of 2."

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

&gt;Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

&gt;Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

&gt;Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

&gt;Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

&gt;Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.
