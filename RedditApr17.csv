One would think the oligarchy is determined that only a Democratic Wall Street or a Republican Wall Street candidate will win.  Either will work.

So, when does this ""democracy"" thing kick in?

And only the Democrats in a state are allowed to vote in the closed primaries, even though ""Independents"" is a larger group than either Democrats or Republicans.  In Open Primary Wisconsin, Sanders won Independents 72 to 28.  Sanders has lost ALL the primaries in states that bar independents from voting.  New York only allows registered Democrats to vote in the Democratic Primaries.  Who do you suppose will win that fixed race?

The only way a Closed Primary makes sense in the real world is if Independents are barred from voting in the general election for President.  And, because of the Closed Primaries, they effectually ARE barred from having the opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choice, as they won't have the opportunity to show their preference for Sanders.

Lets say a company has been very profitable for many years, and therefore has an extremely inflated stock price- it is worth more because of the profits it has made over the years.

Someone pays a hundred dollars in 2014 for a share.  Lets say that the going rate for investments is typically 3 or 4%- then he expects to ether get dividends of 3-4% per year or an increase in value of 3-4%, or some combination thereof.

Well, he bought it when it already had a history of these big profits, so his 100 dollars bought a very very small portion of the company, so he is getting a very very small portion of the profits.  If all of the sudden his dividends decrease, the value of his stocks will decrease drastically as well.

"256",1460473907,"There is nothing inherently wrong in occasionally testing students. The main issue is how the results are then used.

The results are currently being used to label students, teachers, and schools as ""failing"" or ""bad"". The data is being taken at-face, not taking into account things like student backgrounds. That means a teacher who brings a student from a 40% proficient level to a 60% proficient level is a failure while another teacher who keeps a 90% proficient student at a 90% proficient level is a success.

Because of the significant impact of these tests, everyone has taken them to a whole new level. People start to ""prepare"" for the tests. That automatically means that they no longer purely measure educational quality - they now measure the quality of the preparation for the tests. Schools spend a lot of time showing kids how to do better on the tests using various strategies. They focus primarily on material that will be on the tests, and ignore material that won't be there. Music and art? Can't test those, so that is time that can be better spent elsewhere. Critical thinking? Can't test that either, so that gets thrown by the wayside.

This has all gotten completely out of hand, and parents are sick of it. They are sick of the intense pressure that their kids face, and to be honest, more than a few are (including me) sick of the intense effort they have to expend on their kids' education. My parents never worked with me 5 days a week for 2 hours a day on homework and projects, and I am certain that the parents of immigrants in the 20s and 30s never worked with their children because they were illiterate in English.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-vermont-guns-responsible-for-new-york-violence/

&gt;Her statistics come from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which issued a report in 2013 saying **Vermont was in fact, adjusted for population, the highest per-capita source of guns recovered in other states.** That year, 23.5 guns per 100,000 residents, or a total of 147, were recovered in crimes committed outside of Vermont. The next-highest per capita state was New Hampshire, with 22.3 guns per 100,000 residents.

&gt;An ATF report from 2014 put Vermont in the top 15 states whose guns were recovered in New York. Still, it's worth noting that guns from Vermont are just a tiny fraction of the overall number of out-of-state guns recovered there: that year, Vermont's guns were 55 of the total 4,585 out-of-state guns. In the same year Georgia was the source for 386 out-of-state guns and 395 were traced to Virginia.

Here is her quote- ""Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest **per capita** number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""

So she was wrong about the New York part. But it is true that per- capita, Vermont is the number one source of guns recovered in other states. Which doesn't sound good, but obviously there aren't very many people in Vermont. ","Reddit"

I'll answer that for him because Sanders isn't going to answer it and his supporters are only going to weave you another fucking web of lies:

If Bernie Sanders loses NY by the numbers all the polls are showing (13-20%), then his campaign goes from improbable to impossible. Yes, impossible. The Bernie Sanders crew will tell you ""nothing is impossible if you dream hard enough!"" Or ""nuh uh! He has a 5% chance of winning! That's hope!"".
It's not. 

Unless this is your first rodeo, you know how primaries and elections work. You know that nobody recovers from a loss that huge. You know that with a lead that fat, the supers will stay with Hillary. You know and are aware that Sanders has MAJOR weaknesses when it comes to campaigning and he probably won't be able to recover from the 300 delegate deficit after NY. You know that Hillary is going to absolutely win Indiana, Maryland, DC, Pennsylvania... Those states alone will deliver all the delegates Hillary needs to win. If she wins Maryland 60-40, it's wraps. If she wins PA by 55, it's wraps. If she wins Indiana by 50%, it's wraps. 

Another way to put it:He just isn't going to win in a meaningful way. If Bernie loses New York by the margins predicted (or by more), it will have erased almost all the gains he made all of March and early April. If she goes on to take PA like she's forecasted to, then she finishes erasing the Sanders wins and then pads her own lead... Again. Losing NY will mean Sanders has to win by a margin of 60% from here on out.


And he Berned through his favorable states with very little to show for it. They'll downvote me to shut me up, you can be guaranteed of that. But Jesus Christ, people in this sub ought to and need to hear the truth. This place is such a tight echo chamber people actually believe this race is close/neck and neck.

&gt;Bernies Sanders supporter and business/Corporate attorney here...

&gt;This is pretty common. Businesses incorporate in Delaware more than any other state, and a lot of those businesses don't actually have a physical business in Delaware. They need an address for service of process reasons, and so there are companies set up that just act as agents for that reason at one address. Every state has at least a few companies that are service of process agencies that will have thousands and thousands of companies listed under their address. Incredibly normal and honestly, not in the least bit shady. I help set up entities every day that are completely above-board that we use these types of agencies for. As an attorney, I am obligated to do what is legally permissible that is in my clients best interest. It's no different here.

&gt;*Edit: I should also note that setting up a business entity, which is more than likely pass-through and it is taxed as ordinary income, for consulting, receiving fees, etc. is not unusual in the least. I would have recommended that to every single one of my clients in their position, and I'm honestly surprised it took Bill until 2008 to set his LLC up.

&gt;**Edit part deux: There have been a lot of statements with the general tone of ""It's not about whether it's legal, it's about whether it is ethical,"" in regards to organizing entities in Delaware vs. their home state. My response to that would be two-fold:

&gt;First, the smallest and the largest of companies organize in Delaware not really for tax benefits, but because of the Court of Chancery and the extensive case-law Delaware provides (if she was setting up the limited liability company as a tax-haven, she would have organized it in Nevada--not Delaware). Over half of the companies organized in America are organized in Delaware, so they have judicial rulings on almost every aspect, whereas many states will have issues that have never even been brought before their Courts. It's all about certainty and speed. The Court of Chancery is incredibly quick (as is the Delaware Sec. of State's office) in resolving issues. Something that would probably take a year to litigate in California might be a few weeks in Delaware. In addition, they are constantly updating their statutes to correct and ambiguities or conflicting provisions--things other states just don't do. There are some banks that will only lend to companies organized in Delaware because of the certainty of their laws and court rulings. If you want businesses to organize in your home jurisdictions, then I beg you to encourage your state legislature to pour more money into our back-logged court system.

&gt;Second, and I can't stress this point enough, I guarantee you the most likely reason that their entities were incorporated in Delaware was probably because that's what their attorneys and accountants told them to do. There are some tax benefits for her to set up an LLC to receive revenue from her book deal in Delaware, as intangible assets aren't taxed (which is why a lot of bands, artists, consultants, authors, etc. will set up LLCs in Delaware), but the savings are likely not that huge. The biggest reason is probably because that is the jurisdiction her attorney's and accountants are familiar with and it makes their life a shit-ton easier. The type of LLC she set it is probably considered a ""disregarded entity"" anyways and is essentially treated as a sole proprietorship.

&gt;***Edit Part Trois: This is more a personal thing--I am a Bernie Sander's donor, volunteer, and even a state delegate for him. However, as several individuals have pointed out, a lot of my comments are essentially ""If you love Bernie Sanders for his policies, do whatever you can to help him win the nomination, but IF he doesn't--please for the sake of all that Bernie cares for, vote for Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination."" That's because I'm a pragmatist with idealist tendencies. And for me, the only issue is the Supreme Court. Go through my past comments and you will find a giant list of cases that were decided 5-4 which were harmful to the poor, to minorities, and to the average American and beneficial for the rich and corporations. The Supreme Court is basically all I've talked about since even before Scalia died. Bernie Sander's policies, progressive legislation of the past and future, and essentially everything liberals have fought for since the 1930s is under threat or has already been destroyed by a conservative Supreme Court. Don't give it another 30 years to keep undermining our Democracy.

&gt;Go read Sander's book ""An Outsider in the House"" beginning on page 24. Replace ""Bill"" with ""Hillary"" and ""Dick Armey"" with ""Paul Ryan"" and you have Bernie Sanders explaining exactly why I would support a Hillary Presidency if she gets the nomination vs Trump, Cruz (who is the most dangerous of any candidate in decades), John Kasich, or even Paul Ryan. This election is too important for a protest vote for me. So call me a shill for Hillary--I'll keep donating and working for Sanders regardless--but for the love of God, stop posting baseless smear shit like this or you are the same as Rush Limbaugh.

Yes, we all know how great Delaware is for business, yes we *know it's legal to operate like this*, but like many things this isn't a pull that the American people should have to continue to swallow.

Dear REPRESENTATIVE XXXX,

I am writing you today in support of Representative Rick Nolan's motion to declassify 28 pages of the 9-11 Commission's official report in the hope that you will do the same. As the most serious attack against the United States since Pearl Harbor, the terrorism of September 11th obviously holds an eminent place in our minds. Doubly so given that we have embroiled ourselves in what is now our third war related to the events of that tragic day. 

Consequently, it is essential that the American people have full knowledge of the circumstances and history of September 11th. It is only when we are fully informed that we will be able to make the important decisions required of a democratic electorate. There is no place for the sort of paternalism which would withhold critical information out of the fear that the voters are not equipped to reliably interpret it. To admit as much is a rejection of democratic principles.

If those 28 pages about the financing of the September 11th terrorists should reveal some shocking fact about our allies in Saudi Arabia so be it. Perhaps they should not be our allies after all.

Sincerely,

YYYY","Reddit"

"797",1460441238,"Since this is almost surely destined for the front-page, here are Clinton's [unabridged statements](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-hillary-clinton-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2596292) to the NYDN on Honduras (which is the basis for OP's article) for anyone who wants to read more:

&gt; **Daily News:** Secretary Clinton, I'd like to ask you if I can about Latin-America and the policies specifically you were directly involved in, the coup in Honduras. As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn't do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias adeal for new elections.

&gt; But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There's been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?

&gt; **Clinton:** Well, let me again try to put this in context. The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent the military to take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people, and that triggers a legal necessity. There's no way to get around it. So our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow walk and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of without calling it a coup.

&gt; So you're right. I worked very hard with leaders in the region and got Oscar Arias, the Nobel Prize winner, to take the lead on trying to broker a resolution. Without bloodshed. And that was very important to us that… Zelaya had friends and allies not just in Honduras but in some of the neighboring countries like Nicaragua, and that we could have had a terrible civil war that would have been just terrifying in its loss of life.

&gt; So I think we came out with a solution that did hold new elections, but it did not in any way address the structural, systemic problems in that society. And I share your concern that it's not just government actions. Drug gangs, traffickers of all kinds are preying on the people of Honduras.

&gt; So I think we need to do more of a Colombian plan for Central America, because remember what was going in Colombia when first my husband and then followed by President Bush had Plan Colombia, which was to try to use our leverage to rein in the government in their actions against the FARC and the guerillas, but also to help the government stop the advance of the FARC and guerillas.

&gt; And now we're in the middle of peace talks. It didn't happen overnight. It took a number of years, but I want to see a much more comprehensive approach towards Central America because it's just Honduras. The highest murder rate is in El Salvador and we've got Guatemala with all the problems you know so well.

&gt; So I think in retrospect we managed a very difficult situation without bloodshed, without a civil war that led to a new election, and I think that was better for the Honduran people, but we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with violence and the gangs and so much else.

Incidentally, she's wrong about the law as the wikileaks emails prove that even the DOS in Honduras believed this to be an illegal coup and called it as much in their own private channels. Outside of the US, there was unanimous agreement amongst our peers that the Honduran military had acted illegally. More importantly though, HRC has no remorse over any of the people that she has hurt over the course of her career, specifically as secretary of state. She has no problem lying to you and saying that her reasons for not using the word coup were humanitarian - as opposed to serving the financial interests of the oligarchs who constructed the coup and subsequently lobbied the State Department for preferential treatment.

How many of you know that the so called Nordic socialist countries have a much lower corporate tax rate than the US?  Or that Singapore, South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Japan all carve out tax shelters for their national champions?

China is destined to become the world's biggest economy in 25 years, if not sooner.  I don't mean by purchasing power parity measures ... I mean in absolute terms.  China will be the biggest market, and the US might even fall to third behind India.

Domination of foreign markets is in the interest of the US both from an economical point of view, and also a military point of view.  Having national companies that are dominant players in the most dynamic and competitive markets ensures that the nation's technology will remain ahead of competitors.

The US tax code is a terrible mix of loopholes and high rates.  If companies actually paid the US's ridiculous tax rates, they could not exist in competition with foreign companies.  They need the loopholes just to compete.

When margins are slim, even a small tax increase can mean the difference between profitable and unsustainable business.

The issue is that Sanders and his supporters don't understand that business is international and that markets are everywhere.  For sure you could force US companies to stay at home by making their foreign tax rates so high that they can't compete with anyone.  Then you would have to raise high tariff walls to keep foreign companies out of the US market, so US companies could survive at least in the domestic market.

But then you will have committed to tariffs and a protected market.

In the long run, the world outside the protected market will move on and leave the US far behind.  Markets outside the US won't be so protected and soft as the US market.  They'll be bloody and vicious.  In those markets companies will become lean and will evolve quickly.  Their technology and products will be better, because they will have to get better just to survive.

It'll be like when the Japanese Shogun shut off Japan from the outside world because he didn't like muskets and wanted to protect the sword-wielding Samurai.  Well, the outside world didn't stand still.  The outside world had bloody competition, and when the US came back a century later with warships and canons, the Japanese were far behind.

50 years of Sanders-type of tariffs, and high taxation, and our grand children will have a bunch of musket companies trying to face off against machine gun companies outside the US.

You want an example of this, see the history of India's auto company called Hindustan Motor Company (which made the Ambassador car).  Compare the Ambassador car in the year 2012 to any other car in that year.  That tells you the effectiveness of protecting national champions, instead of forcing them to compete abroad (with the best products and tax rates).","Reddit"

"923",1460391754,"Bernies Sanders supporter and business/Corporate attorney here...

This is pretty common. Businesses incorporate in Delaware more than any other state, and a lot of those businesses don't actually have a physical business in Delaware. They need an address for service of process reasons, and so there are companies set up that just act as agents for that reason at one address. Every state has at least a few companies that are service of process agencies that will have thousands and thousands of companies listed under their address. Incredibly normal and honestly, not in the least bit shady. I help set up entities every day that are completely above-board that we use these types of agencies for. As an attorney, I am obligated to do what is legally permissible that is in my clients best interest. It's no different here.

*Edit: I should also note that setting up a business entity, which is more than likely pass-through and it is taxed as ordinary income, for consulting, receiving fees, etc. is not unusual in the least. I would have recommended that to every single one of my clients in their position, and I'm honestly surprised it took Bill until 2008 to set his LLC up.

**Edit part deux: There have been a lot of statements with the general tone of ""It's not about whether it's legal, it's about whether it is ethical,"" in regards to organizing entities in Delaware vs. their home state. My response to that would be two-fold: 

First, the smallest and the largest of companies organize in Delaware not really for tax benefits, but because of the Court of Chancery and the extensive case-law Delaware provides (if she was setting up the limited liability company as a tax-haven, she would have organized it in Nevada--not Delaware). Over half of the companies organized in America are organized in Delaware, so they have judicial rulings on almost every aspect, whereas many states will have issues that have never even been brought before their Courts. It's all about certainty and speed. The Court of Chancery is incredibly quick (as is the Delaware Sec. of State's office) in resolving issues. Something that would probably take a year to litigate in California might be a few weeks in Delaware. In addition, they are constantly updating their statutes to correct and ambiguities or conflicting provisions--things other states just don't do. There are some banks that will only lend to companies organized in Delaware because of the certainty of their laws and court rulings. If you want businesses to organize in your home jurisdictions, then I beg you to encourage your state legislature to pour more money into our back-logged court system.

Second, and I can't stress this point enough, I guarantee you the most likely reason that their entities were incorporated in Delaware was probably because that's what their attorneys and accountants told them to do. There are some tax benefits for her to set up an LLC to receive revenue from her book deal in Delaware, as intangible assets aren't taxed (which is why a lot of bands, artists, consultants, authors, etc. will set up LLCs in Delaware), but the savings are likely not that huge. The biggest reason is probably because that is the jurisdiction her attorney's and accountants are familiar with and it makes their life a shit-ton easier. The type of LLC she set it is probably considered a ""disregarded entity"" anyways and is essentially treated as a sole proprietorship.

***Edit Part Trois: This is more a personal thing--I am a Bernie Sander's donor, volunteer, and even a state delegate for him. However, as several individuals have pointed out, a lot of my comments are essentially ""If you love Bernie Sanders for his policies, do whatever you can to help him win the nomination, but IF he doesn't--please for the sake of all that Bernie cares for, vote for Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination."" That's because I'm a pragmatist with idealist tendencies. And for me, the only issue is the Supreme Court. Go through my past comments and you will find a giant list of cases that were decided 5-4 which were harmful to the poor, to minorities, and to the average American and beneficial for the rich and corporations. The Supreme Court is basically all I've talked about since even before Scalia died. Bernie Sander's policies, progressive legislation of the past and future, and essentially everything liberals have fought for since the 1930s is under threat or has already been destroyed by a conservative Supreme Court. Don't give it another 30 years to keep undermining our Democracy.

Go read Sander's book ""An Outsider in the House"" beginning on page 24. Replace ""Bill"" with ""Hillary"" and ""Dick Armey"" with ""Paul Ryan"" and you have Bernie Sanders explaining exactly why I would support a Hillary Presidency if she gets the nomination vs Trump, Cruz (who is the most dangerous of any candidate in decades), John Kasich, or even Paul Ryan. This election is too important for a protest vote for me. So call me a shill for Hillary--I'll keep donating and working for Sanders regardless--but for the love of God, stop posting baseless smear shit like this or you are the same as Rush Limbaugh.","Reddit"

&gt;The author, “America’s Rabbi,” is the international bestselling author of 30 books including his upcoming The Israel Warrior’s Handbook. Follow him on Twitter @ RabbiShmuley.

Not exactly who I'm going to for analysis frankly.

&gt;In the entire forced dump of Clinton’s emails, you will be hard pressed to find a single one sympathetic toward the Jewish state from any of the people she relied on. 

Not really.  I've only read a fraction of them, and I've seen many about what the US needs to do to help Israel.

edit: Notice how the article provides no actual quotes?  They could very easily provide the entire emails themselves to put them in context, but instead just make vague references.

&gt;Sandy Berger was Clinton’s foreign policy adviser during her 2008 presidential campaign. In September of 2010 he sent her ideas on how to pressure Israel to make concessions for peace. Berger acknowledged “how fragile is Abbas’s political position,” and how “Palestinians are in disarray,” and that “failure is a real possibility.” Berger was well aware of, and informed Hillary of, the very real possibility that Israel would be placing its national security at grave risk in a deal that would very likely fail and lead to a Hamas takeover.

&gt;**But Berger felt the risks to Israeli lives were worth it.**

&gt;He advised the need to make Netanyahu feel “uneasy about incurring our displeasure....”

&gt;Berger emphasizes the need “to convince the prime minister – through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure – to make the necessary compromises” and talks of the “possibility – to turn his position against him.”


Sounds like Berger was just talking about standard negotiating?  I notice the point about ""Berger felt the risks to Israel lives were worth it"" isn't an actual quote, unlike the rest. 

edit: [I found the email in question - I don't think the author got the date correct](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_August_Web/IPS-0093/DOC_0C05771036/C05771036.pdf)

&gt;Anne Marie Slaughter was Clinton’s director of policy planning from 2009-2011. She wrote to Clinton in September of 2010 and devised a scheme to encourage wealthy philanthropists to pledge millions to the Palestinians (which no doubt would have been embezzled by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his cronies as were other funds).

&gt;She wrote: “This may be a crazy idea.... Suppose we launched a “Pledge for Palestine” campaign... Such a campaign among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world would reflect a strong vote of confidence in the building of a Palestinian state....”

&gt;She adds: “There would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis who, would be building settlements in the face of a pledge for peace.”

&gt;Clinton’s response to this email: “I am very interested- pls flesh out. Thx.”

[How is this anti-Israel?](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_NovWeb/08627IA2/DOC_0C05775206/C05775206.pdf)

&gt;Robert Russo, one of Clinton’s aides and currently her campaign’s “director of correspondence and briefings” sent an email in April of 2012 informing her of Netanyahu’s father’s death and advising her to give him a condolence call. Included with Russo’s email is an extremely biased article attacking both Netanyahu and his father, describing them as virulently racist warmongers and calling the elder Netanyahu “a behindthe- scenes adviser to his son, the most powerful person in Israel.”

&gt;The article noted that “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly denied that his father was a one-dimensional ideologue. He further emphasized that he himself was a different person from his father.”

&gt;But then it goes on to say, without providing any proof whatsoever, “Israelis seemed in the dark about the extent of paternal influence on their leader,” and “To understand Bibi, you have to understand the father.”

&gt;**One might be forgiven for questioning Clinton’s sympathy and sincerity when she later placed the call and gave Netanyahu her condolences.**

Can we be forgiven for assuming the author is incredibly biased or blatantly misleading?  [The author is bitching about a NYT story (note: wikileaks link)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/4845)

&gt;Thomas Pickering, former US ambassador to Israel, wrote to Clinton on December 18, 2011, and suggested a secret plan to stir up major Palestinian protests in an attempt to force the Israeli government into peace negotiations.

[Decide for yourself.](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_OctWeb/231/DOC_0C05790860/C05790860.pdf)

&gt;This idiotic reasoning that somehow only women would participate and things would stay peaceful is obviously absurd. As Pickering himself notes, “Palestinian men will not for long patiently demonstrate – they will be inclined over time and much too soon to be frustrated and use force. Their male culture comes close to requiring it.”

Pickering *didn't* say that only women would participate - he stressed that it was important that only women should - else it would turn violent.","Reddit"

Interesting. Changing their collateral requirements will strongly motivate them to come up with a plan they feel will meet the needs of the regulatiors. Because they're not going to want to hold more stuff if they can get away with it.

"1513",1460565878,"Ina prior position I did a lot of research in to ""Recovery and Resolution Plans"", which we'll usually hear called ""living wills"" for banks. Basically certain large banks are required to put together a plan that describes how they'll maintain liquidity if there are problems (either with them or the economy as a whole), and if they can't, how they'll unwind (go bankrupt) gracefully so they don't bring down anyone worse with them.

The banks have had years to work on this, and I don't know of a single one that's taking it seriously. The plans I'd seen read like boiler plate legalese with a few financial details thrown in. You can read the whole thing and wonder ""that was a plan??""

And regulators have agreed. It's such a simple and common sense regulation, and if they took it seriously the banks could argue that they're not too big to fail.

The new banks are sold on public exchanges with proceeds going to the FDIC, shares issued to employees, and lastly to the former owners/creditors of the banks.

"1651",1460557521,"&gt; There are problems with the broader story Sanders tells. His ongoing insistence that Obama-era reforms were woefully insufficient — and his explanation for it, i.e., that Dems remain in thrall to plutocratic money and failed to rally the grassroots to break GOP opposition — are overly simplistic, give those achievements short shrift, **and don’t fully reckon with our system’s structural realities.**

This is the problem with WaPo and other MSM outlets today. It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd. It's the constant defeatism and uninspiring approval of the truly meager progress being made that shifts focus away from the biggest problems in today's political landscape, which *are* structural and pervasive, not specific and discrete. How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

The rise of both Sanders *and* Trump is showing us that people are *not* happy with status quo politics or politicians. That the majority of people want *drastic* change, not faux pragmatism that is really leading us nowhere fast.

It's just downright offensive. And anytime Sanders does get media coverage it must ALWAYS be positive, anything that isn't a glowing praise for Sanders is just a blatant corporate hatchet job.

Maybe if millennials actually managed to pay attention to politics for more then one election cycle things might actually change. But instead all the Bernie bros want to vote for Trump if Sanders doesn't win the nomination? What kind of nonsense is that? You believe that the minimum wage must be raised so much that if the guy you want doesn't win you want to vote for the guy who wants to abolish the minimum wage? For fucks sake... Trump isn't anti-establishment, he's pro-Trump. He's has 0 interest in changing anything, he just wants to win.

"1753",1460508110,"The super delegates aren't ""rigging"" the system.  They have never in their history of existence swung a nom away from the pledged delegate leader.

The reason why his 7 state win streak hasn't accounted to a huge change in the race is most of those states are smaller states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Wyoming) And the system is rarely a winner take all, and winning by a huge margin in a state worth 20 to 30 delegates isn't worth as much by winning a state worth 300 by the same margin or even a much closer one.  For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

"1756",1460510197,"I have been stalking this election as an outside observer to the US and it really is fascinating to me. I am utterly bemused by the lack of critical analysis of a range of sources and the ability for everyday Americans to draw their own informed and fully justified conclusion.


I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

"1838",1460564042,"One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!","Reddit"

The problem is Bernie doesn't want to fully hang the albatross around Hillary's neck, perhaps in deference to the fact that she is likely to be the nominee and will need progressives' support in the general. 

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

Everyone in the establishment is warning that Bernie had better be careful and not do anything to permanently damage Hillary. But you KNOW if Bernie were leading Hillary would do everything she could to permanently damage Bernie without hesitation, because all she cares about is winning, despite her claims to the contrary. And nobody in the establishment would come to Bernie's defense and say ""hey back off don't destroy our potential nominee."" And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

"2177",1460646328,"&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679).

I did an analysis of what the delegates totals would be if the South voted today, and if Bernie lost the black vote by 40 points (30-70) Clinton's lead would be about ~115 less, or around 100.  This is assuming he still does a little worse than he has in statess like Missouri, but I think the 30% is a reasonable mark.

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm.

Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.

Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.

I wish the author of this story was read the fable ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" as a young child.  He would then understand the dangers of yelling about a serious issue when there is no serious issue in sight.

A couple qualifiers before I continue, since it's now fun to call people racist. I have had a black homeless man stay overnight with me in my house. I worked in a predominantly black inner city school.  When a black kid stole my phone from me, and the police brought him to me and encouraged me to press charges against him, I told the kid I wouldn't because I don't believe that the criminal justice system is effective in changing behaviors from negative to positive.  When he missed his bus after school because of being handcuffed and brought to me, I gave him a ride home.  My father-in-law is black.  The list goes on and on, but it's ultimately a shame I have to list off these type of things to MAYBE get the pass from well to do east village (usually white, not sure about this case) bloggers that I'm not racist.

This article is not talking about a race problem.  Here's proof:

1.) Take yourself, and your expired, white boy ID to a college campus bar, and try to get in with an expired ID.  40% of the time, an expired ID won't get you into a bar.  A larger percentage of times, you won't be able to buy liquor at a liquor store. Why? Because people look alike.  Expired IDs can be given to those people.  It is not a valid ID, no matter the color of your skin.  I have been denied entry into places for this reason.  If I get pulled over with an expired ID, I get a ticket.  

2.) The BMV is a pain in the ass, plain and simple.  I had to switch from an Indiana to Ohio drivers license.  Went in with a valid passport, a valid drivers license, a marriage certificate, a print out of my tax return (I e-file, so there is no ""official"" copy).  The result?  Denied, because nothing was an official document with my social security number on it.  Photocopies aren't acceptable.  I fought and reasoned, saying that a passport is more or less the gold standard for identification...but the rules are the rules, and there is no exception. The woman promised me, that even if her sister came in with the same documents as me, she couldn't give her a license, lest she lose her job.  

3.) When the day is done, the name on the most official document this man had does not match his name.  If the white wife of newly wed couple moved to Wisconsin, and had not had time to fully complete her name change process, she would have the same issues.

Look, I tend to think that voter ID laws are designed to prevent the poorest of poor from voting.  I also know that if you are among the poorest of poor, your chances of being black are much greater than your chances of being white.  I can connect the dots.  But this article headline makes it sound like the KKK was standing behind the counter of the BMV and denied him because he was black.  Articles like these are exactly why an asshole fascist like Trump has gained traction...and why his supporters don't think racism exists.  Fox News and Glen Beck will rip this article apart, and say ""see!  Because this article was wrongly saying the issue was because of race, accusations racism are universally farcical.""

(The Washington Post gave it three Pinocchios.) Sanders is hitting fracking hard upstate, calling for a federal ban, and tying it along with the Wall Street money Clinton has received to the theme, “You can’t make the right political decisions unless you are free of the influence of special interests,” Devine said.

I feel like the whole concept of a career is completely changing and my generation won't ever see the kind of working environment that generations before us have. Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily. And it makes more sense to me that the 'benefits' be paid for with our taxes rather than out of pocket. Obviously the cost of it is daunting, but I think it will only makes sense moving forward.

"2552",1460647105,"As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result.","Reddit"

"2562",1460615853,"Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else.","Reddit"

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp; (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else.","Reddit"

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

All planned to vote for Sanders. It shouldn't matter much as Hillary won by a blowout in this state, but it still happened. 

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana. If I called breathlessly to a local election official with how several people I know plus dozens upon dozens of people on Internet were disenfranchised, it would all be shrugged off.

"2829",1460653839,"Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman have written an [article](http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/36110-focus-is-the-2016-election-already-being-stripped-a-flipped) on the subject entitled, ""Is the 2016 Election Already Being Stripped &amp; Flipped?"", which is worth the read.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues.","Reddit"

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job.

1. What about people whose employers send out W-2s (or other documents) late or with incorrect information? Employers won't like the potential for liability on their part.

"4105",1460607809,"Okay. It is good as the whole build-up to it is ""Save the children!"". But here's why it is not good in the long run. It costs $10,000 just to apply to be a grower. Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

"4434",1460641299,"Outsourced i can understand, and get behind. Automated however, will be difficult to stop and hard to justify against. 

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.  

This is all theoretical of course, but its one scenario keep imaging with this situation.","Reddit"

"4978",1460572352,"&gt; At least two-thirds of all active U.S. corporations paid nothing in federal income taxes during the 2006-12 period, despite an income-dependent statutory tax rate of 15 percent to 35 percent, the Government Accountability Office said in a recent report. 

&gt; Among large, profitable entities, 19.5 percent paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2012, said the report, which came at the behest of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, whose campaign circulated the study.

Maybe this is why Verizon had a negative 2.8% effective income tax rate for 2008-2012, while simultaneously claiming they can't afford to provide their employees with reasonable benefits.

They did manage to come up with $225,000 to [pay Hillary for a speech](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2015/08/Hillary%20Clinton%20Speeches%202013-2015_1.jpg) in 2013 though. I wonder if they expensed that?","Reddit"

The year is 2016, if you have to pretend to be upset because of the use of the word 'whore' you have much bigger problems than the same 'institutionalised sexism' Sanders is an opponent of anyway.

His successes pale when compared to Mrs Clinton's massive earlier wins in populous southern states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, which alone netted her 184 delegates over Mr Sanders.

That does not seem unfair.  Why should Wyoming outweigh Florida?

This is the only evidence they give that the Democratic primaries are rigged.

The main evidence I have seen boils down to this:  ""Bernie is the candidate of the people.  If it were not rigged, he would be winning.""  The idea that most people really prefer Clinton seems to not occur to Sanders supporters.  And they think that people who prefer Clinton are stupid, low information voters who just have not heard the Truth about Sanders.  I feel like I am talking to Jehovah Witnesses sometimes.","Reddit"

Next, I am going through the fraud reports I go to the IRS and found out someone had claimed my tax return for several years and on top of that, after reviewing the returns, the IRS said they were all unaudited, just approved, and completely fraudulent as they were also claiming like 10k in tax credits and getting massive returns, and that took months to resolve...

The whole thing was a nightmare and when they finally tracked the guy down, they say he had already gone back to Mexico. Oh and, what that really means is he probably got spooked with the credit freeze and all monitoring so he went back to the black market and bought another identity.

No one really knows how my identity got stolen, but I personally suspect it was a clerk at my pediatric office as I tagged my kids now to the same doctor I had when I was a kid, and I asked what happened to her and the nurse told me that she was arrested by the police for using stolen identities and had racked up like a quarter million in theft done years back. 

I can't prove it, but how much you wanna bet this Hispanic lady had a side business selling fresh clean social security numbers from the files at the doctor's office? This was a large practice, 6 pediatrician partners. Thousands of patients...

That year was seriously a living hell for me. I remember how embarrassed I was when I got turned down from a job after being interviewed and hired and then my background check came back and they said my credit was worrisome so they didn't hire me, saying they would be happy to talk to me again when I resolved it all.

"5686",1460556375,"&gt;So why hasn't return-free filing happened yet? The short answer is lobbying, and in particular lobbying by companies like Intuit. In 2013, ProPublica's Liz Day wrote an incredible exposé on just how hard Intuit has lobbied to stop return-free filing from becoming a reality:

&gt;&gt;[In 2007] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies: Reps. Eric Cantor, R-Va., the conservative House majority leader, and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley.

&gt;&gt;Intuit's political committee and employees have contributed to both. Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $26,100 in the past five years from the company's PAC and employees. In the last two years, the Intuit PAC and employees donated $26,000 to Lofgren.

This is the problem.  [Campaign finance is the meta issue; it encompasses all others because every legislative battle today, comes down to money.](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/hillary-clintons-plan-to-reform-campaign-finance-i.html)","Reddit"
"5687",1460553305,"&gt;The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it's been doing for years.

&gt;Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.

&gt;Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new ""return-free"" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like. Warren isn't the first person to propose this. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) both have similar bills this Congress.

The French have a website you can log in to where you're basically run through a step-by-step process where you first select which items apply to you (sources of incomes, deductions, tax credits) and then it'll show you precisely those forms you need to fill in. You fill in everything online and submit.

The Dutch tax service has a similar system, but in the form of software program (that has been supported for Windows, Mac and Linux for many years now). On top of that, you can use your personal government account to pre-fill the tool with all the data the tax department has about you (marital status, income, etc...). When I was filing Dutch taxes, my situation was fairly straightforward and no manual corrections were needed, so it basically involved logging in to fetch the data, click next a few times and it was done.

In both countries, regular paper forms are available for people who prefer that over technology or who are in a rare situation that isn't covered by the logic of the software.

&gt;CDP Chair Statement on Nominating Process
Denver, Colorado - Today, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio released the following statement related to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process:
“Today, the Denver Post misreported several facts which relate to Colorado’s Democratic nominating process. On caucus night, preliminary and unofficial results were posted online in an effort to share as much information as we had in a timely manner. Those preliminary and unofficial results showed a higher level of support for Secretary Clinton than she actually received in a handful of precincts in Denver County. After a verification process, the official results, along with the caucus worksheets were sent to both Presidential campaigns at the same time just days following precinct caucuses. It appeared that the Clinton campaign did not review the information until last week, at which point they asked to clarify the information previously sent to their team.
""What was posted on caucus night were only preliminary results which were not used in the allocation of delegates at any level. The Denver Post misreported this fact, and didn't accurately report the fact that both campaigns received the correct data at the same time within days of the caucus. If one used the official data which was shared with both presidential campaigns to predict the outcome of the 1st Congressional District Convention, the prediction would have been 5 delegates for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates for Sec. Clinton, and the actual, official results of the Saturday’s 1st Congressional District Convention were 5 delegates elected for Sen. Sanders and 3 delegates elected for Sec. Clinton.
""We sincerely apologize for this confusion it has caused around the caucus process and any changes that affect the estimation of national delegates allocated in the state of Colorado.”

The impressive stats Sanders has, in real life, are:

- total # of contributors
- total # of contributors whose total donations per quarter are below $200
- average per-quarter donation
- % of total campaign cash that came from donors whose quarterly donation total is below $200

The $27 average donation figure frankly is a garbage stat devoid of any meaning.

The most important stat is the last one, what % of your money comes from small-dollar donors (under $200 TOTAL per quarter). That's the statistic that gleans some insight on whether a candidate is ""bought"" or not.

Bernie also is terrible at putting Hillary's fundraising into the ugly context it belongs. Hillary ALWAYS cites the % of her donors who are small-dollar-donors, to make it sound like she's grassroots-funded. For reasons I can't fathom, Bernie never rebuts her by citing the fact that Hillary's small dollar donors only account for like 50% of her campaign cash (I made that % up, don't know the real stat offhand), and like 25% (again, made up stat) if you factor in Hillary's Super PACs (which you should).

"6036",1460558032,"Goldman admitted to fraud, which largely contributed to the destruction of our economy.

Goldman Sachs has total assets of approximately $911 Billion dollars. They were fined just 5 billion dollars.

Imagine if you as a private citizen were convicted of mortgage fraud:

&gt;Mortgage fraud is a serious crime, and one punished by significant penalties. Because mortgage fraud can involve different crimes at either the state and federal level, the potential penalties associated with the crime differ widely. Mortgage fraud is typically charged as a felony offense, but misdemeanor crimes are possible in cases where only a small amount of money is involved, typically less than about $1,000.

&gt;Prison. Prison penalties for mortgage fraud can be significant. A conviction for federal mortgage fraud charges can result in a federal prison sentence of 30 years, while state convictions can last a few years or more. Misdemeanor fraud convictions can bring jail sentences of up to a year.

&gt;Fines. Fines for mortgage fraud are often extremely high, especially when professional fraud is involved. A conviction for a single count of a federal mortgage fraud can result in a fine of up to $1 million. State fines can range from a few thousand dollars for a misdemeanor convictions to $100,000 or more for felony convictions.

&gt;Restitution. Mortgage fraud convictions often include restitution payments as well. Restitution is different than a fine, though they both involve money. Restitution is designed to compensate the injured party for your wrongdoing, while the government imposes a fine as a penalty. If, for example, you are convicted of mortgage fraud after you make false statements when applying for a mortgage, you may have to pay restitution to the lender in addition to your fines.

&gt;Probation. Probation sentences can be imposed for a mortgage fraud conviction separately from, or in addition to, fines and prison sentences. Probation sentences for mortgage fraud typically last at least one year, but longer terms are common. Someone on probation must meet specified court requirements, such as making regular reports to a probation officer, submitting to random drug testing, and refraining from committing other criminal acts.

Based on a percentage of GS' total assets to the $5bn fine imposed, this would be like if instead of all the bad stuff quoted above,  and you had $60,000 in total assets, you would be fined roughly $325.

If GS was fined an amount commensurate to what just the minimum STATE felony fine that a private citizen would pay, it would bankrupt them. This isn't even including the federal fine of a million dollars.

&gt;Bertha Oliva compared the current situation to the early 1980s, when the CIA funded, armed, and trained Honduran government death squads that murdered hundreds of opposition activists.

and:
&gt;“When we first began in 1982, we faced death squads,” said Oliva, also speaking through a translator. “Now, it’s like going back to the past. We know there are death squads in Honduras.”

also:
&gt;The coup was accompanied by a huge rise in political violence. By 2012, state security forces had assassinated more than 300 people, and 34 members of the opposition and 13 journalists had disappeared, according to data compiled by Honduran human rights organizations. The political assassinations added to the emboldened violence from gangs and drug traffickers, making Honduras one of the most dangerous countries in the world. In 2012, Reuters reported that it had the highest murder rate of any country.

&gt;Although the murder rate has since declined, political violence in Honduras has continued. Since the end of 2012, at least 22 prominent environmental activists have been killed, according to Global Witness.

But he clearly drew from his experiences in the 1980s and '90s an acute sensitivity to the world-shaking stakes of great power rivalries, and a firm belief in the role that deterrence and nuclear weapons still play.

&gt;Carter described a world where not just American power but also global peace and stability will be increasingly challenged by other powers. He returned over and over to the same answer to this problem: the power of deterrence, backed up by overwhelming American superiority and, ultimately, by nuclear weapons.

&gt;But deterrence works on decades-old understandings of warfare that are, today, rapidly changing. As countries develop new tools and techniques of war, Carter warned that deterrence, the foundation on which American power and global stability are built, needs to change as well.

&gt;That is not a challenge that grabs as many headlines as terrorism or rogue states. But the stakes — the international order as know it, 70 years of peace between the major powers, and the thousands of nuclear warheads backing it up — could not be higher.

We're also now the national leader in the rebellion against higher educational standards and teacher accountability. I don't know how much you've been following this. But on Long Island, more than half of students refused to take standardized tests last week. So, do you support tough national standards like Common Core, and judging teachers partially based on the test results of their students? And these are two very specific things.

&gt;Clinton: Well, I have always supported national standards. I've always believed that we need to have some basis on which to determine whether we're making progress, vis-à-vis other countries who all have national standards. And I've also been involved in the past, not recently, in promoting such an approach and I know Common Core started out as a, actually non-partisan, not bi-partisan, a non-partisan effort that was endorsed very much across the political spectrum. Well, you have to ask yourself, what happened? I mean here was this process that seemed to be really on the way of making clear that yes, we have local control, but you parent, you teacher, you elected official in your local district, at your state level, you need to be sure that you are benchmarking to those standards. That's why we need to have them. What went wrong? I think the roll-out was disastrous. I think the way they rolled out the Common Core and the expectation you can turn on a dime... They didn't even have, as I'm told, they didn't even have the instructional materials ready. They didn't have any kind of training programs. Remember a lot of states had developed their own standards and they'd been teaching to those standards. And they had a full industry that was training teachers to understand what was going to be tested. And then along comes Common Core and you're expected to turn on a dime. It was very upsetting to everybody.

&gt;Filler:So you wouldn't say don't do it, you would say do it right.

&gt;Clinton:Do it right. Do it right and I would say I think we need better and fewer tests that are used for what tests should be used for, first and foremost as to how to improve the educational outcomes for individual children, for classes of children, and for schools of children.

&gt;Filler: Should they be used at all to determine whether teachers are being successful?

&gt;I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001, and continue to oppose the bill's reliance on ***high-stakes standardized testing*** to direct draconian interventions. In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on ***standardized testing***, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.

This is high,y naive: students can reach the goals they set for themselves, based on their interests and ability by working hard.
The downside of the European system is that it creates a class society where people at a young age are labeled and start acting and oerforming accordingly. Also, the level of the teachers at the lower level schools is lower because frankly most teachers don't want to work there, because of the behavioral issues. The other downside is that it is negatively biased towards boys, who tend to be behind in development and organizational skills, compared to their female peers. I know tons of freshmen that would have been put in the lower level schools because they can't even bring a pencil with them, who turned out responsible and dilligent seniors a few years later.

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in 2014 in connection with the Omnitel Transaction. The 2014 effective income tax rate also included a benefit from the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership prior to the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

Greenhouse is a former chief contracting officer Senior Executive Service (Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. On June 27, 2005, she testified to a Congressional panel, alleging specific instances of waste, fraud, and other abuses and irregularities by Halliburton with regard to its operations in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. She described one of the Halliburton contracts (secret, no-bid contracts awarded to Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR)—a subsidiary of Halliburton) as ""the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career"".[1]

&gt; A long-time government employee, Greenhouse was hired by Lieutenant General Joe Ballard in 1997 to oversee contracts at the Army Corps of Engineers. After Ballard retired in 2000, Greenhouse's performance reviews, which had been exemplary throughout her public career, suddenly soured. Greenhouse filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint alleging race and gender discrimination, which her attorney states has never been investigated. In August 2005, she was demoted in what her lawyer called an ""obvious reprisal"" for her revelations about the Halliburton contracts.[2][3]

The real crime is that anyone listens to anything any Democrat has to say on firearms and firearms policy. As a matter of course, the standard assumption is that everything they say is dishonest or at best a half-truth. Sadly, this is not a hyperbolic statement or exaggeration in any way. Which is especially frustrating because there are so many very knowledgeable people who know law, Constitution, research studies, and history, who can accurately discuss public policy and even societal root causes. Heck, a huge number of laymen know the subject matter far, far better than most Democrats attempting to make public policy and law. Take time to ponder that.

To give you an idea of how completely backwards political arena is on firearms, consider the following. When people want expert opinion, they go to experts. When Democrats want expert opinion on firearms and policy, they go to politicians. Which is painfully obvious why, as the experts contradict just about everything Democrat politicians have to say on the subject. Which brings us full circle to my opening sentence.

Some argue that big names such as Clinton are not persuaded by money due to their enormous influence and already established wealth, but this is very much *not* true for lesser known politicians. If anything, giving politicians and the democratic party MORE money from such groups is exacerbating an already existing problem. They will be knocking on doors for favors once elections are done.

Also, why do you think doing the same strategy of fundraising that's lost us both sides of congress, as well as numerous gubernatorial and legislative branches across the nation, will suddenly start to win? There is a massive progressive movement that has begun, made up of millions of people OUTSIDE the party and young people who don't typically vote. If the Democrats could harness that energy, and seal up up these votes in elections, that in itself would lend enormous power to taking back Congress. 

Some people mock Sanders for putting his need of getting things done in Congress partially on this movement, but the fact of the matter is that without it and regardless of who is in the White House, we can assure ourselves that a repeat of obstructionism we've seen for the last several years will continue.

If the Democratic front-runner got her way, corporations would have to disclose their political donations. However, the heart of the matter is far more complex. Her plan doesn’t change that money is speech, nor does it involve tightening the rules of what constitutes “social welfare.” It does not do anything towards regulating 501c4 nonprofits, which would still be able to hide their donors. “Issue advocacy” would still be largely unchecked. Like in the example I gave above, wealthy individuals like the Koch Brothers, who are corporate interests, would still be able to run political “issue” ads through nonprofits with benign names, hiding their identities while pushing a corporate agenda.

- Enabling pharmaceutical companies to unduly influence government health programs and pricing and reimbursement decisions;

- Requiring countries to grant additional 20-year patents for modifications of existing medicines;

- Providing data and market exclusivity periods that create additional monopoly protections and block introduction of generic competitors, even when there is no patent on a medicine;

- Longer period of protection for biologic medicines—such as monoclonal antibodies that are rapidly becoming the treatment of choice for many cancers, diabetes and other illnesses; and 

- Allowing pharmaceutical companies to sue the US or other governments if health policies or government regulations are alleged to deprive them of anticipated profits. ","Reddit"

"7204",1460512183,"Am I reading this graph right that there are a lot fewer less-wealthy people and more rich people now vs 1971?  

Other than the lowest income smallest histogram bin, it seems like everyone is better off.  Fewer in the low income bins (under the blue line), more in the high income bins (above the blue line)  If it was a case of purely income inequality growth, the distribution would have gotten a lot more u-shaped.

Edit: I continue to struggle with what point Bernie is trying to make here.  He dislikes that there's more people in the higher income bracket?  There's fewer people in the lower income brackets, which seems like a really great outcome.  The lowest one does increase.  Assuming the bins are even spaced, that would be &gt;$5k.  I wonder what kind of folks are there.  That increase is offset greatly by the decreases in the other ""low income"" bins, though.  The ""middle income"" highlighted area moving up the money axis even conveniently points that out.

Edit2: it seems people don't realize that the y-axis is ""percentage of people"".  When that rightmost bar grows, it's because more and more people are making &gt;$200k, not that the top percentage of people is taking more of the wealth.

This graph does not show the highest earners income skyrocketing, it shows the number of people who make over $200K skyrocketing, and people's average income rising, which I think we can all agree is a good thing.

"7265",1460496927,"What annoys me is that all of the voting rights bluster is in the end hypocritical and self-serving.

On the subject of voter ID laws, even if an ID is free and simple to get, we hear INCESSANTLY that it's voter suppression, biased against minorities/the poor/the elderly/immigrants, etc. It's a high-minded and moral crusade. 

I happen to agree that voters IDs are not a good idea, actually.

But boy, when you get to the Democratic (or Republican) **primary**, you are expected to know every rule, regulation, deadline, form, subform, fee, and location. If you trip up on a requirement or start too late, that's on you. YOU should know better, YOU should have been prepared. It's suddenyl not about your rights, it's about your responsibility, your preparation - whether you are *worthy* of placing that vote.

So when we're in the general, having a free ID on you is an unfair and onerous burden, but it's totally fair in a primary to make folks jump through a million little hoops, to be an expert on the process, and to have been preparing in some cases months ago.

Let's be honest - it's because easy voting in the general favors Dems, and difficult voting in the primary favors the default candidate. So, fine. But don't be up in my grill about someone's voting rights when you're taking the complete opposite view during the primary. I see your hypocrisy a mile away.

The default answer to this is ""Parties are private, primaries are private, they can do whatever they want.""

Interview: http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-hillary-clinton-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2596292?cid=bitly

&gt; **Daily News**: Secretary Clinton, I'd like to ask you if I can about Latin-America and the policies specifically you were directly involved in, the coup in Honduras. As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn't do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias adeal for new elections.

&gt; But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There's been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?             
               
&gt; **Clinton**: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now I didn't like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent the military to take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people, and that triggers a legal necessity. There's no way to get around it. So our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow walk and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of without calling it a coup.

&gt; So you're right. I worked very hard with leaders in the region and got Oscar Arias, the Nobel Prize winner, to take the lead on trying to broker a resolution. Without bloodshed. And that was very important to us that… Zelaya had friends and allies not just in Honduras but in some of the neighboring countries like Nicaragua, and that we could have had a terrible civil war that would have been just terrifying in its loss of life.

&gt; So I think we came out with a solution that did hold new elections, but it did not in any way address the structural, systemic problems in that society. And I share your concern that it's not just government actions. Drug gangs, traffickers of all kinds are preying on the people of Honduras.

&gt; So I think we need to do more of a Colombian plan for Central America, because remember what was going in Colombia when first my husband and then followed by President Bush had Plan Colombia, which was to try to use our leverage to rein in the government in their actions against the FARC and the guerillas, but also to help the government stop the advance of the FARC and guerillas.

&gt; And now we're in the middle of peace talks. It didn't happen overnight. It took a number of years, but I want to see a much more comprehensive approach towards Central America because it's just Honduras. The highest murder rate is in El Salvador and we've got Guatemala with all the problems you know so well.

&gt; So I think in retrospect we managed a very difficult situation without bloodshed, without a civil war that led to a new election, and I think that was better for the Honduran people, but we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with violence and the gangs and so much else.","Reddit"
"7309",1460506779,"I want to know how many people in this sub have actually *been* to Honduras.

I've been many times before and since the coup.  It's a nation full of very proud and very poor people.  We are talking about a people so proud that they fill in their own potholes after church services.  They sweep the sidewalks.  They are performing their own ""civil service"" for nothing, or for the donation of a few Lempiras.  Valuta through an invalid  and outdated currency, but it is still used.  Worth about US $0.05 for each ""Lemp.""  Yeah, a nickel donation.

Local police are often dependent on donated vehicles or taxi rides to go out to calls.

The locals help to build their own schools and they are rightfully proud of it.

The coup was long coming.  The country is very slowly recovering.  They have very little money to work with, but they budget it carefully.

"7331",1460563552,"I really don't understand Sanders on this. Let's go through the checklist.

Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote, and looking ahead into the remaining primaries, will likely only extend that.  And yes, even with the caucuses included, it's still over a 2.4 million vote difference in favor of her. [Source.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/04/06/is-hillary-clinton-really-ahead-of-bernie-sanders-by-2-5-million-votes/)

Hillary Clinton is currently winning the pledged delegate count by over 200, and once again, will only be continuing to add to that in the remaining states. [Source.](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/democrats/)

So, let's take a minute and look beyond this. Let's look beyond Sanders asking the superdelegates to go against the popular vote and delegate count, which is not at all how they work and would be completely undemocratic. Let's say they consider it.

Bernie just became a democrat in [November](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/23/bernie-sanders-democrat/)and did it for coverage. Meanwhile, Hillary was campaigning for democrats as early as [1968.](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/11/395302391/5-things-you-should-know-about-hillary-clinton)

Hillary Clinton has raised [millions](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/clinton-sanders-differ-down-ballot-democrats) for the democratic party, Bernie Sanders has raised 0.

Bernie Sanders says [""We'll see""](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/bernie-sanders-fundraise-down-ballot-democrats-maddow) if he will fund raise for down ticket Democrats in the future. 

Bernie Sanders wanted someone to challenge the incumbent Democratic president in [2012.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/martin-omalley/fact-checking-martin-omalleys-claim-bernie-sanders/)

So, once again. Let's say that in some miracle chance  they overlook the popular vote, delegate count, the fact that Bernie has been a vocal non-democrat until it suited him, the fact that he wanted someone to run against a sitting democratic president, the fact that he has done nothing to raise money for the party and says ""we'll see"" about doing it in the future. Oh, and don't forget that he's now giving the republicans sound bites to air against Clinton in the general (""She is unqualified!"") Even *if* that were to happen, as the article says, he'd still be losing! 

 And, before I get swarmed by angry Bernie fans, yes I know this isn't *technically* over yet and  that polls may change, but the writing is on the wall. Why do you think Sanders himself is pushing this superdelegate nonsense? He knows full and well that it is his only hail mary chance of getting the nomination. At the end of the day, Bernie joined a party - and he is subject to their rules like anyone else is. If he didn't like the system, he could have ran as an independent. ","Reddit"

"7365",1460565893,"Some key points for people who are too lazy to read past the title. 

&gt;There’s no question that by the early 1990s, blacks wanted an immediate response to the crime, violence and drug markets in their communities. But even at the time, many were asking for something different from the crime bill. Calls for tough sentencing and police protection were paired with calls for full employment, quality education and drug treatment, and criticism of police brutality.

&gt;It’s not just that those demands were ignored completely. It’s that some elements were elevated and others were diminished — what we call selective hearing. Policy makers pointed to black support for greater punishment and surveillance, without recognizing accompanying demands to redirect power and economic resources to low-income minority communities.

&gt;Black support for anti-crime legislation was highlighted, while black criticism of the specific legislation was tuned out. ","Reddit"
"7366",1460566465,"&gt;Voting records show that many black lawmakers supported some of the most punitive drug-war-era laws in America. But even some people who have long opposed harsh sentencing laws understand where supporters were coming from. The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a longtime pastor in New York, once was addicted to heroin and served time. He's convinced that black leaders who embraced the drug war did serious harm to the community, but says a lot of African-Americans were desperate for ways to make their neighborhoods safe again. ""If you're the victim, then you don't want to hear anything about treatment, just, 'Get this guy off the street.' ""
But eventually, even some of the staunchest supporters of mandatory minimums saw that these policies had badly backfired, in part because they lumped addicts and small-time dealers with drug kingpins and violent gang leaders. And they also consigned countless African-American men to prisons across the country.

"7384",1460485500,"Woah there. Gary Gensler isn't merely an ""ex-Goldman Sachs partner"", he's the current CFO and top financial policy adviser of Clinton's presidential campaign, and was a prominent Treasury official under Clinton. 

During his work in the Treasury in the late 90s and early 2000s, he was a key figure in working with Phil Gramm, under Bill Clinton, to revise and sneak the Enron loophole-plagued CFMA into the 2001 omnibus appropriations bill in the last days of the congressional session.

The fact that Clinton hired this guy as one of her top advisers and managers of her national campaign has been very concerning to essentially anyone that has read into this over the past year. 

Better yet, when she hides behind Obama in defense of her enormous financial support from Wall Street, there's a particularly damning fact here: In 2008, congressional Democrats patched up much of the revised CFMA's damage, especially the Enron loophole. In 2009, Obama appointed this guy to chair of the CFTC, the very role which he was instrumental in deregulating via his crucial work in getting the revised (loophole and deregulation-ridden) CFMA passed.

Should be noted that Sanders heavily argued against approving Gensler to chair of the CFTC back in 2009: http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4538740/sen-bernie-sanders-objects-gary-gensler

So not only does Obama's terrible record of financial sector regulation act as a fairly poor excuse for Clinton to raise tens of millions from the same people, but it's all escalated when she decided to hire one of the key players in taking the CFMA from a proper modernization of regulatory provisions to a deregulatory bill (with the Enron loophole) as her top financial policy adviser and campaign CFO.","Reddit"

You could kill parts of the deal like Bernie wanted in the first place, as a start.

&gt;Question: Should the United States lead a ground force — including U.S. troops — to take Raqqa?

No. More troops = perpetual warfare = more american deaths = more ""Patriotizing"" of foreign nations = more troops on ground = repeat cycle.

&gt;Question: Should the United States return to the Cold War approach of supporting autocratic regimes — in Egypt, for example — in search of more stability?

Obviously not; why is this even in question?

&gt;Question: How do you propose to avoid continued gridlock and dysfunction? Or will you aim for confrontation, and organize your presidency around the goal of capturing both houses of Congress in 2018?

You need to help the people elect people with the people in their best interest. Right now we have a majority who have corporations in their best interest, not the people. Only two candidates have that type of enthusiasm, and Clinton is not one of them.

&gt;Bonus question: What are the biggest mistakes Obama has made, and what have you learned from them?

&gt;Sanders aides told reporters that he may not be able to catch Hillary Clinton through the primary/caucus delegate process, but the campaign might come close, at which point Team Bernie might ask superdelegates to give Sanders the nomination anyway, even if he’s trailing Clinton after voters have had their say.
&gt;
&gt;On the show last night, Rachel asked the senator himself about the possibility. Initially, Sanders responded by talking about his optimism regarding upcoming contests and some national polling, but he didn’t answer the question directly.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again whether he might try to convince superdelegates to side with him, even if he’s behind in pledged delegates. Sanders said he and his campaign are “going to do the best we can in any and every way to win,” but he still avoided comment on the specific approach he’s prepared to take.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again. For those who missed it, this was the exchange that stood out.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;MADDOW: I’m just going to push you and ask you one more time. I’ll actually ask you from the other direction. If one of you – presumably, there won’t be a tie – one of you presumably will be behind in pledged delegates heading into that convention. Should the person who is behind in pledged delegates concede to the person who is ahead in pledged delegates in Philadelphia?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;SANDERS: Well, I – you know, I don’t want to speculate about the future and I think there are other factors involved. I think it is probably the case that the candidate who has the most pledged delegates is going to be the candidate, but there are other factors.","Reddit"

&gt; In a February 25 editorial, The New York Times argued that Clinton’s “stonewalling” on the Goldman transcripts “plays into the hands of those who say she’s not trustworthy and makes her own rules” and “most important, is damaging her credibility among Democrats who are begging her to show them that she’d run an accountable and transparent White House.” But the Times editorial did not get to the heart of the matter. The larger question is, Why was she giving these speeches at all—and accepting such hefty payments for them—given Goldman Sachs’s record during the Great Recession of 2007–2008?

&gt; Set alongside such stricken competitors as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, Goldman and its CEO Lloyd Blankfein are the great survivors of the crash: **they actually came out ahead in their own derivatives trading during those years.** Goldman and Blankfein’s admirers, including many in the financial media, have for the most part ignored the bank’s activities during the crash, despite multiple investigations and billion-dollar penalties against Goldman for its aggressive and deceptive marketing of financial derivatives. This has included a $5 billion settlement levied against the bank this January. **How does this fit with Clinton’s self-portrayal as an opponent of the big banks and their excesses who is committed to their reform?**

&gt; ...

&gt; As the primary season reaches the crucial contests in the northeast and in California that will likely decide the ultimate victor, the dual history linking Goldman and the Clintons poses two questions that still need to be answered. First, should Lloyd Blankfein remain CEO of Goldman Sachs in view of the bank’s central involvement in the deceptive marketing of securities during the crash? Second, should he, and Goldman, remain the valued associates of Hillary Clinton, with both Clintons receiving inflated speaking fees from Goldman, and with Hillary Clinton performing what amounts to a high-end public relations effort for the bank, even as she styles herself as a reformer of the financial industry? **As long as Clinton refuses to reveal the content of her Goldman speeches, the suspicion will remain that she has cast a blind eye on Goldman’s dark years and that her campaign pledge to “rein in Wall Street” cannot be taken seriously.**","Reddit"

"7486",1460613758,"Oh, he could do it.  Slap a tariff on all incoming products to raise their price to make them inline with what a person in the US making the same product costs.  Prices would go up, but you'd have jobs.   Of course, you'd have to put tariff on products from US companies to prevent them from moving the same jobs overseas.  You'd then have you're manufacturing producing all the products that the US needs.  Because the prices have gone up (remember the 40% tariff on Ford?) the demand for the products would go down as few people could afford few products.   Basic economics there.  And out products would no longer be even remotely competitive on the international market, which would split marketing between the US and overseas -- so the companies moving jobs overseas would continue to move jobs overseas and selling those products overseas to avoid the tariffs (last time I checked, ford just didn't sell cars in the US, but all over the world including China).    So you'd get jobs, but the prices would be higher, demand would go down, reducing the job growth -- up until the companies could automate the production in the US -- at which time the jobs would disappear again.  

But -- by golly we gains some jobs for a little while.

This is stupid and they have just lost credibility with me.","Reddit"
"7544",1460648836,"Let me try to address a few things in the article.  

&gt;“Since the tragedy in Sandy Hook, more than 500 children have lost their lives to gun violence in this country.

I'm not going to claim this is untrue.  I will ask, ""what specific changes to the law would have prevented all children who have died since Sandy Hook from dying?""  We have lost children in hot cars, but they are not trying to ban cars in the summer.  We have lost children in swimming pools, but I don't see them trying to ban swimming pools. We've lost children to ""shaken baby syndrome"" when cared for by babysitters, but I don't see them trying to make it illegal to babysit without background checks and proof of child-care training.

Losing children to gun violence is just one small way we lose children, and not the largest cause of child death.  It's used here as an example because, well, most people have an emotional response to the thought of dead children.  ""oh, if we just made more laws, then drug dealers would not shoot bystanders with illegally obtained guns as part of their illegal turf wars...""  

&gt;A few months after the Sandy Hook tragedy, the Senate rejected a bill that would have expanded FBI checks of gun purchasers to include sales by individuals on the internet and at guns shows.

This would probably be because it's already illegal to sell guns to anonymous people over the internet.  Dealers who sell at gun shows must already do background checks.  Private individuals who do not have businesses selling firearms are **not able** to perform background checks, no matter where they sell their guns, because they are barred from using the NICS.  What is being proposed here is making it illegal to buy and sell guns unless one is a dealer, or goes through a dealer with a full background check for every sale.  That's the ""gun show loophole"" that they want.  The physical location of a sale, being in one's home or at a gun show, isn't actually part of the ""gun show"" loophole; that's just a convenient bit of misdirection that anti-gun advocates use to confuse low information voters.  It should be termed the ""private sale loophole,"" where they want private sales of property governed by the feds.

&gt;Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., spoke about a bill he and Murphy introduced earlier this year that would repeal a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers and dealers from liability when crimes are committed with their products.

If we ignore the idea that this targets the firearm manufacturers specifically and just think of these as ""manufactured devices,"" then it becomes clear that they are asking for it to be illegal to sue General Motors if someone speeds in a General Motors car.  Or, sue a pharmaceutical company if someone overdoses with a drug - any drug.  Too much aspirin? Sue Bayer, because they make aspirin.  Is that foolish?  They want to sue the company that makes the guns that the police use if someone commits a crime with the kind of gun the police use.  That's clearly what they want.  Should the companies that supply the police be at jeopardy every time they sell the police a weapon, if that weapon is stolen and then used to kills someone?  That's very bad legislation, and should not have been considered.  This is what the riders here want to be passed.  

&gt;Blumenthal said the “abhorrent” law “closes the courtroom doors” to lawsuits like the one filed by some of the parents of the children killed in Newtown against the maker of the Bushmaster rifle that was used by Adam Lanza in the massacre.

Last year (or the year before) an FBI Agent lost his service firearm and it ended up on a Pier in San Francisco.  It was then used to kill a young lady, seemingly at random.  I suppose it should be okay to hold the manufacturer of that firearm accountable for her death?

A company's incorporation is about as significant as the area code on your cell phone.

North Carolina will lose millions because businesses that offer high-paying jobs won't set up shop in a state where bigotry is the law of the land.  North Carolina's hospitality industry will also lose millions because because convention planners won't do business with the state for the same reason.  They refuse to send their clients into hostile territory.

The state could very well lose additional millions defending this law, with taxpayers ultimately footing the bill.

"7818",1460518661,"He stands to benefit from this trip more than the other candidates, Dem or Republican, would.

First, there are voters who decided to support Hillary many months ago, back when Bernie was relatively unknown, who haven't felt motivated to revisit that decision.  They recognize Bernie's name and might know a few superficial things about him, but they don't know enough to evaluate him as a candidate.  Bernie's invitation to the Vatican is unique and interesting enough to inspire some of them to look him up and learn a bit more about who he is.

Next, the problems of greed and inequality are at the core of Bernie's message.  The same is true of Pope Francis.  While Francis has not endorsed Bernie, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to notice that similarity.  This will cause more voters to view Bernie's platform from a moral perspective instead of a purely economic or political perspective (i.e., not just, ""Would it be good for me?"" or ""Is it politically possible?"" but, ""Is it the right thing to do?"").  It will surely cause some people to view his message in a religious context.

And that is especially important for Bernie, the first non-Christian presidential candidate that I'm aware of, certainly the first to get this far.  The media doesn't talk about it, but we all know that he's lost some votes because he's Jewish.  A nod from the Vatican, however slight, is just what he needs to soften that prejudice.

Finally, he has been constantly diminished by the media.  This Vatican trip elevates him; he'll be attending alongside heads of state.  He is the first US presidential candidate in history to receive such an invitation.  It will make him seem more presidential and impressive.","Reddit"

Why has such a large chunk of the party that settled on Bill Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry suddenly decided they’d rather have a ritual re-enactment of the McGovern campaign?""

I mean, let's not pretend that this paragraph is a gross distortion to what's factually true. Clinton is losing ground solely because of herself, that's the bottom line. The reason Bernie is gaining so much traction with the American people is because he is the most honest and trustworthy candidate in the race. He is the only one who is willing to address the real issues we face today. He strongly advocated tax reform and campaign donation reform. Ever since Ronald Reagan the country has been going through a state of deregulation of big business. Every president that succeeded the last has deregulated the system making it easier and easier for big business to gain more and more influence. Citizens United and the whole super pac problem needs to be addressed and Bernie is the only one advocating it...while Clinton takes millions from big business with open arms. 

We now live in a society far different from what we were told. Ever since I started school I was told we lived in a democratic republic based on capitalism. This is far from the truth. We live in a society where the 1% are the ones who bribe candidates and use these candidates to solely benefit them. To my knowledge this kind of system is called an Oligarchy. We were born into an oligarchy without even knowing and we believed it up until now.

When it comes to the debates and especially the town halls, in which tickets were given out by the campaigns, there are always instances where Hillary looks out into the crowd in the middle of a response and says something like ""I think *so and so* is here, yes, he/she is"" and then goes on to talk up something her and that person have worked on together or at least a way to hoist up that person to the audience and TV viewers. This does many things. One of the most prominent examples was when, during a town hall in South Carolina, she asked mothers who had lost children to gun violence to stand up. The camera panned out, showed the several mothers, and there was an extended period of applause.

Being that this will be in NY, I expect her Sen. Schumer to be in the audience, as well as Cuomo and especially de Blasio. She will point to them for things like the $15 minimum wage, lower crime rates, stricter gun laws (to then hit Bernie). There will also be city council members and borough presidents, who she will also find a way to connect to and bring attention to them. This is how you build loyalty and ensure that they (considering some are super delagates) continue to support you no matter what.

&gt;However, that doesn’t mean the rules won’t be tinkered with before convention ballots are cast. The convention’s own rules committee, which is made up of delegates as well as party officials, will be able to make changes before the convention doors opens.

"8117",1460558970,"&gt;Approximately 9.7 million people got insurance through healthcare.gov this year.

&gt;That’s a decent income in most parts of the country, and it’s why 85 percent of healthcare.gov consumers got at least some assistance. They are the ones who, on average, are paying just 4 percent more for their insurance than they were last year.

"8157",1460647637,"[My comment from another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4er2zx/the_bernie_sanders_double_standard/), this seems to be the narrative of the week:

&gt; He forgets to mention that 28 other Democratic senators also voted for that resolution, including Joe Biden and John Kerry. 

Well, he is running against only HRC at the moment, so he is just contrasting between himself and HRC.

&gt; Clinton has said many times that she made a mistake on that Iraq War vote. 

This is why her judgement is called to question, because Libya still happened, if she truly believed Iraq was a mistake then Libya would not have repeated those same mistakes.

&gt; Again, notice that Sanders rarely mentions Obama’s name as a target of criticism, such as for the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But he does strongly criticize Clinton for changing her mind after her early support of the TPP,

Again, Sanders is running against Clinton not Obama, why should he contrast himself with Obama?

Frankly this more than anything he had said exposes him as an ideologue who prioritizes his vision for the country over the well-being of the people who actually have to live here. 

I know that sounds ridiculous. But:

On the economics: fracking as a technique has driven an enormous supply shock in both oil and nat gas industries. That means lower prices for any given volume of demand. That means a giant progressive tax reduction since poor people spend proportionately more on fuel, power, and hearing. 

More consequentially, before people knew you could extract oil and gas from source rock using fracking, people thought you would have to get it from very difficult to reach reserves like deepwater, the Arctic, and oil sands. Those reserves are dangerous to work and our technology sometimes led to very large problems (eg deepwater horizon and Macondo). Moreover, many of those reserves are in bad places that are hard to regulate. 

Fracking has led to a collapse in prices and a huge shift of capital and drilling away from these reserves, usually owned by national oil companies in states that don't like us or that we wouldn't want to support, to the US. If fracking went away, we'd be back to $100 oil, $7 gas, and massive rent extraction by Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Saudis, etc. 

The US reserves are a very powerful strategic weapon. We should be approving gas export terminals every time Putin gets nasty to put pressure on the Russian dominance of European gas. We are already pressuring bad actors everywhere. I don't want American soldiers defending petrostates that are despicable because we need the resources. Now, with fracking, we largely don't. 

On the environments, no question fracking is worse than solar or wind. But if regulated properly it can be made at least palatable and still be economically viable. And having access to cheap natural gas domestically allows us to transition faster from coal and build rapid firing gas plants to make up for wind or solar facilities if the wind stops or it gets cloudy. 

Prospectively, a world with fracking is a world where we can pass a carbon tax and still take revenues and power away from bad state actors and exceptionally dirty resource plays and manage it closely in the US. I want us to be off oil and gas in 40 years for fuel and heating and power -- that would be the bulk of the use, though it doesn't solve cow farts-- and I want us to use our own resource for as much of that time as possible. If we support domestic production and implement good regulations plus a carbon tax, you will get both a rapid transition away from fossil fuels and a safer planet.

""Hillary Clinton has won in the popular vote by a wide margin. She’s got more than 2 million votes over Sen. Sanders in all of the contests when you add them all up.""

As the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/democratic-superdelegates-pressured-to-shift-stance-after-string-of-sanders-wins-1459902173) points out here, democrats are wondering why their state's superdelegates are rigging the system for Hillary, despite many, many Sanders landslides:
&gt;Mr. Sanders’s recent victories in Colorado, Hawaii, Washington, Alaska and elsewhere have left some other Democrats defending their decision to back Mrs. Clinton at the party’s convention in Philadelphia this July.

There are ""progressive"" politicians who want to divide the next inevitable step into ever smaller steps. That way they can keep something to campaign with for next time, and a way to make it seem like their party has a pattern or track record of working on whatever the issue is (guns, environment, healthcare).  

If they had passed gun reform rather than making small incremental moves toward it (a bullet here, a bullet there), than we'd have a lot less politicians who could claim to have ""worked on gun reform"" over the past few decades.  But we'd have gun reform.  

But they don't want to give us everything all at once.  It would add a level of uncertainty to the future of the party that they can't commit to.

This is what's happening with Single Payer Healthcare.  There are politicians that don't want to give up the potential to run on ""working towards single payer"" for the next few elections.  They want to step on it, break it down into smaller parts, cut it (with some stuff that gets their donors paid), and give us the most diluted form of healthcare that we will buy.

&gt;Sanders aides told reporters that he may not be able to catch Hillary Clinton through the primary/caucus delegate process, but the campaign might come close, at which point Team Bernie might ask superdelegates to give Sanders the nomination anyway, even if he’s trailing Clinton after voters have had their say.
&gt;
&gt;On the show last night, Rachel asked the senator himself about the possibility. Initially, Sanders responded by talking about his optimism regarding upcoming contests and some national polling, but he didn’t answer the question directly.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again whether he might try to convince superdelegates to side with him, even if he’s behind in pledged delegates. Sanders said he and his campaign are “going to do the best we can in any and every way to win,” but he still avoided comment on the specific approach he’s prepared to take.
&gt;
&gt;So, Rachel asked again. For those who missed it, this was the exchange that stood out.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;MADDOW: I’m just going to push you and ask you one more time. I’ll actually ask you from the other direction. If one of you – presumably, there won’t be a tie – one of you presumably will be behind in pledged delegates heading into that convention. Should the person who is behind in pledged delegates concede to the person who is ahead in pledged delegates in Philadelphia?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;SANDERS: Well, I – you know, I don’t want to speculate about the future and I think there are other factors involved. I think it is probably the case that the candidate who has the most pledged delegates is going to be the candidate, but there are other factors.

&gt;Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine made the case Wednesday on a call with reporters that, despite pledged delegates getting their spots based on Democratic votes in primaries and caucuses, they are free to switch which candidate they represent based on personal preference. He pointed to the Jimmy Carter campaign in 1980 and said that before Carter won the Democratic nomination, the campaign was “deeply concerned about the defection of pledged delegates.”
&gt;
&gt;“We don’t have a plan at the moment to be calling all the Clinton delegates, you know, once they get selected and try to persuade them individually to be for Bernie Sanders,” Devine said when pressed by a reporter. “But we do believe that if we can succeed in the second half of the process as much as Hillary did or even more so, that there will be enormous pressure on people who are going to be delegates at this convention to do the right, responsible thing.”","Reddit"

If people took the time to read the article and see the video, the evidence is apparent that the system is rigged in Hillary's favor.


&gt; Although Sanders won by 12 percent, however, Clinton ultimately won more total delegates. Factoring in superdelegates, Clinton won 11 and Sanders won just seven.



&gt; But it was not just the superdelegate count that was unfair. There are 14 pledged delegates in Wyoming, meaning, given Sanders won 56 percent of the vote, if the voting system were proportional, he should have gotten at least eight delegates.



&gt; In the end, however, Sanders and Clinton tied on pledged delegates. Sanders, who won the primary by 12 percent, won the same number of pledged delegates as Clinton, who lost by 12 percent.

Let's see all of the spin doctors take on the fact that Clinton didn't read the 92-page intelligence report on Iraq before her vote on the Iraq war. Let's see if they that carries any weight on her ability to be a good decision maker as the president.   

[She didn't read the intelligence report on Iraq before the vote.](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/01/us-intelligence-on-wmds-in-iraq/) 

No more than six senators and a handful of House members read beyond the five-page National Intelligence Estimate executive summary, according to several congressional aides responsible for safeguarding the classified material.

Among those who later admitted to not reading the full report were Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Chris Dodd, and Republican Sens. Sam Brownback and John McCain. All of them voted in favor of the war resolution, and all later ran for their respective party’s 2008 presidential nomination. ","Reddit"

"9195",1460641026,"&gt; Sanders knows that President Obama took large donations from Wall Street and had a big political action committee.

Has no relevancy whatsoever, especially considering that many have criticized Obama's positions with respect to Wall St.

&gt; And Sanders omits the undisputed facts that both Obama and Clinton take positions strongly opposed by Wall Street interests

Perhaps this is true with respect to the single issues they go on to cite but with respect to the totality of their positions on Wall St. it certainly is disputed whether they are strongly opposed.

&gt; Sanders also never mentions that Paul Krugman, the Pulitzer-prize winning progressive columnist for The New York Times, has described Clinton’s stance on Wall Street reforms and accountability as more effective than Sanders’s proposals.

This is how you know the author is being absurd. Why the fuck would Sanders acknowledge what one economist thinks of his *opponent's* stance on Wall St. unprovoked?

&gt; The Iraq War vote: Sanders says this showed flawed judgment by Clinton when she voted for the war resolution 13 years ago. But here’s the undeniable double standard: He forgets to mention that 28 other Democratic senators also voted for that resolution, including Joe Biden and John Kerry. Does Sanders say the vice president and the secretary of State, both of whom served multiple terms in the U.S. Senate, are not qualified to be president, because of flawed judgment? Even once? No.

More ""they did it too so it must be OK"". This author has the critical thinking skills of a child.

&gt; Supporting virtually every trade agreement: Again, notice that Sanders rarely mentions Obama’s name as a target of criticism, such as for the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

AND AGAIN. This is kindergarten shit.

The majority of this person's argument is ""Krugman praised Clinton so she must be doing something right"" and ""others do it too"". How are people this devoid of critical thinking skills employed?","Reddit"

&gt; Clinton has said many times that she made a mistake on that Iraq War vote. 

This is why her judgement is called to question, because Libya still happened, if she truly believed Iraq was a mistake then Libya would not have repeated those same mistakes.

&gt; Again, notice that Sanders rarely mentions Obama’s name as a target of criticism, such as for the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But he does strongly criticize Clinton for changing her mind after her early support of the TPP,

Gross negligence is a different standard than negligence.  Negligence is the failure to use ordinary care.  Gross negligence is reckless conduct that is much more culpable than negligence.

Many states criminalize gross negligence that injures a person, but I don't think any criminalize ordinary negligence.  So if you are in a car wreck you might be liable if you were negligent (not paying attention, for example).  But it is only criminal if it is gross negligence, which would be driving 100 mph in a school zone or driving with your eyes closed or something like that.

Mukasey is making it sound like Clinton would be guilty is she were careless, when the gross negligence requirement is much higher than that.","Reddit"

I am on the fence on both of these candidates. But I can tell you one thing, it is extremely hard to overlook Hillary's habit of passing the buck; it's never her fault. She also has a habit of putting political gain ahead of ethics, of compromising her own stances for her own benefit, and has a track record of sub-par decision making.

Bernie is a one-issue candidate, and I don't agree with him on everything.

In todays world, the president would never win re-election with his health in question, and the press that covered it would be labeled as 'chairgate' conspirators.  That is the state of politics today, and because of how effective it is, it is never going away.

In todays society, we demand that our politicians be pure.  I mistake, and they are gone.  Look at Rudy Giuliani.  That dude had the White House in the bag.  Then, one day, at a press conference, he made the press wait while he took a phone call from his wife.  That one little smug act cost him everything.  His numbers plummeted and he fell away into obscurity.  Look at Romney, he was chugging right along, and then he made a comment about the 47 percent'.  Game over.  Look at McCain... he was busting his ass on the trail, and then instead of picking a beltway insider as his VP, he chose Palin..... game over.

Politics is a fine game of character, and character assassination.  It matters not what you say, if your word is good for nothing.  Those who are willing to turn a blind eye towards a character flaw in a candidate in this day and age..... are going to suffer that person's mistakes.

Great start to the article. It's straight to the point -- anti-trade would cost millions more jobs than free trade. 

&gt;3. Getting tougher on trade would supercharge the U.S. economy.

&gt;Trump’s economic plan boils down to cutting taxes and renegotiating trade deals, including the nonexistent China agreement. He told The Post he could generate revenue to pay off $19 trillion in federal debt within eight years without raising taxes. “The power is trade,” Trump said. “Our deals are so bad.” Sanders suggests the same thing in calling for his own protectionist policies: “We should have a trade policy which represents the working families of this country, that rebuilds our manufacturing base.” **As leverage to cut better deals, Trump has threatened tariffs on China and Mexico. Sanders has also raised the threat of tariffs.**

&gt;Economic models don’t generally predict that such ideas would rev up the U.S. economy, though — quite the opposite. **A model by Moody’s Analytics, prepared at the request of The Post, predicts that Trump-style tariffs would push our economy into recession and throw millions of Americans out of work.** A more optimistic model, from economist J.W. Mason of the Roosevelt Institute, estimates that tariffs would probably reduce America’s gross domestic product by about 1 percent — not a huge effect but also not the growth boom that opponents of free trade predict. ","Reddit"
"9602",1460577297,"That's about right.  Thought to be fair to Sanders, the **underlying** elements that make this a voting issue (income inequality and labor market disruption in long-standing industries) are things democrats actually have an answer for.

"9613",1460618969,"&gt; Detroit, Mich., Jan. 5. -- Henry Ford, head of the Ford Motor Company, announced today one of the most remarkable business moves of his entire remarkable career. In brief it is:
&gt; 
&gt; To give to the employees of the company $10,000,000 of the profits of the 1914 business, the payments to be made semi-monthly and added to the pay checks.
&gt; 
&gt; To run the factory continuously instead of only eighteen hours a day, giving employment to several thousand more men by employing three shifts of eight hours each, instead of only two nine-hour shifts, as at present.
&gt; 
&gt; To establish a minimum wage scale of $5 per day. Even the boy who sweeps up the floors will get that much.
&gt; 
&gt; Before any man in any department of the company who does not seem to be doing good work shall be discharged, an opportunity will be given to him to try to make good in every other department. No man shall be discharged except for proved unfaithfulness or irremediable inefficiency.
&gt; 
&gt; The Ford Company's financial statement of Sept. 20, 1912, showed assets of $20,815,785.63, and surplus of $14,745,095.57. One year later it showed assets of $35,033,919.86 and surplus of $28,124,173.68. Dividends paid out during the year, it is understood, aggregated $10,000,000. The indicated profits for the year, therefore, were about $37,597,312. The company's capital stock authorized and outstanding, is $2,000,000. There is no bond issue.
&gt; 
&gt; About 10 per cent of the employees, boys and women, will not be affected by the profit sharing, but all will have the benefit of the $5 minimum wage. Those among them who are supporting families, however, will have a share similar to the men of more than 22 years of age.
&gt; 
&gt; In all, about 26,000 employees will be affected. Fifteen thousand now are at work in the Detroit factories. Four thousand more will be added by the institution of the eight-hour shift. The other seven thousand employees are scattered all over the world, in the Ford branches. They will share the same as the Detroit employees.
&gt; 
&gt; Personal statements were made by Henry Ford and James Couzens, Treasurer of the company, regarding the move.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is our belief,"" said Mr. Couzens, ""that social justice begins at home. We want those who have helped us to produce this great institution and are helping to maintain it to share our prosperity. We want them to have present profits and future prospects. Thrift and good service and sobriety, all will be enforced and recognized.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Believing as we do, that a division of our earnings between capital and labor is unequal, we have sought a plan of relief suitable for our business. We do not feel sure that it is the best, but we have felt impelled to make a start, and make it now. We do not agree with those employers who declare, as did a recent writer in a magazine in excusing himself for not practicing what he preached, that 'movement toward the bettering of society must be universal.' We think that one concern can make a start and create an example for other employers. That is our chief object.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""If we are obliged,"" said Mr. Ford, ""to lay men off for want of sufficient work at any season we purpose to so plan our year's work that the lay-off shall be in the harvest time, July, August, and September, not in the Winter. We hope in such case to induce our men to respond to the calls of the farmers for harvest hands, and not to lie idle and dissipate their savings. We shall make it our business to get in touch with the farmers and to induce our employees to answer calls for harvest help.
&gt; 
&gt; ""No man will be discharged if we can help it, except for unfaithfulness or inefficiency. No foreman in the Ford Company has the power to discharge a man. He may send him out of his department if he does not make good. The man is then sent to our 'clearing house,' covering all the departments, and is tried repeatedly in other work, until we find the job he is suited for, provided he is honestly trying to render good service.""

"9615",1460503756,"Based on a multilevel analysis of nearly 120,000 observations across 31 countries between 2001 and 2008, we provide novel insights into the moderating effects that economic inequality may have on the distinct roles that human and financial capital play on different types of entrepreneurship. As inequality increases, both forms of capital become weaker deterrents of entry into necessity entrepreneurship, whereas for opportunity entrepreneurship, only financial capital becomes a stronger predictor of entry. We also show that, regardless of inequality levels, both human and financial capital exhibit decreasing marginal returns on the likelihood of entry into necessity entrepreneurship, and that in the case of opportunity entrepreneurship, financial capital exhibits increasing marginal returns. However, inequality does impact the magnitude of marginal returns. Additionally, our statistical analysis provides quantitative support to extant literature arguing that higher levels of economic inequality foster both types of entrepreneurship albeit having a stronger impact on necessity entrepreneurship, and that human and financial capital have distinct effects on entry into necessity versus opportunity entrepreneurship.

"9715",1460478623,"After taking power, the Bush administration declared war on voter fraud, making it a ""top priority"" for federal prosecutors. In 2006, the Bush Justice Department fired several U.S. attorneys who refused to pursue trumped-up cases of voter fraud in New Mexico and Washington. In September 2008, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice stated that some of the dismissals were motivated by the refusal of some of the U.S. Attorneys to prosecute voter fraud cases during the 2006 election cycle. According to Conservatives, community organizers like ACORN were actively recruiting armies of fake voters to misrepresent themselves at the polls and cast illegal ballots for the Democrats. While ACORN was found to have committed fraud, it wasn't any of the type that would affect the outcome of votes. ACORN was found guilty of paying their employees bonuses for registering 21 or more people to vote in a day, or a few employees faked primary petition signatures that overwhelming passed without the fake signatures. Voter ID laws can't stop this, or any other type of voter fraud, except in-person fraudulent voting. In-person voter fraud is when a person or persons use false registrations to obtain ballots and vote one or more times in an election. That is the ONLY type of voter-fraud that can be stopped by voter ID laws.

A major probe by the Justice Department between 2002 and 2007 failed to prosecute a single person for going to the polls and impersonating an eligible voter. Sure, over the 5 years 86 people were convicted, but almost every case were people who mistakenly filled out registration forms or misunderstood eligibility rules. These cases almost exclusively involved immigrants and former felons who didn't know that they were ineligible to vote because of their felony conviction.

There is no significant voter-fraud problem in the United States. Rather, these voter ID laws are rather attempts by Republican majorities to stifle and suppress the number of minorities and poor people who go to the polls. Minorities and the poor just happen to overwhelmingly vote Democratic. I am not even talking about other restrictions, such as removing early voting or making it harder to restore voting rights. Stephen Colbert recently had a fantastic segment in March called ""People who are destroying America"" which was the story of a Florida high school teacher who was fined $1,000 for ""voter registration fraud"" after failing to turn in student voter registration forms within the state's new 48-hour deadline. Now, these measures were tossed out by a Florida Judge who called them ""onerous"", but if the GOP had its way, performing your civic duty can now put you on the wrong side of the law.

This isn't the first instance of Republicans attempting to keep Democrats from voting, especially if you include the southern Democrats who became Republicans after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Republicans trying to drive Democratic voters away from the polls is not something that is new. As Paul Weyrich, the co-Founder of the Heritage Foundation, a Conservative Think-Tank, stated in 1980, ""I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of the people. They never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down."" The American Legislative Exchange Council, the fine people who brought the ""Stand your ground"" laws that became such a big controversy in the Trayvon Martin case, is also the organization that created the template for these voter ID laws. This organization is funded largely by the Koch brothers who were the key bankrollers of the Tea Party movement.

Anyone who has stood on the long lines at the DMV knows that it isn’t easy to get such documents or honestly find the time. My driver's license broke in half earlier this year, and to get it renewed. When I showed up to the DMV and there was literally a line of 42 people. I decided to not wait the estimated two hours and instead come back the next day and give myself plenty of time. I had to wait 3 hours to get my driver's license renewed. Luckily I have a job that is flexible and allowed me to do that--unlike some people. What do you say to the people who work at places like Labor Ready (day labor job center) that begin waiting in line at 4am for work and don't finish until after 7pm? Many of these people work 6-7 days a week at these hours. For working people, obtaining a proper ID could mean giving up a day’s wages, which many can't afford. The New York Times reported:

""A survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that 11 percent of citizens, 21 million people, do not have a current photo ID. That fraction increases to 15 percent of low-income voting-age citizens, 18 percent of young eligible voters and 25 percent of black eligible voters. Those demographic groups tend to vote Democratic, and Republicans are imposing requirements that they know many will be unable to meet.""","Reddit"

&gt; Maybe Clinton was referring to the 551 children Israel killed in Gaza, 68 percent of whom were under the age of 12. Or maybe she was talking about the 844 Palestinians that the Associated Press determined were killed in Israeli airstrikes on residential homes, including 19 babies and 108 preschoolers between the ages of 1 and 5.

This is an intentionally bad reading of Clinton's statement. All she said was that Hamas has disguised its fighters as civilians, making it difficult to tell who is a civilian. But the article makes it out like Clinton is saying that Palestinian babies killed in Israeli airstrikes were asking for it because they resembled Hamas fighters.

For wage discrepancies though, it's been studied and reported on quite a bit (to the attention of very few here) that women are paid the same for the same jobs when their experience and the etc. is the same.

As per [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/karinagness/2016/04/12/dont-buy-into-the-gender-pay-gap-myth/#2ce5481f4766):
&gt;Using the statistic that women make 78 cents on the dollar as evidence of rampant discrimination has been debunked over and over again.

"9991",1460652034,"I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

&gt; The saga continues.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking.

Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

How is this different than your landlord being forced to open your apartment if you are suspected of committing a crime?  Or a cop breaking down your door because he has a warrant?  Or your bank being forced to disclose transactions that may be related to criminal activity?

I'm all for privacy, but if you commit a crime don't you forfeit that right to some extent?  Shouldn't we, as a society, have some mechanism for catching criminals and enforcing laws?  Why should we make it easier for the outlaws and scumbags of our society to hide their activity?

I understand the client-side encryption angle, but it seems that at the end of the day providers wouldn't be held liable for users implementing features not offered by their service.  It would be like the government suing the telephone company because I used their phone line to deal drugs.  They can ask for and subpoena call logs, but can't sue the phone company for my behavior.  It doesn't seem to me that a backdoor would be required if user-side encryption is the problem.

"11116",1460625392,"So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence.

"11811",1460728258,"*Axelrod was equally critical of Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont Senator could offer no specifics on how taking Wall Street money may have unfairly influenced Hillary Clinton’s decision-making.*

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. ","Reddit"

Vermont is a very gun friendly state. Sanders represents the state of Vermont by regularly voting against measures that could restrict gun ownership in any way. He voted against 7 day waiting periods for gun purchases (then against 5 day wait period), he voted against the Brady Bill, he voted in favor of making it harder for ATF to take action against gun shops.        
It is what it is. I've been a supporter of Bernie long before he was ever running for Pres but anyone that thinks Sanders has a pro gun-control/safety record is talking out of their ass.      
If Hillary were smart she would have said ""the NRA has been a supporter of him"", or mentioned specific votes, or quoted Wayne LaPierre on Sanders (""Sanders is an honorable choice for Vermont hunters"" IIRC). Sanders had lost like 4 or 5 elections before getting to Congress, he would have had a much harder time in 1990 if it weren't for the NRA's help ([source](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-05-20/news/9102270272_1_nra-officials-brady-bill-powerful-gun).) And source [for votes... another politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/) titled **""Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases?""**, rated **mostly true**

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

"12121",1460730238,"&gt;Obama’s reticence frustrated Power and others on his national-security team who had a preference for action. **Hillary Clinton, when she was Obama’s secretary of state, argued for an early and assertive response to Assad’s violence.** In 2014, after she left office, Clinton told me that “the failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad … left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.” **When The Atlantic published this statement, and also published Clinton’s assessment that “great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” Obama became “rip-shit angry,”** according to one of his senior advisers. The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro–stupid shit?’ ”The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit. (Clinton quickly apologized to Obama for her comments, and a Clinton spokesman announced that the two would “hug it out” on Martha’s Vineyard when they crossed paths there later.)**

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie.","Reddit"

Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said.

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy.

TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.  She doesn't need to go to jail.. they need to revoke her clearance and boot her ass out of any position of responsibility.","Reddit"

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.

"12779",1460711369,"Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.

Local, regional and national parliaments are then divided based on the corresponding voter percentages. No first past the post shit. No gerrymandering shit. No electoral college shit. It's basic and it works because it's damn hard to corrupt it.

"16032",1460725857,"&gt;But even on this front, the bill now makes a huge misstep with one new addition. Joel Gehrke reports for the Examiner: ""Some Senate Republicans might also be drawn to the bill by the inclusion of 'a mandatory sentencing enhancement for fentanyl crimes,' an addition that could be particular appealing to Sen. Kelly Ayotte, whose home state of New Hampshire is struggling to contain a heroin epidemic.""

&gt;[...]

&gt;In the 1990s, doctors opened up access to opioid painkillers, getting many patients hooked on the drugs. So when officials pulled back access to painkillers, many addicted users didn't just quit the drug; they moved to another opioid, heroin. And now, there are signs that some opioid users are moving on to an opioid that's more powerful and potentially cheaper than painkillers or heroin, fentanyl. And that's all causing more overdose deaths. (For more on the opioid epidemic, check out Vox's explainer.)

&gt;The criminal justice reform bill's solution to this epidemic? A harsher punishment. And that means more nonviolent drug offenders will end up behind bars for long periods of time — particularly for fentanyl.

&gt;The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

Violence against the police only makes people STOP liking you.  You can get your message heard these days, thanks to mass media and social media, so easily.

As soon as you start blocking ambulances and throwing stuff at police, I instantly think you are a scummy person of low intellectual capacity.

Seriously, think about it for a second, what does blocking an ambulance on the street actually do.  What is the purpose of your protest.

I am reminded of Sarah Palin's famous quote; ""*FRUIT FLIES!*""","Reddit"
"19094",1460675176,"Here is the abstract:

&gt;This interdisciplinary research project will advance basic understanding of how tax compliance behavior emerges by focusing on how perceptions of risk and tax fairness form, how these perceptions spread through a social network, and the interplay caused by the complex feedback loops among individual behaviors and population-level outcomes. The project also will address how audit, penalty, and taxation policies, and changes in those policies, influence perceptions and ultimately reduce tax evasion. The project will provide new insights regarding how tax compliance behavior is modified by the perceived aggregated compliance and on how behavior and the perceived aggregated compliance depend on social network structure over which perceptions of taxation spreads. The project will demonstrate the utility of the use of agent-based modeling for research on interactions between individuals and governments as well as how data from the American Life Panel collected by Rand Corporation can be employed to address problems like this. The analysis also will have practical utility, because it will shed light on why certain countries with high taxation levels, such as Scandinavian nations, can maintain high levels of tax compliance while other countries with lower taxation levels may have high levels of tax evasion as is the case in Greece and Italy. Project findings therefore should help nations like the United States reduce the occurrence of tax evasion.

&gt;Income tax evasion is a problem that poses considerable challenges for tax authorities and governments at the local, state, and federal levels. Its causes and implications are both economic and social. The role of tax evasion-related perceptions and how social networks influence those perceptions remain poorly understood, however. The investigators will build an agent-based computational simulation model of income tax evasion. Within the simulation, the compliance behavior of individuals will change through an adaptation process based on their past experiences with audits and tax evasion penalties, their perception of the fairness in taxation rates, and social interactions with people in their social networks. In conjunction, the investigators will conduct a national survey on the perceptions of tax fairness. The survey will gather individual-level data that will inform the simulation model's behavioral mechanisms. These mechanisms influence the propensity to evade, and the survey provides an empirical basis for choosing model-specific parameter values. Model assumptions will further be informed using sensitivity analyses. The simulation model will be validated and calibrated to reproduce U.S. national levels of income tax compliance for different tax brackets. In addition to the U.S., the model also will be calibrated using data sets and compliance levels for Greece and Denmark. Once calibrated, the model will be used to understand how tax evasion behaviors evolve differently depending on various starting assumptions, such as how social networks are structured or what fiscal policies are in place and the conditions for the system to produce tipping point dynamics. The model then will be used to identify fiscal policies that are most effective in minimize tax evasion and recovering compliance. The investigators will employ robust decision making, a method for improving policy decision making, to rank policies based both on their potential performance, as well as how robust this performance is to the key sources of uncertainty. This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.

But to voters on the fence, his manner came off as being rude and probably condescending.  A lot of snarky remarks and finger pointing won't be perceived positively (let alone directed at a woman) by objective undecided voters.

To me, last night Sanders won when he challenged Clinton to release the transcripts.  She was clearly evasive.  But his sarcastic remarks were a turn off.  Clinton won in portraying herself was someone who could get things done.  Two particular points she made were convincing: one is about the minimum wage (she would sign a $15 minimum wave if the bill was on her desk, but to get there, you couldn't do it in one step) and fracking (her explanation how foreign countries have go to through fracking first before getting to green energy was convincing).

On Israel and Palestinian, I found Sanders' statements very eloquent (he can't explain his position better than that).  Unfortunately, the entire tone came off as not being supportive of Israel as Clinton.  It would win the Palestinian vote in NY.  Unfortunately, there isn't any.

Overall, Sanders' supporters will vote for him. Clinton's supporters will vote for her.  For those people on the edge, I think Clinton did a little better.  I thought Clinton's closing remarks were very effective.  She was very appealing to NYers who voted her to the Senate.  She was asking them and talking to them directly.

Okay... well my bottom line took quite a hit since I got a mortgage 3 years ago, so why am I paying taxes? How do I go about incorporating my household?

I don't understand where these arbitrary differences and categories come from. I fully understand that much of that is simply my ignorance of the complicated laws and regulations that govern this stuff, but at the end of the day I'm not sure that can account for the grave injustice our tax system currently delivers to the average person in this country.

I'm sure there's some fancy-pants economists' answer as to why business need to be treated specially, but I'm not sure I care. ""Society needs these businesses to keep the economy alive."" Okay, and society needs middle class people to be able to afford to live too, so why do we see a higher value in the well-being of a corporation than we do in the well-being of a household? (Excepting the obvious increased impact of the failure of a corporation when compared to personal bankruptcy. My claim here is that what we have today is not valued proportionately.)

Businesses don't need help. They live and die by demand. If there is demand and they go bankrupt then they are mismanaging their business. Households need help, households need support. The demand for stable households is far more abstract than the instant gratification of being able to spend $10.00 on an App in Apple's store so they can take $3.33 of that, and so that the developer who actually made the fucking thing might get a penny. Millions (Billions?) of people wanted Apple to make an phone that integrated into all of Apple's other services. How many people asked me to start a family? How many would if we could actually appreciate the consequences of that choice; if it were as simple as the last line on the page being red or black?

I'm relatively well off. My combined household income is over 100k and we've got about 230k in debt (Mortgage and car) and I'm young-ish still, I think. My wife and are are happy because happy is relative, and a lot of people we know are still living with their parents, but every day my wife has to leave our daughter and go to work we feel like slaves to a system in which we have no stake or voice.

In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region “to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.” The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya’s ouster.""

"21500",1460739546,"I like how the main issue anyone has with Bernie is that he doesn't have a fully laid out plan on how to handle certain situations.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window.

Americans should have the right to vote in a fair process free of party corruptions, free of gerrymandering, and free of false choices between 'lesser of two evils'. How to accomplish that technically?

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.  
e.) All states should switch to vote by mail.
f.) Each ballot should have a durable carbon copy record for auditing purposes that shall remain legible at least 10 years in the humid Southeast.

&gt; As someone whose family members perished in the Holocaust, Sanders knows about the ongoing threats to the Jewish people, and our need to respond to those threats decisively. You may not agree with everything he says, but you can trust that when he says he is “committed not just to guaranteeing Israel’s survival, but also to its people’s right to live in peace and security,” he means it. All the presidential frontrunners declared their commitment to Israel, but only one has a true and honest relationship with the state. Given his record, his courage and his word, he deserves the support of the Jewish people.

&gt; The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also won’t explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

&gt; ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

&gt; ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

&gt; Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldn’t get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

"22336",1460736221,"May I ask what the actual justification of a $15 min. wage is? I don't mean whether we should raise the minimum wage, and I agree we should, but what rationale is being used to come up with a specific $15 target at the national level? Do those that support it actually know what the impact would be, or is the assumption simply that however many min. wage earners we have will be the same number who benefit from the min. wage increase? 

If your assumption is the latter, that every min. wage worker will benefit from an increase in the min. wage to $15, might I simply suggest you're making a rather strong assumption. And I don't even necessarily mean with respect to job losses, but with respect to job availability. Raising the min. wage will be no problem for the big boys. Your Wal-marts, Targets, Home Depots etc... will have no problem paying the higher min. wage. Aren't you at least a bit curious why Wal-mart has suddenly grown warm to the idea of an increase? Could it possibly have something to do with the fact that they now have so much market share that paltry increases in costs won't actually result in any decreases in profits, but will likely increase prices at Wal-mart, at least partially offsetting the assumed benefit flowing to min. wage workers after the increase (who shop at Wal-mart already). 

An increase in the minimum wage to $15 nationally would drill many small-to-medium businesses into the ground, after which we'll only have inefficient oligopolists to buy goods from, and then eventually only even more inefficient monopolists. If you care about consumers, then you should be advocating for policies that increase competition in markets. Now again, I support modest increases in the min. wage, handled at the city/state level, as these min. wages will better reflect the highly varied regional economic differences in the U.S. But, we should be wary of large bumps in the min. wage, because at the very least it puts small-to-medium businesses at an even larger cost disadvantage to large firms than they already have. Its very similar to how we handle environmental policy. By having across the board regulations, we put small businesses at a disadvantage by ignoring their cost disadvantage, with the end result being more market power driven to large firms.

We should advocate for policies that induce businesses to pay their low-income employees more while still having a min. wage set at some morally comfortable standard of living. But everything is a trade-off, not the least of which is the efficiency/equity trade off in our macroeconomy. So, while we may feel good about supporting a $15 min. wage because we believe it will benefit all min. wage workers, the outcome isn't at all so clear cut. Most research on min. wage shows that modest increases create modest but negligible job losses. This research doesn't come from right-wingers who hate the min. wage, but objective researchers seeking the TRUE impact of increasing the min. wage. Simply yelling that everyone who is concerned about a $15 min. wage is a corporate shill really just shows a naivete as to the fact that policy has consequences, many of them unintended. ","Reddit"

"22754",1460747256,"Well, let's see. She's been involved in some pretty interesting and often complicated issues of energy and environment in Alaska. She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

&gt;In each case the story runs into big trouble if you do a bit of homework; if not completely wrong, it needs a lot of qualification. But the all-purpose response to anyone who raises questions is that she or he is a member of the establishment, personally corrupt, etc.. Ad hominem attacks aren’t a final line of defense, they’re argument #1.

&gt;I know some people think that I’m obsessing over trivial policy details, but they’re missing the point. *It’s about an attitude, the sense that righteousness excuses you from the need for hard thinking and that any questioning of the righteous is treason to the cause.* **When you see Sanders supporters going over the top about “corporate whores” and such, you’re not seeing a mysterious intrusion of bad behavior into an idealistic movement; you’re seeing the intolerance that was always just under the surface of the movement, right from the start.**

I started out as neutral. I'm not American and I like to watch American politics from afar because I don't have to get emotionally invested and I don't have to eventually pick a side. But then the Sanders supporters got just so very toxic.

**Sanders supporters, you need to pay attention to this:** Your movement is toxic. You've taken it and tarnished it and smeared shit all over it. You've treated everyone who wasn't a True Believer in Bernie Sanders like a pariah, or like they're an evil paid corporate shill. You've acted like condescending assholes that nobody wants to associate with.

You will look back on this one day and you will cringe with embarrassment. You will get involved more deeply in politics one day and you will realize that your actions helped strangle Bernie Sanders's presidential bid in its cradle. You will look back at this and realize that you acted completely contrary to how people need to act in politics to win supporters.

It's sad this article is getting downvoted, because you need to read it. You guys need to know one of the reasons Bernie is losing and why he will never win.","Reddit"

If part of the effect is due to ""Women also tend to leave the workforce for periods to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay, and choose careers that tend to have lower pay."", then we need to look at a way to address this. 

When my child was born, I asked my boss if I could work part-time for six months to help my wife out. I wanted to work a ""90%"" schedule where I could take off every other Friday to give my wife a break (I had used up my vacation for parental leave). He looked at me like I had two heads and told me that the logistics of that were too hard to work out (the company is mid-sized, with over 500 employees). He would not let me do this even though I assured him that I could still do 100% of my duties in 90% of the time.

A number of women had part-time schedules in the company, but they were almost universally looked down upon. So there was not only a different standard in allowing part-time work (women could grudgingly get this, men could not), but there was a different opinion given when this was used.

Of course, the ""corporate"" message is ""yes, you should definitely be penalized, career-wise, if you choose to work less"". That is the assumption that needs to be challenged, because we are all humans, we have parents, we have children, and we wouldn't have much of a society if we make child-rearing a taboo corporate activity.","Reddit"

Did CNN ask why Hillary is fundraising in **China** and other countries?

&gt;The presidential campaign for Democrat Hillary Clinton is hosting a number of fundraisers overseas in the coming weeks, despite past issues with money from foreign donors.


&gt;This Friday, while her opponent Bernie Sanders is in the Vatican discussing global poverty with the presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador among others, ex-Goldman Sachs partner Gary Gensler will host a fundraiser for Clinton in Hong Kong.


&gt;That will follow his Wednesday event in Beijing, China looking for campaign cash.

Money as speech?  Okay, but that opens up a *lot* of side-door maneuvers to suppress both freedom of speech and of press.

 However think about it this way. Out of all the wealth the 8%  from your source holds, what percentage of that is controlled by the 60 wealthiest people on the planet? Most of it. Somebody who has 1 million dollars is in the 8%, along with people with 50 billion dollars. The top 60 are all billionaires.

Our youth are no longer satisfied with corrupt and broken politics and an economy of stark inequality and injustice. They are not satisfied with the destruction of our environment by a fossil fuel industry whose greed has put short term profits ahead of climate change and the future of our planet. They want to live in harmony with nature, not destroy it. They are calling out for a return to fairness; for an economy that defends the common good by ensuring that every person, rich or poor, has access to quality health care, nutrition and education.


As Pope Francis made powerfully clear last year in Laudato Si’, we have the technology and know-how to solve our problems – from poverty to climate change to health care to protection of biodiversity. We also have the vast wealth to do so, especially if the rich pay their way in fair taxes rather than hiding their funds in the world’s tax and secrecy havens- as the Panama Papers have shown.


The challenges facing our planet are not mainly technological or even financial, because as a world we are rich enough to increase our investments in skills, infrastructure, and technological know-how to meet our needs and to protect the planet. Our challenge is mostly a moral one, to redirect our efforts and vision to the common good. Centesimus Annus, which we celebrate and reflect on today, and Laudato Si’, are powerful, eloquent and hopeful messages of this possibility. It is up to us to learn from them, and to move boldly toward the common good in our time.""","Reddit"

She has the FBI investigation looming which is bad enough for an elected politician but for someone *running* it's incredibly precarious. Whether she's guilty of anything or not, the FBI will interview her and try to catch her perjuring herself, which is very often how these things go.

Then we have these transcripts. Which is an impossible spot for her, there's bound to be something in them that is detrimental to her campaign. She can't clean them up and release them because that could cause someone else to come forward to contradict the content with video or something. Not to mention any day they could be leaked (and likely will be). 

Say what you will about Bernie but he is giving her a run for her money and really making her look bad in the primaries. He's a tough opponent to attack without making her look conservative. She's having to move a lot farther to the left than she probably wanted to (TPP, breaking up banks, more explicit rhetoric on income inequality, campaign finance reform, etc.) which will make it harder for her to move back to the center in the general and may come back to haunt her in office.

Where her argument falls short is that Bernie Sanders has run his entire campaign without Super-PACS at all.

&gt; CLINTON: You know, let me tell you why. You may not like the answer, but I’ll tell you why. President *Obama* had a super PAC when he ran. President *Obama* took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. And President *Obama* was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...

"28723",1460764348,"So a lot of people here are raising the good point of how since adopting capitalism the world has lifted many out of poverty and we've seen vast technological developments. As you praise capitalism, I encourage you to also take a step back. Look at the larger picture and in a more a abstract sense, try and dissect what capitalism is and why it's been successful. It's not that capitalism is some magic wand, it's a system that has underlying mechanisms which have brought us this growth. Ask yourself what those mechanisms are, and how we can strengthen those mechanisms. At the same time, look at the problems it has been unable to solve, and how we can fix that. Because while we've seen great growth, you can't deny the crummy materialistic consumer culture it promotes through constant manipulative advertisements to sell us products we don't actually need, and the amount of environmental damage we've caused for the sake of cost savings and convenience.

To me, what I believe has made capitalism successful is that it distributed power. It gave people much more control over their lives and their communities, where previously the decision making had come from the top down and people had mostly pre defined roles. It was too rigid. The people making the decisions were too far removed to even know what was going on or how their decisions affected the people, and obviously those making the decisions have their own interests held above others. Capitalism smashed this idea at first, but it hasn't solved it. Time and time again, our economic power gets concentrated again in the hands of the few, and the engine stalls.","Reddit"

&gt;Ever since Manuel Zelaya was removed from the Honduran presidency by that country's Supreme Court and Congress on June 28 for violations of the constitution, the Obama administration has insisted, without any legal basis, that the incident amounts to a ""coup d'état"" and must be reversed....""The administration is standing by its ""coup"" charge and 10 days ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went so far as to sanction the country's independent judiciary. The U.S. won't say why, but its clear the court's sin is rejecting a U.S.-backed proposal to restore Mr. Zelaya to power....""Since June 28, the U.S. has been pressuring Honduras to put Mr. Zelaya back in the presidency. But neither Mrs. Clinton's spurious ""rule of law"" claims or the tire iron handed her by Mr. Obama to use against this little country have been effective in convincing the Honduran judiciary that it ought to abandon its constitution.""

Then, apparently the idea that the removal of Zelaya from office (though not his exile from the country, and perhaps not the way it was done) was legal and constitutional has a lot of support. (So does the idea that it wasn't, of course.) Here are some examinations of it, pro and con: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27état#Legality_of_ouster), [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2009/0721/p09s02-wogn.html), [CNN](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-295913).

That last is by Miguel Estrada, whom some of you may remember as a George Bush nominee to the US Court of Appeals who was rejected for being a conservative ideologue. So take it with however much salt you need. He is Honduran himself, though, and that article offers the most detailed account of Zelaya's actions that allegedly led to his ouster.","Reddit"

Why is it seen as a negative that Bernie Sanders couldn't specify differences between his and Trump's stance on NATO? If anything, to me, it shows that this is one issue that both parties can agree to cooperate and actually do something about since their beliefs are similar on this topic.

I personally don't think that because Bernie Sanders agrees with one side of the republican policies, that democrats should see that as a negative. To me, thats a positive.

"29223",1460751991,"﻿ I have disagreed with Paul Krugman's blogs about Bernie Sanders--his faulty analysis of the Daily News interview, and his sneering depiction of Sanders at every turn as in ""the revolutionary isn't cute any more."" His inability to say anything positive about the man, such as his passion, vision, his consistency, his strength in Congress sponsoring and co-sponsoring bills (across the aisle and with Sec. Clinton), his resonance with many, many voters, any of his policies. This indicates to me not reasoned, authentic political thinking, but a smear campaign. But today Paul Krugman and I agree on something. I found it deeply disturbing that in the Brooklyn debate last night that Sanders reiterated his remark that he lost the South because it's conservative. He lost among African American voters. His remark effectively dismisses them as conservatives, and that's a problem. I don't think the remark accurately reflects his positions and actions concerning systemic racism in this country. But he should hear the problem in his remark and stop saying it, and say why he was wrong to say it. I have been pondering why many African Americans in the Southern primaries (including in my small Virginian town) voted for Clinton. Of course, there are multiple reasons and points of view. But I don't think it has been conservativism. And I don't think it's necessarily affection for the Clintons. People I know said, ""She's electable."" I think African American voters deeply understand the gravity of the situation, more than most white voters probably. A white friend in a predominantly Black union in Philadelphia said that when she asked the question, people said, ""Bernie who?"" The longer the campaign goes on, the more people will be able to answer that question. But Bernie Sanders needs to understand what's wrong with calling a predominantly African American vote (in my town almost all Democrats are Black and almost all Republicans are white) ""conservative.""

"29237",1460757286,"&gt;Hillary’s own director of policy planning, Anne-Marie Slaughter urged her to “find that [the] coup was a ‘military coup’ under U.S. law and revoke the visas of more de facto regime members...high level people from both the business and the NGO community say that even our friends are beginning to think we are not really committed to the norm of constitutional democracy.”

It's so hard to tell what's really going on at a geopolitical level, but Hillary's legitimization of the new Honduran regime just seems super suspect to me.

Many other countries refused to recognize the post-coup government and refused, in protest, to observe the quick fix ""free election"" Hillary negotiated.  

Our allies wanted nothing to do with the election, because it was a sham - 

&gt;While observers were touched by the commitment, courage and enthusiasm of the many Hondurans who participated in this process in good faith, they were also saddened by the numerous discrepancies, lack of preparedness and resources, bribery, voter intimidation, violence and fraud that they witnessed. According to Dale Sorenson of the Task Force on the Americas, the observations documented in the delegation report “demonstrate a clear pattern of systematic undermining of the Honduran people’s right to a free and fair election.”  http://afgj.org/honduras-election-monitoring-report

and

&gt;""On election day, November 29, there were a number of incidents that confirmed the climate of repression in which the electoral process took place, which represented the consolidation of the coup d'etat of June 28th."" Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL)

And, seems the coup was successful - http://fpif.org/anatomy-election-fraud-stealing-2013-honduran-election-five-simple-steps/

EDIT:  Now I think about it, there are only 2 possibilities

1) HC had some conflict of interest to support the coup leaders. I can't begin to guess what but I guess Obama did too, since ultimately it was his call.  

2) HC was naive enough to think the leaders of a coup would be sure to run a free and fair election.  Or, let's say it wasn't a coup, she was naive enough to think the kind of people who would issue a secret warrant, arrest the elected President in the middle of the night in his pajamas and extradite him in violation of their own constitution would be sure to run a free and fair elections.

"29240",1460770154,"This is a repost about the US involvement in regime change in Honduras -   
  
&gt;Dude, it's Honduras. They have by far the highest homicide rate out of any country in the world. More than half as many people are murdered there per year than in the United States, even though their population is only 8.5 million. Their GDP per capita is about $2400 per year, making them one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere.  
  

&gt;Honduras wasn't going to turn into a utopia if the US government cut off much needed aid, which was not required by law, because it was not a military coup, and normal constitutional and electoral function resumed very quickly afterwards. The supreme court was legally entitled to order the president out of office.
  
  
&gt;The real goal in a situation like that is to avoid a civil war, which was a very real possibility. And if the US had taken a strong stance against the new government, and war broke out, they would have been obligated to intervene. That point cannot be stressed enough.
  
  
&gt;To drive that point home, I will give you an example of how you can really fuck that kind of thing up.
  
  
&gt;At the end of the Gulf War in 1991, anybody that had anything to do with the military or foreign relations in the US government was badly in need of a vacation. Thousands people who normally work 40 hours a week had been working 70 hours a week for six months, and more than half a million US military personnel had been in full war mode for even longer.
  
  
&gt;Time to take a breather, right?
  
  
&gt;Wrong. Really wrong.
  
  
&gt;At that exact point in history, the USSR was collapsing. So no time off for anyone.
And in that context, the US made some rather subtle mistakes in their messaging, which is understandable. Unfortunately, as a result, the Iraqi Kurds got the impression that the US would support them of they rose up against Saddam.   
  
  
&gt;But the coalition had avoided invading Iraq precisely because they had achieved their objectives, and didn't want to get caught up in Iraq's ethnic squabbles.
  
  
&gt;The Kurdish uprising was subsequently brutally crushed.
  
  
&gt;It was a lesson for future US administrations. If you give even tacit support for a resistance movement, they might expect you to help them.
  
  
&gt;So when Honduras happened, they kept their mouths shut, and maintained the status quo.
Since you are clearly passionate about this (which I appreciate) I would ask you what you would have done if you were the president of the US when that happened.
  
  
&gt;Keep in mind that at that exact moment, the following things were demanding attention and resources from the Whitehouse:
  
  
&gt;-There were 135,000 troops in Iraq. There were also 50,000 in Afghanistan, where the violence was spiralling out of control.
  
  
&gt;-The global financial crisis was still a huge issue, and the US economy was struggling badly. People were abandoning their homes in large numbers, and tent cities were becoming a common sight in major cities.
    
  
&gt;-The ACA battle, which was to be Obama's signature legislative achievement as President, was in a critical stage.
  
  
&gt;-The Tea Party movement had picked up real steam. People were bringing assault rifles to protests, and talking openly about overthrowing the government by force.
  
  
&gt;-The new H1N1 virus was spreading rapidly in the US. By the end of the year, it would kill more than 3,000 Americans, and put more than 25,000 in hospital, making it more substantial in terms of human damage than either Pearl Harbour or September 11th. ","Reddit"

&gt;Clinton’s admission to Kandil was first produced to the Select Committee on Benghazi on October 13, 2015 and publicized on the day of Mrs. Clinton’s testimony, October 22, but court filings in Judicial Watch litigation show that the record was only produced after two federal court judges ordered the State Department to produce more Benghazi-related records to Judicial Watch.  Similarly, Judicial Watch litigation also forced the release of the September 11, 2012 email in which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed her daughter by email that the attack had been staged by an “Al Qaeda-like group,” rather than as the result of “inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” as Mrs. Clinton had claimed in her official public statement one hour earlier.","Reddit"

Well for one it puts the lie to her claims that Benghazi was touched off by the video, which is what she and her envoys preached for weeks afterward, including to the families of the dead.

At 10:08 p.m. on September 11, Mrs. Clinton issued an official State Department press statement, approved by the White House, placing the blame for the attack on an Internet video:

...

Yet the next day, in her 7:49 PM September 12 conversation with 
Kandil, Clinton said, “We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do 
with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest.” Kandil 
responded, “You’re not kidding. Based on the information we saw today we
believe that group that claimed responsibility for this is affiliated 
with al-Qaeda.”

So by the very next evening she was talking to world leaders and telling them they knew it wasn't about a video. It was terrorism, straight up. But they changed the talking points to hide the terrorism angle because it was an election year and Obama had been running on the platform that al Qaeda and other terror orgs were ""on the run.""

It was a baldfaced lie told to the American people, and it was told so Obama could retain the White House and Hillary could still pretend that Libya was a feather in her cap for 2016, instead of a miserable failure.","Reddit"

It is Democrats who refuse to simplify the tax code while bitching and moaning that corporations pay no taxes... they need the wedge issue to whip the rank and file left in an outraged lather...

"31672",1460760542,"&gt;Given the United States’ history of disenfranchising black voters — not to mention the importance of black voters to Democrats in November — it’s dicey for Sanders to diminish Clinton’s wins there.

It really boggles my mind that Sanders hasn't realized this by now. Doesn't he have advisors? ","Reddit"
"31673",1460760408,"&gt; But overall, the math is pretty simple. Sanders is winning states that are much whiter than the Democratic electorate as a whole, Clinton is winning states that are much blacker than the Democratic electorate as a whole and Clinton is winning most of those states that are somewhere in the middle, whether they’re in the South (like Virginia) or elsewhere (like Ohio or Nevada). That’s why she’ll probably be the Democratic nominee.

The US economy is being deflated, one sector at a time, and has been for a good 20 years if not more. The cost of clothing has probably gone down the most because the labor is now in Malaysian sweat shops. Food is somewhat cheaper because of huge agri-business and the fact that a lot of food is sourced from overseas. Housing hasn't gone down that much, though illegal immigrants working in the building trade have had a small impact.

Things like toys, books, electronics, cars, and most of the rest of our consumer economy have gone down (or at least haven't risen as much as inflation) due to these global pressures. I remember in 1990 when a VCR (made in Japan) cost $500 - now you can get something similar (DVD recorder) for $200, which is like $100 in 1990 dollars.

The cost of government, however, has not gone down, because there is no global pressure. So as people in many different industries have lost their jobs to overseas pressures and have had to find work for less money, government workers have not.

I'm not saying this to make the case that we should pay government workers less - I don't think that at all. I'm pointing out, however, how the dismantling of our economy directly impacts this issue. ","Reddit"

The U.S. Constitution says nothing about political parties, which are private enterprises able to set their own rules.

Continuing:

&gt;Voters may feel disenfranchised, disgusted and downright angry because of Citizens United. But it's not like the masses would rise up in revolution and overthrow the government because of Citizens United. Revolutions happen in history books and in other parts of the world, not in modern-day America because of Citizens United.

The thing is corporations that expect to do business publicly have to conform to the laws of the land they wish to do business in.  If that land has laws protecting people from discrimination, and your corporation wants to discriminate, they are breaking the law and should face legal action.

Sure, the corporation can bitch and moan about how they hate this group or that group all they want.  Now that is free speach.  But as soon as they start refusing to serve those people based on the ignorance the speak about, the the corporation is discriminating and breaking the fucking laws.

Adam Lanza is the one to blame here, but he killed himself to prevent being held responsible for his actions. It could be argued that his mother was to blame for not locking the weapons away to prevent her mentally unstable son from reaching them, but she also paid the ultimate price for not doing so.

After this tragedy, there was legislation introduced to reinstate the Assault weapons ban, Sanders voted Yes. Had he not voted yes then I could understand some resentment and an apology.

You want to know who is that person? 

The maniac who shot your kid. And he's dead. 

Maybe we do need tighter gun control, background checks, access to mental healthcare, yadda yadda yadda. I understand that. But you can't just ignore the constitution and ignore the needs of people in rural states. Bernie Sanders is a senator for Vermont. When he voted against that bill he was representing the people of Vermont. Should they all apologize also? Should the governor of Vermont apologize? 

Where does this end? 

Bernie Sanders has a fucking D from the NRA. He's tougher on gun control then pretty much every republican running right now. Even many democrats. 

But that's not even the main thing that pisses me off about this, what really pisses me off is Clinton using dead children to attack Sanders. 

Fuck her. What happened in Sandy Hook happened for a lot of reasons. But you want to know perhaps the major reason? The dehumanization and personal alienation caused by neoliberalism and consumer culture. Two things people like Clinton are highly in favor of. Should she apologize too?

Or are we still doing this thing where we pretend that guy somehow came out of a vacuum? He called into a radio show once and compared himself to Travis the chimp (chimp who mauled his friend's owner). Namely like somebody being forced to live an unnatural and absurd existence in a society that doesn't care about them. 

Maybe I'm wrong for treating Adam Lanza like a human being, but why the fuck is that aspect, something that crops up whenever these kinds of shootings happen, never talked about? 

 I don't bring that up to attack Clinton but to pinpoint the hypocrisy of this entire argument. The shallowness and stupidity of it. What happened in Sandy Hook was everyone's fault, it was our whole culture's fault.

You really want to stop this shit? Look inwards. Don't get pissed at Bernie Sanders for doing his fucking job.

Even today both of Virginia's senators are Democrats while New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and Colorado have 1 Republican and 1 Democrat as senators. Sanders is writing off a major chunk of the Democratic party which is bad politics (duh) and also makes it harder for Democrats to do well in those areas in the future. Unfortunately for Sanders the race isn't entirely out of the South yet. Maryland and Kentucky were below the mason-dixon line and they still have yet to vote, I would be surprised if he won either.

Furthermore,  Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, Alaska, etc. are all darker red than the ""Deep South"" states Bernie is trying to dismiss.

"35688",1460818166,"I've commented similar things in a couple threads already, but I feel like this is a message worth spreading. 

We all have a choice, reacting to this news. We could take partisan sides, argue about the details of the trip or discuss whether it was a political ploy. Or we could talk about compassion, discuss how to work together, possibly even make amends across candidate preferences and party lines. 

When someone like the Pope tries to spread peace and compassion throughout the world he gives us an opportunity to follow his lead. He gives us a chance to look away from politics and to look inside ourselves to see what is truly good there. He gives us a chance to rise above heated policy discussions and recognize that in the end we're all in this together. 

Whether or not we agree on policy is one thing, but the more important question is whether we agree on a common goal. Do we agree that we're all in this together, that we're all living on the same Earth, that we're all intrinsically connected? Do we agree that the way to govern is to choose what is right for all of us, not just the few? Do we agree that ethics has a place in politics? Do we agree that people should have shelter and security and that we should work to provide it for the weak and infirm? Do we agree that we should work to benefit the community and not ourselves?

These are important questions that too often get lost in the intricacies of politics. I hope we all agree on the answers, but that's not the point. Just being reminded that the questions exist is enough to change the way we act. Working as individuals isn't how we improve society, but working together is. Reminding ourselves that we have a shared responsibility to take care of each other and the planet is beyond any parties or candidates, it's intrinsic to human life itself. Again -- we're all in this together. You and me, I and them, them and you. We're all one.

"35813",1460822827,"The 1994 crime bill did not cause mass incarceration.  In fact, there's little evidence that it was even a major contributor to mass incarceration.

Here's the [total US prison population by year](http://i.imgur.com/BCNb3rT.jpg).  See if you can spot 1994.  

And here's the [change in the US prison population per year](http://i.imgur.com/C3SV0Yy.jpg).  Note that the rate of increase began declining right after the 1994 crime bill was enacted.

All data from John Pfaff, a Fordham law school professor and expert on mass incarceration.  Here's what Pfaff wrote in the NYT this week:

[Bill Clinton Is Wrong About His Crime Bill. So Are the Protesters He Lectured](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/magazine/bill-clinton-is-wrong-about-his-crime-bill-so-are-the-protesters-he-lectured.html?_r=0)

&gt; We know the act didn’t cause mass incarceration: Prison populations started rising around 1974, and by 1994 they had roughly tripled, from 300,000 to over one million. It’s almost surely the case that America was the world’s largest jailer well before the act was passed. So if the act didn’t cause mass incarceration, the question becomes: Did it help continue to drive it? The answer, by and large, is no.
&gt; 
&gt; For one thing, most of the act’s provisions applied only to federal crimes. The tough new anti-gang laws, the expanded death-penalty provisions, the three-strikes laws: All applied only to those tried in federal court. And those, over all, are fairly minor players, with the federal prison system holding about only 13 percent of all prisoners. The other 87 percent of inmates are in state systems — and none of the act’s new criminal laws affected what happened in state systems.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, there were some provisions of the act aimed at influencing state law. The most important was the Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing (VOI/TIS) Incentive Grant Program, which set aside about $10 billion to encourage states to make parole much rarer for people convicted of violent crimes, through what are called “truth in sentencing” laws. The grants even included funds for building out prison capacity, to deal with any resulting rise in inmate populations. If there was any part of the 1994 act that should have driven incarceration, it was this one.
&gt; 
&gt; And yet it didn’t. In a General Accounting Office study, only four states said the grants strongly influenced their decisions to adopt TIS laws. One of those four, New York, received more grant money than any other state, and its prison populations began a 15-year decline before the six-year program was even over. Almost half of the 27 states with TIS laws said the grants were irrelevant, and 23 states opted not to adopt the laws at all. All told, about 70 to 80 percent of all prisoners were held in states where the grants made no real impact. And there’s no evidence that prison populations grew any faster in states with TIS laws than in states without them.","Reddit"

1st video segment:
CBS News anchor man explains a bit about what Bernie is going to talk about and how his values in a moral economy align with the Pope's, then the co-anchor lady finishes off the segment with ""It's important to note that the likelihood of him meeting with the Pope Francis is pretty low- in fact, he's probably not going to meet with Pope Francis and to sort of clarify too, he wasn't invited to the Vatican by the Pope but he was invited by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences- typically the Vatican does not light into issues related to politics though we have seen this Pope, ah, dabble here and there with some comments he's made along the way.""

2rd video segment:
Two CBS anchors offscreen discussing Bernie's trip. The first says that the Vatican says Pope Francis has no plans to meet with Sanders, the the second mentions how some are saying that Sanders lobbied to get the invite but that his campaign says the trip is not political. Meanwhile, the giant ticker running across the bottom of the video states ""CANDIDATE NOT LIKELY TO MEET POPE FRANCIS"".

3rd segment:
At the end if the video, CBS anchorman (live from Rome) Seth Dohn (sic) gives some obvious attitude as he says ""The Vatican has distanced itself from this invitation and has told us the Pope will not meet Senator Sanders. This trip was being billed as being above politics, Scott, but rather it seems to be all about politics.""

"35830",1460799001,"So, at the end of the day does this really surprise anyone?

This whole thing was so weird to watch unfold.

And now here we are, he was invited, he did speak and he did meet the Pope. Did anybody actually believe Sanders was lying?

Edit: Aaaand a quick glance at /r/HRC lets the spiel continue!

* The meeting probably never happened, reports are fake!

* If it did happen, it was a pity meeting!

* Maybe it happened, but meeting the Pope was definitely not worth leaving NY for! ^(also Sanders is a fraud for spending the money of poor college students on his family vacation)

* Meeting the Pope was the lowest move of his campaign so far!

&gt;In the Reality Check, Mehdi Hasan challenges Israel's narrative, arguing the country still controls Gaza's borders, airspace and territorial waters. He also points to the fact Israel controls the population register, meaning the government defines who is and who is not a resident of Gaza.  


First off, what is a blockade?

&gt;A blockade is an effort to cut off supplies, war material or communications from a particular area by force, either in part or totally. A blockade should not be confused with an embargo or sanctions, which are legal barriers to trade. It is also distinct from a siege in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region, rather than a fortress or city. While most blockades historically took place at sea, blockade is still used on land to prevent someone coming into a certain area.

So a blockade is  defined as blocking of land borders and sea borders. An important thing that should be noted is that Egypt also borders Gaza. Egypt has also blockaded a part of the land border of Gaza. Is Egypt now an occupation force in Gaza?

Another thing that needs to be pointed out is medium of blockade. Historically, blockades at sea and land have only existed because those were the only types of travel. With the invention of air travel, it makes sense that a new form of blockade, as in blockade by the air, would be not allowing planes to fly into Gaza. So an air blockade is no different from a land or sea blockade, it is prevention of goods or things into a territory, except by air.


Blockade is not occupation, and having multiple mediums of blockade doesnt mean one is occupying a country.

"35856",1460813399,"The other part mentioned is the Population Registry.

&gt;Civil registration is the system by which a government records the vital events of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database is called civil register, and the office responsible for receiving registrations is often called the registrar, registry, or population registry. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal document that can be used to establish and protect the rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was Sweden in 1631, which was organized by the Church of Sweden but on the demand of The Crown.
The United Nations defines civil registration as ""the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population as provided through decree or regulation in accordance with the legal requirements of a country. Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents provided by the law. These records are also a main source of vital statistics. Complete coverage, accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential for quality vital statistics.""[1]


So having a count of the population of the Gaza strip is now occupation?

"35873",1460833816,"Despite the flood of pro-Israel accounts in this thread, this article is 100% right that Israel is still illegally occupied.

&gt; ﻿ Israel argues that its occupation of the Gaza Strip ended with the unilateral withdrawal of its settler population in 2005. It then declared the Gaza Strip to be “hostile territory” and declared war against its population. Neither the argument nor the statement is tenable. **Despite removing 8,000 settlers and the military infrastructure that protected their illegal presence, Israel maintained effective control of the Gaza Strip and thus remains the occupying power as defined by Article 47 of the Hague Regulations.** To date, Israel maintains control of the territory’s air space, territorial waters, electromagnetic sphere, population registry and the movement of all goods and people.

Furthermore, the occupation is a collective punishment of the Palestinian people:

&gt; In early 2006 (after Hamas won elections), Dov Weisglass, then a senior advisor to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, explained that **Israel’s policy towards Gaza was designed “to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.”** In September 2007, Olmert’s government further tightened restrictions Gaza and prohibited the export of all goods.

&gt; In 2012, following a protracted legal battle waged by Israeli human rights group Gisha, the Israeli government released a confidential document produced in 2008 detailing how **Israeli officials had been calculating the minimum caloric intake needed to keep Gazans from starving while maintaining strict control over the import of food.**

If Israel is so reasonable with respect to Gaza, then why does every major human rights group consider the blockade collective punishment that flagrantly violates international law?

&gt; A 2009 Amnesty International report following Operation Cast Lead, Israel’s devastating military assault on Gaza in the winter of 2008-9, stated: 

&gt; **The prolonged blockade of Gaza, which had already been in place for some 18 months before the current fighting began, amounts to collective punishment of its entire population.**

&gt; The Fourth Geneva Convention specifically prohibits collective punishment. Its Article 33 provides: ‘No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.’

According to the International Committee of the Red Cross in a June 2010 statement:

&gt; The whole of Gaza's civilian population is being punished for acts for which they bear no responsibility. **The closure therefore constitutes a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law.**

In September 2010, a UN fact-finding mission into Israel's attack on the flotilla, which tried to deliver critically-needed medical supplies to Gaza, concluded:

&gt; The Mission considers that one of the principal motives behind the imposition of the blockade was a desire to punish the people of the Gaza Strip for having elected Hamas. **The combination of this motive and the effect of the restrictions on the Gaza Strip leave no doubt that Israel’s actions and policies amount to collective punishment as defined by international law.** In this connection, the Mission supports the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, Richard Falk, the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict and most recently the ICRC that **the blockade amounts to collective punishment in violation of Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law**.

So you can whitewash the blockade all you want, but please understand that the human rights consensus is not on your side. Frankly, it is part of a brutal, oppressive occupation that deprives Gazans of control their own lives.","Reddit"

You are greeting a Presidential candidate, you are sending a political message.  And in this regards, the Pope is really bold in doing this.

* Both want to make college either free or very affordable and with super low loan rates forever,

* Both support women's rights and will fund access to planned parenthood.  Trump's daughters praise him as helping to shape them into kind and competent women who know they can achieve anything (don't believe the media's lies about Trump on race and women). 
* Both grew up in the Brooklyn/Queens New York area and support equal opportunity for all races and are very multicultural given their New York upbringing. (again don't believe the media's lies about Trump as he employs more minorities than anyone and values hard work and opportunity.)
* Trump will eliminate the hedge fund tax loophole that lets billionaires like Romney and Warren Buffet pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries.  Bernie will prefer to go even farther against wallstreet and big banks.
* Both are Washington and party outsiders.

* Both want to renegotiate all the terrible trade deals so America doesn't get ripped off anymore.  
* Both want to tax companies that move workers abroad and create more jobs and industry right here in America.
* Both want to repeal citizen's united and remove the corrupt superpac money from politics.

She's got more negative coverage from the liberal media than Sanders does.","Reddit"
"36022",1460830371,"I disagree with you on multiple fronts about the articles

[First article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-zelizer/index.html) You say CNN ""unabashedly proclaiming Hillary as the clear winner."" What I see is an **opinion** piece  saying that both candidates did well in certain areas but the author thinks Hillary did better at specific policy attacks on Sanders. Not exactly a crazy statement.

[Second article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/clinton-and-sanders-supporters-animosity-opinion-zelizer/index.html) Again an opinion piece, but I think has a lot of merit to it. This is not saying vote for Clinton, its saying that if Sanders wins current climate could turn Clinton voters away from voting for him. I know a lot of people that don't like Sanders, not because they don't like him, but they hate his supporters. They think that Sanders supporters just spam their Facebook walls and insist they just haven't seen the light.

[Third Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/16/politics/bernie-sanders-israel-democratic-politics/index.html) If anything this article praises Sanders for a stance many people have been wanting to make but don't have the balls too. It also brings up the chance that it could backfire if the sentiment isn't taken as positively as he would like. Sounds like an average article to me

[Fourth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/opinions/clinton-sanders-views-israel-miller/index.html) Again, an opinion piece. Similarly to the last one its saying to Sanders has taken a very bold and potentially stance on Israel versus Clinton who has taken a very safe stance. Maybe you can call foul at the ""Donald Obama"" part, which I will admit just sounds a bit weird.

[Fifth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/politics/bernie-sanders-jane-sanders-taxes/index.html) Begrudgingly? Is CNN supposed to throw a party because he did released his taxes and unsurprisingly there was nothing interesting in them?

[Sixth Article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/14/politics/bernie-sanders-religion/index.html) I'm not gonna argue in support of this one too much. I see this one as pandering to your readers, Salon will write articles all day and night asking the question ""Did Hillary flip flop on her stance for Nazi Moon camps"" or something equally ridiculous because certain people eat it up. Its no surprise that CNN does it too.

I feel like a lot of this is just manufactured outrage to maintain the status of the oppressed grass roots little guy, the beacon of light in a dark harbor. Sanders has been doing well the last month or so, and the lack of gains since the wins were in small states can be disappointing. However, it doesnt necessarily mean that there is some sort of massive conspiracy against Sanders. CNN wants a close race, that would make them a lot more money. 
   ","Reddit"
"36023",1460828576,"It is unprecedented to ask a presidential candidate to release the transcripts from private speeches. 

It is the expectation that a presidential candidate will release substantial tax returns. 

Sanders still has not done so - there have been accusations of impropriety surrounding his finances, especially as they relate to his family and wife. 

He's hiding something. It's not hard to release old tax returns. I could do it very quickly, and I am pretty bad at adulting. 

Sanders must either be hiding something, or an incompetent adult. 

Mentioning Obama repeatedly is not something that should be counted against Clinton - Sanders is running on the premise that Obama wasn't a good president. Clinton is running on the premise that he did a good job, especially considering the circumstances. 

Selling herself as 'Obama's third term' is reasonable, both as being the truth and as a political move.  

Trudeau is a prime minister, not a president. He wasn't directly elected by the people. He's part of a parliamentary government. 

Apples and oranges are not the same. 

Also, 80 percent of millenials don't agree with you - maybe 80 percent of millenials on reddit or twitter, but that's not as many of you as you think. 

Polls show that Sanders supporters say they are going to vote for Clinton at the same (or even higher) rate as Clinton supporters said in 2008. 

Also, the idea that the media are in the tank for Hillary is laughable, unless you're blinded by confirmation bias. Studies show that she gets more negative media than any other candidate.

Are we to be known as the ones who started a new order? An order based on truth and togetherness and respect for all people? An order where wall-street criminals are punished? An order where smoking a plant that makes you giggle doesn't put you in prison?

People in America and Europe cannot understand living with a neighbor who is dedicated to your destruction.  Yes, you too are committing atrocities, but it is to protect your people.  If America restrains the Isrealis, the Palestinians and the Arab world aren't going to reciprocate with restraint.  That's not how this works.  The presence of other Western Powers is the only thing keeping the Palestinians alive, Isreal would have wiped all of them out long ago without western pressure.  

People who say that shouldn't have to choose between the lesser of two evils don't understand reality.  In general, picking between two evils is all anyone ever does.  I voted twice for Obama, but Obama has done a lot of stuff in office that I am vehemently opposed to.  That doesn't mean I regret voting for him.  He's done a lot of bad stuff, but, on balance, I feel he's a better chief executive than Romney or McCain would be, so I went with him for my vote.  Lesser of two evils, because I have to vote for someone, and no one I could vote for is completely in line with my views.  

Bottom Line: the reality, on the ground, is different than what you get from a western perch through the media.  On the ground, what you do to protect your own is different than what you say you would do when you don't have to confront the daily realities.  ","Reddit"

"36331",1460798982,"&gt; The Vatican is loathe to get involved in electoral campaigns, and usually tries to avoid any perception of partisanship as far as the pope is concerned. Popes rarely travel to countries during the thick of political campaigns, knowing a papal photo op with the sitting head of state can be exploited for political ends.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Francis has been known to flout Vatican protocol, and the meeting with Sanders is evidence that his personal desires often trump Vatican diplomacy.

&gt; The invitation to Sanders to address the Vatican conference raised eyebrows when it was announced last week and touched off allegations that the senator lobbied for the invitation.
&gt; 
&gt; But the chancellor for the pontifical academy, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, said **he invited Sanders because he was the only U.S. presidential candidate who showed deep interest in the teachings of Francis**.

"36574",1460826372,"&gt;Seven years earlier, on 16 January 1998, Lewinsky’s friend – an older work colleague called Linda Tripp – invited her for lunch at a mall in Washington DC. Lewinsky was 25. They’d been working together at the Pentagon for nearly two years, during which time Lewinsky had confided in her that she’d had an affair with President Bill Clinton. Unbeknown to Lewinsky, Tripp had been secretly recording their telephone conversations – more than 20 hours of them. The lunch was a trap. When Tripp arrived, she motioned behind her and two federal agents suddenly appeared. “You’re in trouble,” they told Lewinsky.

&gt;She was bustled upstairs to a hotel room filled with prosecutors and federal agents. She started to cry. They told her they were investigating claims that President Clinton had sexually harassed a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Jones, and that if Lewinsky didn’t cooperate with them she’d be charged with perjury and jailed for 27 years.

That seems pretty messed up.  So two people engage in a sexual act and one seems to get thrown under the bus?  I think Bill Clinton gets some razzing, but it's crazy how difficult people made her life for something that wasn't just her decision-making.  ","Reddit"

"36595",1460829848,"&gt; Hillary Clinton recently blasted the hidden financial dealings exposed in the Panama Papers, but she and her husband have multiple connections with people who have used the besieged law firm Mossack Fonseca to establish offshore entities.

&gt; Among them are Gabrielle Fialkoff, finance director for Hillary Clinton’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate; Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining magnate who has traveled the globe with Bill Clinton; the Chagoury family, which pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative; and Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng, who was at the center of a Democratic fund-raising scandal when Bill Clinton was president. Also using the Panamanian law firm was the company founded by the late billionaire investor Marc Rich, an international fugitive when Bill Clinton pardoned him in the final hours of his presidency.

These aren't just meaningless connections by any stretch.

Edit: Sanders' points with respect to Clinton's judgement are likely further validated by this

&gt; Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York, said it would draw voters’ attention once again to Clinton’s ties to big money. “It certainly would play into Sanders’ narrative,” he said.

&gt; Sanders said Clinton’s support of a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Panama – one that he claims has allowed the wealthy to avoid paying taxes – should disqualify her from being the Democratic nominee for president.

&gt; “I don’t think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement, something I very strongly opposed, which has made it easier for wealthy people and corporations all over the world to avoid paying taxes owed to their countries,” Sanders said recently.","Reddit"

Though, as an aside, it is amazingly funny that Bernie supporters both want to have their cake (polls are unreliable even weeks before the primaries) and eat it too (polls of the general election eight months in advance are indicative of who is stronger).

I'm not secretly uber-liberal and supporting Clinton only because I'm not sure Bernie could win.  I'm supporting Clinton because I don't want Bernie to be my nominee.  I would rather lose with a candidate I believe in than win with a candidate who is almost as anathema to my views as Kasich (Trump is worse, don't get me wrong).

Every wealthy person in Saudi Arabia is a ""Saudi Prince"" in the Saudi ""Royal Family"".  There are [FIFTEEN THOUSAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud) of them.  It's their government service title.

&gt;The family is estimated to be composed of 15,000 members, but the majority of the power and wealth is possessed by a group of only about 2,000.

And many of those have donated to terrorists or sent money to their wayward children who are terrorists, etc.  Just as many Americans have.  Ahem.

But that doesn't make Saudi Arabia, as a sovereign nation, a supporter of 9/11 as a matter of national policy.

The best analogy would be to claim that the US government was behind the bombing of the Oklahoma Federal Building because Timothy McVeigh's dad sent him money for Christmas...and his dad worked for the US Post Office.  Ahem.

That's clearly NOT the same as President Obama ordering the FBI to help McVeigh blow up one of our own buildings, is it?  Not even close.

The same is true of the actual Saudi Royal inner circle...who have been MERCILESS in dealing with Al Qaeda sympathizers over the years.  Beheadings en masse for anyone even remotely connected to AQ on the peninsula or elsewhere.

Which is what both parties, and quite frankly anyone who has paid any attention to this issue since 2001, already know, understand, and realize is a complete non-issue.

So whenever some rightwing nut needs donations, rating$, or votes, they pull these non papers out of their ass and raise the racism flag...again.

Sound familiar?

Obama says lots of things... 

His comments on Trayvon Martin as the trial was underway.
""My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" Obama said. ""All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves."" America did and Zimmerman was acquitted.

Obama's comments on the justified shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Mr. Obama said. “Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement — guilty of walking while black or driving while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentment and hopelessness.”. Outcome, Ferguson Riots.

In 2011 Obama sided with the Occupy Wall Street movement. 

""American people understand that not everybody's been following the rules,"" he said. ""These days, a lot of folks doing the right thing are not rewarded. A lot of folks who are not doing the right thing are rewarded. That will express itself until 2012 and beyond until people feel they are getting back to old-fashioned American values.""
 The movement went nowhere and caused major property damage where ever it went.

When in Egypt in 2009 speaking in Cairo he pledged, ""to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.""

As the Arab Spring began he commented, ""There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be.""

It's fun and easy, my favorite so far is Eskom.

&gt;The project, by South Africa's state-owned Eskom utility, is intended to address a worsening power shortage. The loan is controversial due to the 26 million tons of CO2 emissions per year that the plant will emit when completed, making it one of the largest single sources of carbon emissions in the world. South Africa has sought U.S. support for the project  from senior levels at the Department and our Ambassador in Pretoria.

[Spoiler, don't worry Eskom got their plant built and got the loan](http://venturesafrica.com/south-africa-opens-first-power-station-in-20-years-in-order-to-end-electricity-crisis/) and the Clinton foundation got a donation.

It is interesting getting into a discussion with a Staunch Hillary supporter because they become entrenched when you are only discussing one or two issues. Regardless of the severity these issues are often dismissed as being republican agenda, or trivial. Even something as severe as taking money from special interests is seen as status quo, so why is it a problem? 

So to have a good listing of her record is a great reference tool to have on hand when having a discussion with anyone who supports Hillary. Oh sure you're not likely to even budge the staunchest of supporters, however it is very condemning to see all this together when discussing it with a Hillary supporter who is only voting for her because of either name recognition or because she is a woman. When you present the actual facts it is amazing how quickly people turn to Bernie who haven't drunken too much of the Hillary Koolaid and let go of all sense of reality. 

In addition to what you posted, i been putting together a spreadsheet of all the times that Hillary lied, flip flopped, been associated with someone corrupt, or has done anything questionable that would be indicative to a behavior more closely tied with known corrupt individuals. 

So between these 2 pieces of collected information I feel really good about talking to any fence sitter because I can present a really strong case why Hillary is an extremely bad choice for Americans, only represents special interests, and would only further eliminate the middle class and increase hardships on the poor.

I am not sure that Hillary would always use the Military first. But she would be willing to use Diplomacy first to impose her foreign policy goals, definitely.

In the FISMA report, the Office of Inspector General will cite weaknesses to enterprise-wide security they consider to be a significant deficiency in accordance with OMB M-11-33. **The Department acknowledges the weaknesses identified by the OIG, but does not agree that any of the findings, either individually or collectively, rise to the level of a significant deficiency that would require treating the matter as an additional material weakness in accordance with OMB M-11-33 which states “a significant deficiency is defined as a weakness in an agency’s overall information systems security program... that significantly restricts the capability of the agency to carry out its mission or compromises the security of its information, information systems, personnel, or other resources, operations, or assets. In this context, the risk is great enough that the agency head and other agencies must be notified and immediate or near-immediate action must be taken.”**

"37671",1460811911,"Now, 4 interesting questions: 


1.    Was she reimbursed for the cost of her email server and support services by the State Department.
2.    Was her server included in the Federal Information Systems Inventory (Required by OMB A-130, among others places.)
3.    Was her server included in the State Department's annual audits and reviews for compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, and were there any findings relevant to her server.
4.    Did she withhold information about her server to prevent it from being included in these audits or discussions with auditors and the Inspector General.


As an auditor, who would very likely communicate with executives through email, or at least see executive emails as evidence of the performance of certain control activities, it would be trivial to show that her email was not connected to the other agency systems in the Audit Reports and the required underlying documentation, if her server was not included in the audit and required risk management processes.

Specifically, the following controls were implemented:

**The FY 2009 inventory data call was initiated in early November 2008.**

**Routine quarterly inventory data calls were made, and they reminded bureau and post systems owners to report new systems and significant changes to systems to ensure the accuracy of their FISMA-reportable inventory.**

**FISMA requires the Department to keep an inventory of information systems.

Not caring if Sanders supporters, read Progressives, ""flake out"" on Clinton isn't actually the biggest worry that the Democrats have. Their peril is three-fold:

First, they risk losing Senate and House seats in swing districts to Republicans, areas that are winnable if overall turnout is high, but are vulnerable to an ""enthusiasm"" gap if negative campaigning drives moderate voters and independents away from the polls.

Second, they face the prospect of losing local, state, and federal seats to left-leaning third parties and independent candidacies in their most democratic districts. The assumption that voters will either vote the Democratic ticket, or ""flake out"" is wildly optimistic. Angry voters with the option to vote for local third party candidates without creating any risk of Republican victories could install public officials to the left of the Democrats in many constituencies nationwide.

Third, in most places the Democratic and Republican nominees will not be the only names on the ballot. Perhaps the party loyalists should ask Al Gore for advice on underestimating the impact that a small percentage of ""protest votes"" can have in a swing state where Republicans have repeatedly engaged in voter suppression.

The smart move is for the party to back a move to standardize primary election procedures throughout the country for future election cycles, and to establish strict transparency and disclosure rules for candidates and lobbyists or PACs of all types associated with the party and set a standard clearly higher than the Republicans.

&gt;[Major Findings](http://www.colorofcrime.com/2016/03/the-color-of-crime-2016-revised-edition/)

&gt;    The evidence suggests that if there is police racial bias in arrests it is negligible. Victim and witness surveys show that police arrest violent criminals in close proportion to the rates at which criminals of different races commit violent crimes.

&gt;    There are dramatic race differences in crime rates. Asians have the lowest rates, followed by whites, and then Hispanics. Blacks have notably high crime rates. This pattern holds true for virtually all crime categories and for virtually all age groups.

&gt;    In 2013, a black was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder, and 12 times more likely to murder someone of another race than to be murdered by someone of another race.

&gt;    In 2013, of the approximately 660,000 crimes of interracial violence that involved blacks and whites, blacks were the perpetrators 85 percent of the time. This meant a black person was 27 times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. A Hispanic was eight times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa.

&gt;    In 2014 in New York City, a black was 31 times more likely than a white to be arrested for murder, and a Hispanic was 12.4 times more likely. For the crime of “shooting” — defined as firing a bullet that hits someone — a black was 98.4 times more likely than a white to be arrested, and a Hispanic was 23.6 times more likely.

&gt;    If New York City were all white, the murder rate would drop by 91 percent, the robbery rate by 81 percent, and the shootings rate by 97 percent.

&gt;    In an all-white Chicago, murder would decline 90 percent, rape by 81 percent, and robbery by 90 percent.

&gt;    In 2015, a black person was 2.45 times more likely than a white person to be shot and killed by the police. A Hispanic person was 1.21 times more likely. These figures are well within what would be expected given race differences in crime rates and likelihood to resist arrest.

&gt;    In 2015, police killings of blacks accounted for approximately 4 percent of homicides of blacks. Police killings of unarmed blacks accounted for approximately 0.6 percent of homicides of blacks. The overwhelming majority of black homicide victims (93 percent from 1980 to 2008) were killed by blacks.

&gt;    Both violent and non-violent crime has been declining in the United States since a high in 1993. 2015 saw a disturbing rise in murder in major American cities that some observers associated with “depolicing” in response to intense media and public scrutiny of police activity.

","Reddit"
"38057",1460826386,"There is an argument to be made that the new crime wave didn't appear *because* we began applying stricter incarceration and police protocols, saying we should scrap them because the crime rate went down is like saying you don't need river levees because you haven't had any floods. Violent crime peaked in the late 80's and early 90's, in response there were reforms made to lengthen prison sentences and increase police presence in high crime areas. Obviously correlation doesn't always prove causation but it is interesting to note that the crime rate declined substantially after the ""tough on crime"" laws.

[Various people who attended those private speeches has been interviewed by the media, and they described those speeches as the gushy.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/clinton-speeches-218969) Some reported that she sound like a managing director. We know that in those speeches she definitely did not go and tell them to cut it out. Before Sanders and Trump, taking money from Wall Street was just par for the course. Everyone on the GOP did it and Hillary probably did it less than all of them, so it was no big deal. But then Sanders and Trump came around, and all of a sudden those speeches became completely toxic. 

So I am pretty sure that is exactly the smoking gun we are looking for. Not like secret promises to work with them for favors or anything. But like, ""you guys are heroes, you help drive this economy and are a big reason why America is the great country that it is."" Stuff like that. Empty platitudes in the past, but will sink her campaign now. We know that is at least in there, and that is probably good enough. 

If she say anything about running for president or become the future president, that is illegal and we can pack up and go home. I personally don't think that is in there, cause she is a lawyer by trade and would not do something so stupid. If there is a Freudian slip, which is entirely possible, then she is in some real shit. 

Here is my biggest worry. Those speeches were pretty public events, each had thousands of people attending, and she made a lot of them. So it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a recording out there somewhere. this is completely expected. I am worried that someone is waiting to release them in the general election. I know trump would put up a million dollar bounty for a recording, and frankly i think they are sitting on one already. 

This combined with the active FBI investigation into her emails which already shows she has been at least careless with classified material. We are just waiting to see if that carelessness adds up to negligence or gross negligence.

So yes, America is dependent on money. America like other Empires before it needs to tax other countries in order to afford the imperialism, weapons and so on. That's also why America has to deal with other countries. Say, NATO requires that members spend 2% of their GDP on their military in order to keep them ready. And if they do spend 2% of their GDP, the American companies that create weapons, aircrafts and so on would get a major slice out of that. That's a kind of tax.

When America makes other countries to participate in the development process of the F-35 by charging some R&amp;D money from them and by making them to buy the aircrafts once they are ready, America is also charging tax from them in a certain way. Even if those aircrafts could then need a continuing license from America in order to operate by means of daily updates of softwares and so on.

America also popularized the way to make money without having to work for it. That's what makes people rich: to earn their money without having to work for it. Ambitious young people in America dream of coming up with their own Ponzi schemes.

Money can be a good thing. But it needs to be regulated. Otherwise we could say have companies exploring Fracking and burning 90% of their excess of natural gas since all they care about is oil. The waste though further contributes to climate change.

"39233",1460817578,"[Link](https://www.scribd.com/doc/308299698/Cavanaugh-v-Bartelt) to the case.  

In looking up this case, it appears that the plaintiff, Stephen W. Cavanaugh, brought this case as pro se plaintiff meaning he had no legal representation.  This case, in my opinion, was decided incorrectly and with adequate counsel should be reversed on appeal and allowed to progress.  The Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to 10(b)(6).

While I couldn't read the Complaint, it appears that Cavanaugh sued prison officials pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages because he was denied (1) access to wear religious clothing; (2) ability to congregate for weekly worship services and classes; and (3) right to receive communion.  The prison officials denied his requests because they concluded that ""FSMism was a parody religion.""

The Court goes through a lengthy historical detail regarding evolution and briefly discusses the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  While I do not have access to the motion to dismiss, I imagine the arguments made within are parroted in this decision in whole.  It ultimately holds that the religion is in fact a parody before analyzing the legal arguments.

Cavanaugh's claims: (1) Violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of religion of the US Constitution; (2) Article I, §4 of the Nebraska Constitution; (3) Equal Protection provisions of the US Constitution; and (4) Article I, §3 of the Nebraska Constitution.  The Court construed the Complaint as raising a claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) U.S.C. §2000cc.

The Court first analyzed RLUIPA which requires protection against government action when the government's conduct imposes (1) a substantial burden (2) on a religious exercise.  In analyzing the ""religious exercise,"" the Court held that RLUIPA may only be raised to protect sincere religious beliefs and not secular ways of life.  The Court essentially rules that FSMism is not a religion but a parody, and equates the religious  texts to that of Jonathan Swift's ""Modest Proposal"" which advocates cannibalism.  Ruling that FSMism is not a religion, it is not awarded protection under RLUIPA.

There is no cause of action for money damages under RLUIPA against state officials acting in their official capacities, so the claim is barred by sovereign immunity.  Thus the Court held that Cavanaugh failed to state a claim for relief, so his claim for injunctive relief was dismissed.

His First Amendment claim is dismissed because, as a pro se claimant, he failed to state an alleged injury-- i.e. argue that he was substantially burdened and required to alter his behavior. 

His Equal Protection claim is dismissed essentially because the Court ruled that the officials ""considered Cavanaugh's request in good faith and concluded, reasonably, that FSMism was satirical and required no accommodation.""

His state claims were dismissed because they offered the same protections as their federal counterparts.

The plaintiff was offered no leave to amend his Complaint, and the Order was final. 

EDIT: It is worth noting that the IRS has approved the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster tax exempt status 501(C)3.

"41120",1460815183,"&gt; I'm curious as to where to go for honest politician information.

This doesn't exist for various reasons. Journalists are people too and they have their own prejudices. Even when reporting facts, they can change the way their reporting will be perceived either by omission or commission (associating something to something else which may not necessarily relevant). So, the media is effectively divided into two kinds: those who lie blatantly, and those who do it with a lot of sophistication.

Otherwise, you could go with what Crichton referred to as [the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect](http://web.archive.org/web/20080312214444/http://www.michaelcrichton.com/speech-whyspeculate.html):

&gt; Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I call it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)

&gt; Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

&gt; In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

&gt; That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect.","Reddit"

If you watch events as they happen and watch how the events are reported you start to understand the biases from the various sides. It's quite something to see how the major media drives a narrative instead of simply reporting what's happening. 

You'll realize that it's not so much what *is* reported, but what is *not*. The bias of omitting very relevant facts, ignoring key details. 

An easy way to begin understanding the way the media lies is this: When you hear or read news reporting that seems to go against simple common sense, try looking a little deeper and look at why the opposite of what seems real is reported at truth. u/ksryn touched on this with the ""wet streets cause rain"" example.

I think what may be more important is whether or not they're really doing journalism, using research and investigation to uncover stories, or if they're doing hype-man styled punditry.  For TV, [PBS Newshour](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/) and [BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news) have their biases for sure, but for an undecided voter who wants more balanced coverage, you may find them to be more comfortable to watch on TV than anything on MSNBC, CNN and Fox News.

**Just scare tactics here. The company is simply trying to strong-arm the local government.**   

The current minimum wage is $10.00  and it will slowly rise to $15 over the next 6 years.   If American Apparel was really worried about labor cost they could have built their garment factory in say Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina or Tennessee all of which do not have a state minimum wage and thus starting pay is $7.25 an hour.  For some reason however they find LA a desirable location for their factory so I call bullshit.

1)""I used to pay $5 to get this sewn, and now it costs $6.50,"" Seo said, holding up a patterned dress. ""But my customer doesn't want to pay that, so I can't sell it anymore.""

People have no problem paying $1.50 more. Especially when their wages just went from 8 dollars an hour to gradually increasing to 15 an hour. The problem is companies like this see an opportunity to ship it overseas and pay $2 to get it sewn and can keep their prices the same. Maximizing their profit margin.(this is a problem with trade deals) And then blame the minimum wage for them leaving.

&gt;""it can be difficult to find skilled workers who can afford to live in the city.""

And then this bit. It is difficult because these skilled workers aren't going to work at a wage that doesn't cover living expenses. This problem is created by companies like American Apparel who refuse to pay their employees a wage that is reasonable.

Also, what they don't tell you is American Apparel has spent millions on lawsuits. They are poorly managed and have had plenty of issues and have made shitty decisions when it has came to the business. Now they have a scape goat. So they blame cutting jobs on other factors instead they just have completely sucked at managing the business. But it looks better blaming others.

I don't think this debate is going to change polls much (if at all) because while this was probably Clinton's worst debate performance of the campaign so far, it was also, arguably, Sanders's worst.

You bring up a good point, but is it realistic to think that Sanders' proposal will contain the cap?

&gt; Emphasis mine.
&gt;&gt; An FTT of the magnitude he is proposing, 0.5% on the value of every equity transaction, will kill liquidity in the marketplace, which most economists believe will lead to volatility. This seems counter productive to stabilizing Wall Street.

It will definitely have some reduction on liquidity, part of the beauty of the tax is that it curbs HFT. What other way could you try and curb HFT? Limiting the amount of transactions or only applying the tax to entities that make enough transactions? That seems like it would be a hot mess to regulate. Both sides from Fox to liberal rags have acknowledged danger in high frequency trading &amp; we survived just fine without it. Personally, I struggle to consider that 0.5% is a significant figure.

They do that *also* now. Is the entire world going to simply start ignoring the biggest market?

Not that exact poll, of course, but years ago when he got elected people were shouting about how it will be a new day for race relations and how he would inspire young blacks and so on.

That hasn't happened, and Trump is pointing that out to remind people that race isn't everything, in fact, it apparently had no effect on this situation or even worsened it (google for recent articles on ""obama race relations""), despite *other people* (not Trump) saying for the past 8 years that a black president would make a difference in black communities (but that's not racist?)

I see no reason to believe Trump isn't simply using the word ""thug"" as the word ""thug,"" not as a veiled racial slur. Here's the definition (first one on google):

&gt; a violent person, especially a criminal.

So: other people made racist comments for years, Trump calls them out on it, then calls violent people ""thugs"" (which is what the word means), and *Trump* gets branded a racist. 

Wut?","Reddit"
"43156",1460794499,"&gt;why is Barack Obama's race relevant to the conversation?

Don't be obtuse. Blacks made him the spokesperson in charge for all black controversy and issues. See William Gates and every other minuscule incident involving blacks.

&gt;When there are riots in a mostly white place and there is a white president?

When there is a huge riot centered around a movement called white lives matter then I'm sure the white president will be asked to give his thoughts on the matter. Till then...

&gt;Does anyone think the race of the president is somehow relevant since it is the same as the race of the rioters?

Mostly it's not. When the story is big enough then yeah, the president is asked to weigh in. See Kanye.

&gt;Trump mean more than the dictionary definition when he says ""Thugs?"" ""Thugs"" has an original non racial definition and then a much more popular common usage as a slur for black people.

Again, you are being obtuse. As you well know, until recently the term thug was always defined simply as a violent criminal of any race. Thug only became associated strongly with black criminals *after black artists and the culture that follow and mimic them, proudly adopted the term to describe themselves*. So don't cry when others pick up on it and don't act like the current understanding of ""thug"" was created by whites to oppress black people.

"43743",1460815761,"1.) No. There are far more overtly right leaning politicians of prominence than there are overtly ""liberal"" politicians at all. Conservatism is as ""American as apple pie"" and a far more advantageous label than being called a ""liberal"", even by one's supporters.

2.) ""Liberals"" aren't ""persecuting"" NC. Private individuals/companies, mostly in entertainment, which accounts for very little, are choosing to boycott as is there right. No one's ""freedoms"" are being denied. That's just beyond hyperbolic.

3.) Cirque do Soliel can say whatever they like, as can anyone else. That's what true freedom is, but Cirque isn't passing legislation to deny people their civil liberties. 

4.) All people are hypocrites, but the ""Conservatives"" seem to be particularly adept at the task. They set themselves up to fall tanks to their holier-than-thou approach to politics, which inevitably leads to the most severe forms of hypocrisy. Remember these are folks that claim to love Jesus, the Prince of Peace and who told his followers that it is ""easier for a rich man to fit through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven"", whilst simultaneously advocating for war and trying to amass as much wealth as possible.

5.) Liberalism is by no means a religion. On the contrary. Liberals are famously difficult to organize and doing so is often compared to ""herding cats"", whereas Conservatives pride themselves on their group-think and blind faith in their leaders.

6.) Ironic, that you should call Liberals ""the new moral Right"", which implies and acknowledges the belligerent, heavy handed tactics the Right made famous in the first place. 

7.) All liberals want is a two way street. If a business performs transactions with one group/person, they must to the same with all groups/persons. There is no ""right to refuse doing business with anyone"" to deny in the first place. How does a business tell if someone is ""gay"" in the first place? Good ol' fashioned gaydar?

"43999",1460893255,"Populism and anti-establishment feeling has sprung up across the world. 

See success of the Five Star movement in Italy, the election of Syriza in Greece and to a lesser extent the resurgence of the Front National in France and the presence of UKIP in the UK.

At some stage in the last half a decade the trust that people have in both politicians and the political process has dropped off a cliff. 

Now, in continental Europe, proportional voting systems mean that dissatisfaction is very easy to express and alternative parties can spring up, and get a foothold, in a matter of years or even months.

In the US things are different.

The first past the post voting system means that change is both difficult and slow. The quickest way to effect change is from within the existing party structure of the dominant parties the Republicans and the Democrats.

In the case of the Democrats Sanders had a slow start but has gained quickly as he established himself and his platform as an alternative candidate. His lack of name-recognition meant that he was always going to start on the back-foot against the well-known Hillary Clinton. It makes sense that he has picked up as time has gone-on but it looks like it may well be too late. 

The Republicans situation is almost the opposite. The insurgent candidate is immensely well known and has been for decades. This meant that he started on the front-foot. Trump has also benefited from a very split field. While the majority of votes cast have been for non-Trump candidates he was polling higher than any other perspective nominee. And in the winner-takes all states it meant that he mopped up.

We should also bear in mind that this is not the general election. The people voting in Primaries are self-selecting and represent a tiny-fraction of the electorate. And both the insurgent Republican and Democratic candidates are immensely unpopular with huge swathes of voters who identify as the opposite Party. 

Come the general it could be that the prevailing forces of conservatism favour an establishment candidate. 

Populism is a double-edged sword in this race. It can win you the nomination but lose you the general election. ","Reddit"

"44076",1460913761,"&gt;Marc Rich, an international fugitive who Bill Clinton pardoned him in the final hours of his presidency. In 1983, Rich was indicted on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo, a time when U.S. citizens were being held hostage after the 1979 Iranian revolution.

&gt;Had Rich been convicted, he would have been sentenced to 300 years in prison.

&gt;Critics say that Rich's pardon had been bought, as his family had donated over US$1 million to the Democratic Party, including US$100,000 to Hillary Clinton's 2000 New York Senate campaign.

&gt;Clinton said that a major motivating factor behind his decision to pardon Rich were pleas from Israeli politicians

"44139",1460911392,"In terms of foreign policy, I think Hillary Clinton will be the best out there.   I will tell you why.  For years, I leaned somewhat towards the isolationist policy similar to that of Ron Paul, and perhaps Bernie Sanders too.  But from what I have seen in the last 8 years, I concluded that this isolationistic view was naive.  If the USA completely withdraws from intervention everywhere in the world, it will have a great impact on the US economy.  Gasoline will be $7/gallon.  Travel will be much more expensive.  Things will be much more costly.  I don't think Americans can deal with this.  But once you intervene, it's very hard not to be aggressive.  Look at Russia, China, Iran, etc.  Whenever they sense weakness from the US, they make a move.  China in Southeast Asia. Russia in the Middle East.  It's like football, if you don't watch, they gain a few yards.  So, the reality is you have to keep these guys in check.  What makes things complicated is that with China in particular, you also do business with them.  So, it requires a very sophisticated leader who is willing to participate in diplomacy as well as is prepared to be strong if necessary.  This is why I think Clinton is the great fit for this role at this time.  I don't think she's as hawkish as these guys portrayed her.  Don't forget she championed the ""reset"" with Russia.  It was successful for a while, when she was in office.  I think Clinton possesses a balanced understanding of diplomacy and military engagement that is better than anyone else in this race.

&gt;Allow Government to Negotiate Drug Prices (79%)
&gt;
&gt;Give Students the Same Low Interest Rates as Big Banks (78%)
&gt;
&gt;Universal Pre-Kindergarten (77%)
&gt;
&gt;Fair Trade that Protects Workers, the Environment, and Jobs (75%)
&gt;

Americans today are selfish assholes who can't equate this fact. You've been thought to think that you can have this and still not pay higher taxes. You cannot. 

You need to ask yourself: What is more important to you? 35% tax rates or all these programs. That is really what it comes down to. 

Even Sanders is guilty of pulling this trick on you. Thinking that you can have it both. Although, granted, he's been mentioning it briefly at times. Hillary and the others have understood though. That you all actually want both. So they are forced to find a middle ground. Promising social programs and only manage to deliver some that is good enough for the general public. While doing tax breaks at the same time. That is a recipe for disaster. And you are to blame for it when you ask for both extended social programs and tax breaks. ","Reddit"

Here's the thing, though. If you're a senator and you plan to work until you die (which Bernie clearly intends to do; he's 74 years old, is running for PotUS and is one of the most passionate people in Washington)... why the fuck do you need to save for retirement?

That's money that you will never ever see or use.

Americans are obsessed with hoarding money. If you have a job you don't plan to continue performing after 60, then that's fine. You need to have a nice piggy bank saved up. But there are plenty of valid ways to handle your retirement. Continuing to work if you are able to do so is one of them. Why stash away money you will get 0% use out of? Couple this with the fact that senators receive a pension after retirement that averages around $40-70k a year (based on years of service and whether they're in CSRS or FERS plan), and this becomes a pretty silly point to even bring up.

Do I think it's a definite gray area of conflict of interest? Certainly. Although I don't think $200K is that much to someone like Hillary, it's still dodgy to take money from an industry that has too much influence already.

But do I think the speeches themselves contain a bunch of smoking gun gotchas? No way. I've been to events like this, and most likely if people did get their hands on the transcripts, they'd be bored out of their skulls reading them. The least boring scenario is that Hillary actually said something substantive, and you get an idea of her philosophy on how to change / govern the world. But it's not going to be stuff like, ""Make sure I get elected, and I'll make sure your industry is allowed to operate how it wants.""

Even if there *is* such an arrangement, that's a back room deal, not something she is announcing to the rank and file employees of a big company. First of all, that's not how these things are done, and second, in case you hadn't noticed, Hillary pays a *lot* of attention to what information gets into whose hands (hence the private email servers).

Of course, I'm lying a bit here. I actually do understand the drive to get transcripts released.

That kind of statement would hurt her among many liberals who, like Sanders, genuinely believe that the business of Wall Street is fraud.

&gt;...here's what I think: We know she has the transcripts because her standard speech contract requires that she has a transcriptionist to record her remarks. We also know that the Clinton Foundation was sometimes the recipient of those speaking fees, and that her server contained emails and documents related to the Clinton Foundation. We know that the contents of her server were backed up by a data management company who sorted those materials when the server contents were subpoenaed, and that a full record was stored in the cloud, apparently unbeknownst to Clinton or her team, and that that's how the FBI retrieved the 30,000 deleted personal emails. We also know that the Clinton Foundation is under investigation. So, what if, if we speculate here a bit, those transcripts were on the server? What if they are now part of the FBI's investigations? She couldn't release them if she wanted to, and we can't get them through FOIA because she wasn't in office when she gave them.

"44411",1460911872,"**Bob Graham and the Missing 9/11 Report Pages**

Posted on May 12, **2015**	by Kevin Ryan

The media has taken an increasing interest in the 28 pages that were redacted from the 9/11 Joint Congressional Inquiry Report. The stories usually feature one of the Inquiry’s leaders, former Senator Bob Graham, who has claimed that the missing pages point to involvement of the government of Saudi Arabia. Although Saudi complicity is in no way surprising, facts that are often overlooked suggest that Graham’s actions may not be entirely straightforward. This leads independent researchers to raise concerns about his intentions and those concerns are justified.

To begin with, Graham never calls for release of other documents collected by the government’s 9/11 investigators, most of which are still held secret. That includes the majority of 9/11 Commission documents, of which only a fraction have been released—with much of the content redacted. The release of Commission documents is hindered by claims that they are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because they are congressional records. Nonetheless, the public deserves to see documents that might answer critical questions.

Here is some info I posted before on some of the shadiness from the last Clinton presidency:

If they do go back, and I hope they don't, let's ensure they understand what is to stay in the house when they depart this time.

[""After they were criticized for taking $190,000 worth of china, flatware, rugs, televisions, sofas and other gifts with them when they left, the Clintons announced last week that they would pay for $86,000 worth of gifts, or nearly half the amount.""](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121856&amp;amp;page=1)

Also:
""Lawmakers are questioning Clinton’s desire to rent expensive office space in New York City at government expense. Because of the contention, the former president’s foundation has offered to pay at least $300,000 of an estimated $790,000 annual rent for the office Clinton favors.
**Mrs. Clinton, the new senator from New York, has faced questions about the propriety of accepting the gifts in the period between her election and her swearing-in.** Senate rules would have limited what she could accept had she been a senator.
Members of both parties also have criticized Clinton for granting scores of eleventh-hour clemency requests, including the pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive in Switzerland from 51 counts in the United States of tax evasion and fraud.""

Are you sure you want these people back in office? Seriously.

Edit: what do ya know, Marc Rich was a hedge fund manager. Check this out: 

""Marc Rich (born Marcell David Reich; December 18, 1934 – June 26, 2013) was an **international commodities trader, hedge fund manager, financier and businessman**. He was best known for founding the commodities company Glencore and for being indicted in the United States on **federal charges of tax evasion and illegally making oil deals with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis**. He was in Switzerland at the time of the indictment and never returned to the United States.  **He received a controversial presidential pardon from U.S. President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, Clinton's last day in office.**""

This is a totally pro-Sanders article but the headline above manages to miss this major point.   Possibly because no one would pay attention if the actual headline was used.   But since it mentions this indirectly, let's look at it.  The problem is two fold.

1.  Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will be carpet bombed by Adelson, Pope, the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Bush Rangers. Sanders is not equipped to deal with it. And rejecting Clooney just makes him worse off. 

2.  Democrat Congressional campaigns also need money  and Bernie Sanders has no clue how to handle this. 

The entire attempt to get rid of Citizens United will end in a fiasco if there is no money for Congressional campaigns and apparently Bernie Sanders has no plans.","Reddit"

We're really not as dependent on Middle Eastern Oil as we used to be and that just becomes more and more true every year. 

Honestly, just look at the Data from 2009 through today.. You'll see it starting to take a big fuckin' nose dive.

OPEC Imports aren't what makes up a majority of our Oil anymore and now that Sanctions have been lifted on Iran they've had a direct influence on Saudi Arabia's (used to be cornered) Market and now Saudi Arabia's hurting. 

Honestly in a lot of ways (this is speculation though so take it with a grain of salt) this is probably why we tried so hard to get this Nuclear Deal passed with Iran, to try and squeeze Saudi Arabia as much as we could after all these years. 

Edit: 

One thing I forgot to mention.. I'm not sure what the Imports look like for OTHER countries though.

[Here's a photo](http://imgur.com/wxZ3Q9K) I took from the sit-in on the steps.  You can see the rally on the other side of the police line.  For the most part the Capitol city police were friendly.  I spent some time during processing talking to one of them about the Warriors for a while.

Here are a couple of short videos of the event: [one from the march](https://vid.me/vFFE) as we reached the Capitol and [one from the steps](https://vid.me/bjQA) right as we were about to begin the sit-in.

There was a 3 hour training session for those participating in the sit-in so many of us were well prepared and well informed.  Many people had participated in the arrests throughout the week and others had lots of experience in protests in years past.  The organization takes nonviolent direct action very seriously.  Members include Noam Chomsky and Lawrence Lessig as well as celebrities like Mark Ruffalo.

Those who chose to sit-in on the steps of the Capitol in violation of the law and be arrested were also fined $50, resulting in $45,000+ in fines.  Some people did go to jail and others were processed on-site (see details in comments below).  Those who chose not to sit-in (the majority) protested in the ""designated"" protest area.

The protests earlier in the week had coverage by better news organizations:

* Sanders doesn't talk too much about himself personally as do other candidates

&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke in unusually personal terms Saturday night about how his fight for the poor has been spurred by his own childhood, saying that there was “constant tension” between his parents over money.

* Father came from Poland and was satisfied with humble life he had as paint salesman. His mother was born and raised in the U.S. and had bigger dreams of wanting their own house. This would create tensions. 

&gt;That was a dream,” he said. “She died at the age of 46. She never achieved that dream.”

* Doesn't like shopping after his experience of having his mother take him to 15+ stores to find the cheapest leather jacket. 

* Hillary Clinton  did a fundraising in California that costed $33K per person. Before that, she listened to five black mothers whose children died to gun violence. 

&gt;“She took notes…Her staff didn’t take the notes. She took the notes. She followed up,” Ms. Carr (Mother of Eric Garner) said. “I do endorse her, but she endorsed us first.”

This election cycle has been completely focused on domestic issues. Personally, I'm ok with Hillary's approach to some of these issues. I like Bernie's approach to several of these as well. However, with foreign policy considered, I just can't vote for Clinton. Even in the last debate, she made a point that she recommended that Obama arm Syrians to fight the regime there. Can we not learn from past mistakes? What happened when the US armed the Mujahideen?

I understand a lot of people have invested a lot of time and energy into his campaign, but if he wins, it seems counter productive to either write in or vote Green.  For starters if you write in Bernie it just won't be counted at all.  I can understand trying to send a message to the DNC, but if Hillary does win with more votes and pledged delegates, what message is that supposed to be exactly?  That the wishes of the majority are not what matter?  That doesn't sound like a very good message to me.

On the other hand, voting third party does sound possible, but has protest votes ever really worked at any time in the past?  It surely didn't work in 2000, and it didn't do any good for the reform party.  Secondly, and this is the big thing, there is a lot at stake this election.  Millions of more people have access to healthcare through insurance now, and the two most likely candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, want to undo the act that gave those people that healthcare.  If you don't have a lot to lose by having a republican as the next president, it may not sound like a bad idea to take a protest vote, but for a lot of people, they have their healthcare/health insurance on the line.  I can't in good conscious vote for someone who does not have a chance to win in the general election, when my vote could be going to someone who does actually have a chance to win.  I don't even need to mention supreme court justices (we are very close to having the first majority progressive court in a long while).

Let me tell yeah, if you wanted real progressive change than this is the exact opposite way to do it. And I mean the presidency. See despite what will inevitably get linked, /r/GrassrootsSelect is not enough as it currently stands. If you want an end to the war on drugs you'd vote for judges, sheriffs, and DA's who end them in your state and community and who could lobby your state government to do that.

But you don't. Bernie or Bust folks have little patience for the tedium of state and local politics. 

You and your fellow compatriots really don't care about progressivism or liberalism because if you did you'd recognize what it takes to get that change done. You'd vote for a libertarian, or trump, or a tea partier just to give a finger to Clinton.

Bring back the Bull Moose logo of Teddy Roosevelt's Progressive Party and run on a foundation of social democracy, campaign finance reform, anti-corruption, green politics, increasing taxes on the wealthiest citizens, a more non-interventionalist foreign policy, prison and drug policy reform, pro-women's and LGBTQ stances, support for election reform (getting rid of the two-party and antiquated FPTP voting system), reduced or free state college tuitions, education reform in maths and sciences with a strong focus on technical and computer skills, protection of net neutrality and personal privacy, and strong support and enforcement of antitrust laws on business monopolies particularly including financial institutions and the fossil fuel energy sector. Possibly also push for wider support and access for young people going into trades in lieu of college and help make it easier to find apprenticeship programs across the board. 

The country badly needs an actual left-wing party to combat the centrist Democrats and Right-Wing Republicans. Start with focus on local elections, city councils, state legislatures, mayoral races and then hopefully move up from there. I imagine a Party like this could easily form an alliance with the Green Party and some of the more liberal members of the Libertarian Party, too. But focusing on local elections before full state or federal races could potentially build a base over time. And if the two-party system dies out, it would be great to have an actual progressive left party to push for in countrywide elections.

It would take a lot of work from a lot of people to make it happen, but something like it could potentially benefit the country greatly in the future. Just my two cents. ","Reddit"

Yeah no. So as it stands the delegate count is 1095 Sanders to 1305 Clinton. That means that of pledged delegates that have been awarded, Clinton has won 54.3% of delegates to Sanders' 45.6%. So she's beating him by 9 points in *pledged* delegates. There are 1651 pledged delegates yet to be awarded. 2026 is a majority of pledged delegates. So Sanders needs 931/1651=56.4% of remaining delegates to have a majority of pledged delegates, which is almost certainly a prerequisite for super delegates switching to his side giving him an outright majority and the nomination.

So he needs to win the remaining races by an average of almost thirteen percentage points when up to this point in the race he has been loosing by an average of about 9 points.

"45256",1460837928,"&gt; Another connection is Giustra, the director of UrAsia Energy Ltd, a British Virgin Islands offshore company registered in May 2005.

&gt; The company wanted to “conduct uranium exploration, development, production and marketing operations and related activities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,” according to a draft of the shareholders’ agreement.

&gt; UrAsia, based in British Columbia, Canada, finalized a deal in September 2005 to buy uranium mines for $500 million in Kazakhstan, according to published reports.

&gt; The deal came after Giustra joined Bill Clinton in Kazakhstan for the launch of a Clinton Foundation health initiative and dined with him and Kazakhstan’s president, among others. The timing prompted questions about whether Bill Clinton played any role in the agreement. Giustra denied that, saying it came after months of negotiations.

&gt; The following year, Giustra, who is also involved in filmmaking and founded Lionsgate Entertainment, made a donation of more than $30 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to published reports.

&gt; In total, Giustra has committed $100 million to the foundation, according to at least one report, though foundation records don’t give an exact amount, saying only that he is one of the largest individual donors giving more than $25 million. In 2007, he started an affiliated charity that bears his name and initially kept its donors secret despite a 2008 agreement between the Clintons and the Obama administration to make public foundation contributors.

George would show off his handy dandy shiny grill, cook up some fabulous chickens and burgers and veggies and his guests would agree that it was indeed the most fabulous indoor grill they had ever seen.

Then George (in an attempt to be fair and show comparison), pulls out a competitor's grill.  He bangs it around, half-breaking it, cooks food that is half-burnt or half raw and everyone agrees that it's an overpriced piece of junk.

&gt;GEORGE CLOONEY:

&gt;Well, I've worked with Secretary Clinton as Secretary particularly when the Sudan and South Sudan were looking to vote for their own independence and it was an incredibly dangerous time for that country. And there were, you know, hundreds of thousands of people's lives at risk.

&gt;And between the Secretary and the Security Council and some of the people on the ground and Kofi Anan and Jimmy Carter and people like that and thousands of people on the ground, we worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen. She understood it. She understood the issues even though we don't have any great reason to pay much attention to Sudan. We don't trade with them. We don't get money from them. I found her to know, to be knowledgeable and to be-- and to care about the issues. And we've worked together since then and I've been a very big fan of hers. But I want to say this: I really like Bernie. I think what he's saying in this election is important if you're a Democrat. Again to have these conversations, I hope he stays in for the entire election and if he were to win the nomination, I will do whatever I can including if asked a fundraiser like this again to try to give him or her, Hillary, I hope she wins a Senate because honestly we see what happens when a President tries to get their Supreme Court justice confirmed without the Senate.

Furthermore it seems to me to be totally principled to not vote for Hilary Clinton should she win the nomination.  We know the basic fundamental differences between these two candidates.  Voting for Hilary because she is the Democratic nominee means voting for everything you are against and these are fundamental differences that will effect the majority of people in this country and the world!  

Furthermore, if you look at the history of big changes in this country that were won by mass movements -- like forcing the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam, and it did not matter who was the president, Democrat or Republican.  When the people take the stage of history, it is like what Alice in Wonderland said about the Queen and her court, ""Why you are all a pack of cards""  They become a house of cards.

To add to this, I think if Bernie Sanders supports Hilary if he does not win, what will this do to the millions of supporters who have rallied to his cause?  What kind of demoralization will that cause.  What will it do to these supporters' belief that people can seem to strongly support the moral causes that Bernie supports and then turn around and support and campaign for the very people who are dead set against these positions.  It is like he just championed these positions like Hilary has been doing lately  -- just to win.

Think of what he has said about Pope Francis and then his turning around to support a person representing the antithesis of these views.

I am demoralized just thinking about this.  I was a radical in the 1960's -1970's.  I saw many becoming enamored of this or that Democratic candidate during elections and therefore stopping their protests against the war or for women's rights, etc.  Then, those people abandoned their campaign pledges  once they were elected.  There is no such thing as lesser evil.  Evil is Evil.

Read Malcolm X on the two parties.  Consider, that Martin Luther King was assassinated after he began to support the anti Vietnam war movement and to more further to the left on military and economic positions and to come closer to Malcolm X.  What might he have said about the Democratic Party.

"45691",1460838152,"I'm not surprised they're with Bernie. I worked at a VERY well known social game company in San Francisco before the company went public and nearly collapsed.

I was so excited when I interviewed there. You could practically push the invisible piles of money out of the way when walking down the halls. The energy was amazing. Everything glittered with promise. I admit it, even at 40 years old, I got sucked right into the cult.

We had meals served in the cafeteria twice a day. Not just buffet, but you could get pizza and paninis to order. There were themed, fully stocked kitchens on each floor and a gym, arcade, and bar on the bottom floor. There was even an indoor basketball court. Yoga classes, acupuncture, and massages. Happy hour with free beer and wine on Fridays. Teams that were making money went to Vegas, Tahoe, even Hawaii.

My team started crunching shortly after I started and we had meals catered to our suite 3 times a day so we didn't have to take the time to leave to get food. Once a week they offered massages and acupuncture in one of our conference rooms so you didn't have to leave the suite. People started working until midnight, 2AM, and finally in the last couple of months some would get applauded for staying overnight. It became a hero culture - who can work the most hours, who's the most committed, who's giving it their all. It started to really feel kind of sick. Stress levels were insane. You'd feel guilty if you left before 9PM, and people often went home and then worked several more hours. If you weren't giving it EVERYTHING, you were failing the team and everyone knew it.

Some people thrived on it. I had a family, and I ultimately failed out from the stress of trying to balance that with the chaos and pressure of work. All of those perks could not make up for the pressure to perform and be a superhero. When I resigned, I could almost physically feel the weight lift from me. When I went back up to the suite after signing the papers with HR, someone said ""Wow, you look so... *happy*."" It felt like the first time I'd smiled in months. Not long after our game launched, the team was disbanded. Some were laid off, some were moved to other projects. Not too long after that the company laid off hundreds of people who had given them everything only to be discarded.

Anyway, my situation is not unique. I knew so many people who were also lured by the promise of perks and equity and eventually discovered they'd signed up for a treadmill that goes 12 miles an hour and will exhaust you before it throws you off. In the Bay Area that company was one of the biggest, but the culture isn't unique. ","Reddit"

Okay, I can see you're really emotional about this so I'll just try to respond calmly. :)

I've been an independent for 27 years (if it matters, I'm 45 and female). My first vote in a general was for Perot and the next two I think were for Browne.

In 2004, I not only voted for Kerry I plastered my U-haul with Kerry signs on my coast-to-coast move. I hated Bush SO much. I didn't love Kerry, and I thought (despite being a liberal) that the DNC was full of shit, but I really wanted us out of the war. It was at the DNC convention that year that I saw a young senatorial candidate give a speech. I turned to my (now ex) husband and said, ""Holy shit, that guy is going to be our first black President.""

I donated to Obama in 2008 and was ecstatic when he won. I really thought he was our best hope. I donated and voted for him again in 2012, but maybe with not as much enthusiasm. 

In all of this, I never registered as a Democrat. Although I aligned with them on some things and sometimes voted a straight blue ticket, I always felt like my vote was my own. *I* would decide which candidates I best aligned with. 

And to be honest, I have *never* liked the Clintons. I remember the Clintons when they were in office. Despite Bill being the ""cool"" President, I didn't like the way they aligned with the Republicans on too many things. Some things just felt really shady. I hated how both of them acted during Monicagate. 

So here we are now and it's 2016 and finally there's a candidate who I really like. He represents ME. He represents US.

So what does the DNC do? Everything they can to keep him down. From the debate schedule to the way DWS wouldn't even *mention* him during interviews the first few months. It was all Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. The way she spoke about him when the data breach happened. The way the top DNC folks spoke dismissively about him and glowingly about Clinton. The way Clinton herself tried to paint him as a sexist because he said people were shouting about guns. The way the Hillary supporters acted on social media. The way the actual media never covered him, or dismissed him when they did. The list goes on and on.

So if he doesn't get the nomination, I am supposed to do... what? Fall in line because the alternative is worse? What message does my vote send? Here's the answer: it says that I'm okay with how this whole thing went down. It says that I support Hillary's policies. It says I support the DNC and their coronation.

I'm sorry, but I've already lived through bad. I've lived through the crushing disappointment of having my candidate (Kerry) lose to the devil. As a country we survived it then and we'll survive it again.

But in the end my vote is my own, and it is not *owed* to anyone. 

If the DNC didn't want to lose my independent vote they should have backed the candidate I wanted to vote for. Don't blame people for not voting for the Democratic candidate. Blame the Democrats for not backing the candidate people wanted to vote for.","Reddit"

Clinton spoke 7103 uninterrupted words

Interruptions (arbitrarily defined as fewer than five words without being interrupted or fewer than 15 without being interrupted three times in a row), mediators, and others (like the guy in the audience) accounted for 3490 words.

Sanders had 75 applause lines, 12 cheers, 1 laughter, and 1 boo.

Clinton had 47 applause lines, 6 cheers, 2 laughters, and 2 boos

Interruptions/mediations caused 32 applause lines, 3 cheers, 2 laughters, and 3 boos

""I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security,""  
 
Obama when asked about Clinton's legal woes,  “I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America’s national security. what I’ve also said is that—and she has acknowledged—that there’s a carelessness, in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes.”

Sound familiar?

Obama says lots of things... 

His comments on Trayvon Martin as the trial was underway.
""My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" Obama said. ""All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves."" America did and Zimmerman was acquitted.

Obama's comments on the justified shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Mr. Obama said. “Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement — guilty of walking while black or driving while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentment and hopelessness.”. Outcome, Ferguson Riots.

In 2011 Obama sided with the Occupy Wall Street movement. 

""American people understand that not everybody's been following the rules,"" he said. ""These days, a lot of folks doing the right thing are not rewarded. A lot of folks who are not doing the right thing are rewarded. That will express itself until 2012 and beyond until people feel they are getting back to old-fashioned American values.""
 The movement went nowhere and caused major property damage where ever it went.

When in Egypt in 2009 speaking in Cairo he pledged, ""to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.""

As the Arab Spring began he commented, ""There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be."" He sided with the Muslim Brotherhood and further destabilized the Middle East...

The system is working as intended. If a single candidate cannot command a majority of delegates come the convention then the Party swings towards a contested or brokered convention. 

This is part of the rules of the game. The candidates get the chance to have (R) next to their name on the ballot paper. The price for this is, and has always been, to sign up to the Republican rules. That letter and that Party endorsement is the key to being competitive in the General. No candidate is forced to seek the Republican nomination. They do it because they would be blown out of the water as an independent.

"47029",1460837053,"The inheritance tax is American and one of the best places to tax

The inheritance tax is often a point of contention between liberals and conservatives. As I will demonstrate, liberals are on the right side of this argument from both an economic and ethical standpoint. I will also debunk the common right talking points.

**From an ethical standpoint**

While Americans have a history of despising taxes, the inheritance is as American as you can get (when I talk about inheritance tax, I mean very large inheritances). Your lot in life should be based off of hard work, skill acquisition, education, experience, ingenuity, the value of your contributions to society, and perhaps a little luck. These are American values which liberals embrace. Conservatives, on the other hand, believe that your lot in life should be determined by the vagina you were born out of it. These are not American values. There is a fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives when it come to wealth creation.

It is also there to prevent large inter generational wealth transfers that could pervert a functional Democracy. America was founded on the idea that power and wealth was not handed down like Kings and Queens handed it down to their offspring, but created by individual endeavor.

**From an economic standpoint**

The inheritance is a very efficient tax. It does not create a lot of market distortions. For example, it is not like high sales tax, which could lead to people not buying as much as they would otherwise. If anything, large inheritances creates perverse distortions as it removes people from the labor force who would have otherwise participated. From an economic perspective it is difficult to find a more efficient tax.

**Common RW Talking Points.**

**It is theft** - If you take that view, then all taxes could be argued as theft, and you are essentially arguing from a point of anarchy.

**It is class warfare** - Every dollar not captured by the inheritance tax means that the government needs to tax elsewhere. This will lead to higher sales tax and/or higher income tax. Therefore you are pushing the tax burden onto the poor (sales tax) or working class (income tax). Essentially, you are waging class warfare also, but against the lower and middle income classes.

**It will bankrupt small businesses and farms** - No it won't. Only 0.003 of all estates are captured by the estate tax will be small businesses and farms, and they will owe a modest amount (14.3%). There is no evidence that these estates face liquidity constraints.
http://www.cbpp.org/research/impact-of-estate-tax-on-small-businesses-and-farms-is-minimal

**Parents should be able to provide for their children** - Most parents will not die until until they have grandchildren. Therefore, when they pass their estate onto their children, the ""children"" are already middle-aged and have a family of their own. Therefore, if your children are waiting for you to die in order to make something of themselves, then you failed as a parent. They should be financially dependent already. Plus, only large estates are tax, currently over $10 million. If your children cannot survive without more than $10 million in wealth, then you failed as a parent.

**It is double taxed** - So what and not quite true.  There is no law against double taxation and many things are doubled taxed.  Many of the end items you buy have already been taxed before in the production process, through at least labor, but then we also have a sales tax. 

Plus, it is not quite true.  Usually, capital gains are taxed when the asset is sold or disposed of and the gain is “realized.” But if a person holds an asset that grows in value until his or her death, that “unrealized” capital gain is forgiven, and neither the heir of the estate nor the deceased person is taxed on it. These unrealized capital gains account for a significant proportion of the assets held by large estates — ranging from 32 percent for estates worth between $5 million and $10 million to as much as about 55 percent of the value of estates worth more than $100 million (see pie chart). 
http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-the-estate-tax 

Cons hate the estate tax and would like to see it abolished. However, when asked where is a better place to tax, they come up short. Instead, they would rather tax current income, shift the burden onto the poor with higher sales taxes, increase taxes on home owners through higher property taxes. These taxes create greater economic inefficiency and ""punish"" current success, but sadly cons would rather punish current success rather than unearned success.","Reddit"

Buprenorphine is also being looked at as a potential anti depressant and is currently being used as a pain killer in some instances (butrans patch).

It binds to the opioid receptors so strongly that it knocks off any other opioid drug currently in the system and makes it extremely difficult to get high off opiates while on it. The naloxone formulation makes it very uncomfortable to IV (and newer strip formulations make it even more difficult).

While it's still an opioid, meaning the patients would still be opioid dependent while on treatment, it has the capacity to interrupt many of the destructive patterns involved in opiate addiction, with a fraction of the side effects of methodone, and even without insurance it's cheaper than a street drug addiction.

"47729",1460843487,"&gt;My question is- Couldn't these corporations just relocate their headquarters to another country with more lenient corporate tax policies, thus avoiding being taxed by the US altogether?

First, the rich [don't flee high-tax states](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/29/135813061/studies-rich-dont-flee-high-tax-states).  The same is true of countries.  There is a point at which wealthy people would leave a country due to high taxation, but simply raising taxes in a responsible way, as would be required for any bill to pass Congress, would not bring us to that level of taxation.

For example, he's proposing that income over $10 million - his highest proposed tax bracket - should be taxed at 52%.  For comparison, before Reagan's presidency in the early 80s, the highest tax bracket was taxed at 70%.  Reagan and Congress passed the [Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Recovery_Tax_Act_of_1981), which slashed the top tax bracket rate to 50%, just 2% less than what Sanders thinks it should be.  We had plenty of rich people in the 70s, 60s, and 50s.

Concerning corporations: Sanders has proposed policies that would save them money.  For example, he wants to replace health insurance with a Medicare For All single-payer system.  Health insurance premiums are one of the largest payroll expenses for US employers, even more so since Obamacare mandated health insurance for employees who work at least 30 hours per week.  A single-payer system would reduce healthcare costs by more equitably distributing the burden of paying for healthcare, removing the need to raise healthcare prices to make a profit for insurance company shareholders, and by giving the government more power to negotiate fair prices.

Next, when Sanders talks about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure improvements, like expanding public transit, fixing lead-contaminated water systems, and improving schools, he's talking about $1 trillion in federal contracts that would go to American companies.  Typically, such economic stimulus contracts require the contractors to purchase American-made parts and equipment when it is possible to do so.  That would be a massive business opportunity for American companies.

Raising the minimum wage would put more disposable income in people's pockets.  This would create more demand for products and services, which are business opportunities for providers of goods and services.  A strong middle class is the best engine for economic growth.  Providing the rich with low taxes won't cause them to open new businesses if there is not enough demand for their products.

From [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-100-economy-why-the-us-needs-a-strong-middle-class-to-thrive/257385/):

The...notion at the center of Hanauer's talk was that the innovators and businessmen are not, in fact, ""job creators""--that the fate of the economy rests instead in the hands of the middle class. So Hanauer wants to tax rich guys like himself more, to pay for investments to nurture middle-class families.

""We've had it backward for the last 30 years,"" Hanauer said at the TED conference. ""Rich businesspeople like me don't create jobs. Rather, they are a consequence of an ecosystemic feedback loop animated by middle-class consumers."" When the middle class thrives, he said, ""businesses grow and hire, and owners profit.""

-end quote-

Finally, and perhaps the most important point, Bernie Sanders is going to have to work with Congress.  There is no possible Congress that would pass a tax increase that would destroy the economy.  Economists and business leaders differ about exactly how high taxes could go before they begin to damage the economy more than they help it - and a lot of that depends on what the taxes are spent on - but it is simply a fact that taxes on the wealthy could be higher than they are without damaging the economy.  What Sanders would hammer out with Congress remains to be seen, but it is unrealistic to assume that his agenda would be enacted without carefully examining the economic consequences and tailoring the tax rate to avoid unwarranted harm.

If that last part throws some people and makes them think that his agenda won't happen, remember that almost every other major country on earth has achieved healthcare for all.  We can do it too.  Also, look at how Obama's been treated by Congress - would Hillary be treated any better?  Realistically, any Democratic president is going to face a Congress that's unwilling to cooperate until 2018 at the earliest, with 2020 after redistricting being more likely.  And finally, it's not just about what Sanders wants to do, but also about what he wouldn't do.  He wouldn't get us into another regime-change war.  He wouldn't agree to something like cutting Social Security as part of a bargain with Republicans.  He wouldn't appoint a Supreme Court Justice who doesn't want to overturn Citizens United.  He wouldn't let white collar crimes committed by powerful CEOs go unpunished.  He wouldn't use the DEA to crush the legalized and medical marijuana vendors in states that voted to allow it.","Reddit"

And to that end, lobbying is a significant cost to industries, but less so than they think they stand to lose without it. If simply moving out of the country would free them, that'd be the cheaper alternative. Even the Saudis hire lobbyists.

In a similar parallel, donating to PACs to elect politicians who will lower or not change the tax rate on the wealthy is also a significant cost, but less so than they feel they stand to lose. Expatriating would be a cheaper alternative, and the wealthy do it now anyways. The biggest factor in play is the willingness to move all of one's life and business to another country in order to not be flagged in by the IRS's Substantial Presence Test. (You can read more [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-rich-people-move-to-low-tax-countries-to-get-richer), that's what I was summarizing)

America's a massive consumer economy, and stands to grow larger as the minimum wage increases, and there's not much penalty to leaving because free trade agreements don't interrupt access to that economy.

"48086",1460840419,"It might help to clarify what is actually occurring - and why it is occurring.

As nations industrialize, labor demands get more complex.  Where once it was sufficient to have a willing attitude and a strong back, now laborers need a decent mind to go with it.  They need to learn and apply more complex, narrow skill sets.

But as other nations also move through this process, they start at the low end first - and are able to deliver the low end labor far more efficiently.  As a result, there is minimal demand in the more developed nations for low end labor.

However, there are still *people* at the low end, without the specialized skills they'd need to get better jobs.

Effectively, there is a 'gap' in the labor market where many people fall but no jobs exist.  So those people are forced into the unskilled labor market.

If you raise the minimum wage, you can close this gap somewhat.  But you do so at the expense of the people who would ordinarily be in the unskilled labor market (as opposed to being defaulted into by lack of slightly-more-skilled jobs).  Moreover, the slightly-more-skilled class is still 'underutilized' since they're just getting paid a bit more to do unskilled labor jobs rather than jobs that match their abilities.

Some of those people can potentially be retrained to get them 'past the gap' and into decent jobs.  But, frankly, most of them are either unwilling or unable to make that transition.  They're stuck in a world where the jobs that match their abilities are done by foreigners and all the jobs that are left either exceed their abilities or aren't worth their time.

To make matters worse, raising the minimum wage also encourages the *elimination* of those low-end jobs via automation.  So while you can potentially employ some of those 'gap' workers at jobs they really shouldn't be doing in the first place for semi-decent wages, you're throwing even more people out of work.

I don't believe anyone has come up with a particularly 'good' fix for this problem.  Raising the minimum wage is almost strictly worse than a policy such as guaranteed basic income due to the job-killing impact it has.  Better early education could potentially pay off - if anyone could figure out how to actually deliver it to poor people.  Easier adult trade education/re-education might help out, but there are limits.

But most of the proposals we're seeing from politicians fit nicely into the ""simple, easy and wrong"" category - such as minimum wage increases.","Reddit"

"48216",1460897633,"This is one of those discussions where we don't have all the facts and probably never will. 

If a business is legitimately spending all the money that comes in then they shouldn't need to pay taxes. Problem is we don't know how they are going about getting to zero.

And even if a company isn't making a profit it is still paying employees who pay taxes. The CEO and the board of directors are all paying taxes.

If a mom and pop business did the same thing the IRS wouldn't necessarily disallow it. They would make you prove it was a business and not a hobby. That rule is in place to keep people from starting a cake baking ""business"". Selling two cakes at their kid's bake sale. Then trying to write off all their groceries for the year.  

If you had a hobby that made money you would be expected to pay taxes on that money. But you could certainly offset your profit with any expenses. i.e. if you spent $9 baking a cake and sold it for $10 you would only pay taxes on the $1 profit. But if the cake cost you $11 to make and you sold it for $10 you wouldn't be allowed to write off the dollar.

Edit: [Source:](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-gun-policy/)

&gt; Manufacturer Liability: Gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the misuse of their products, just as any other industry isn’t held accountable for how end-consumers use their products.

&gt; Bernie believes that gun control is largely a state issue because attitudes and actions with regards to firearms differ greatly between rural and urban communities. Nevertheless, Bernie believes there are situations where the federal government should intervene. **He voted in favor of requiring background checks to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of felons and the mentally ill, passing a federal ban on assault weapons, and closing loopholes which allows private sellers at gun shows and on the internet to sell to individuals without background checks.**

&gt; To what extent does Bernie believe that gun regulation should be a federal issue?

&gt; Bernie has voted in favor of a nationwide ban on assault weapons, a nationwide ban on high-capacity magazines of over ten rounds, and nationwide expanded background checks that address unsafe loopholes.

"49535",1460913306,"&gt; Sanders has drawn recent criticism from gun violence prevention advocates and fellow candidate Hilary Clinton over his 2005 vote for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a federal law that gave gun stores — and gun manufacturers — broad immunity from lawsuits. Meanwhile, his support of small gun manufacturers in the U.S. drew praise from the National Rifle Association in March.

FFS.

MSM has been incredibly disingenuous on this issue. Sanders is clearly against allowing military style weapons being sold to civilians as well as in favour of holding makers/sellers liable for manufacturer's defects and wrongful selling practices. He is entirely against immunity under these circumstances but they are taking the part where he stipulates that outside of these circumstances you should *not* be able to sue and presenting it as if he's still saying that you shouldn't be able to sue at all. Nothing regarding Sanders' stance on this issue ever changed.

[Source:](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-gun-policy/)

&gt; Manufacturer Liability: Gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the misuse of their products, just as any other industry isn’t held accountable for how end-consumers use their products.

&gt; Bernie believes that gun control is largely a state issue because attitudes and actions with regards to firearms differ greatly between rural and urban communities. Nevertheless, Bernie believes there are situations where the federal government should intervene. **He voted in favor of requiring background checks to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of felons and the mentally ill, passing a federal ban on assault weapons, and closing loopholes which allows private sellers at gun shows and on the internet to sell to individuals without background checks.**

&gt; To what extent does Bernie believe that gun regulation should be a federal issue?

&gt; Bernie has voted in favor of a nationwide ban on assault weapons, a nationwide ban on high-capacity magazines of over ten rounds, and nationwide expanded background checks that address unsafe loopholes.

With respect to the Sandy Hook lawsuit, [he supports it:] (http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/14/politics/transcript-democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/)

&gt; BLITZER: So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?

&gt; SANDERS: No, I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. **They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.**

He supports it based on this [premise] (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36050659)

&gt; The suit argues that the semi-automatic rifle used in the school shooting is a military weapon and should not have been sold to civilians.

...which is exactly in line with what his stance has always been with respect to assault weapons.

Guess which is the larger group?  Yep, the truck people.  The majority of the people are actually truck people, with a close second being sports car people.  The economy car people will have to accept that they have no real chance of winning.

"50614",1460838699,"That's a whole lot of words to oversimplify our legal system. First of all, for major crimes the prosecutor isn't the one who makes the determination, it's a grand jury that examines the evidence and makes the determination if there should be a trial or not.
For lesser crimes, like you said, the prosecutor looks at the evidence and makes a determination. If there is enough evidence, whether it's physical, eye witnesses, or even if it's circumstantial, that there is a reasonable chance that they might have committed the crime, then they proceed. You're right in that it's not the prosecutor's job to determine guilt or innocence. It's their job to determine whether or not the possibility of guilt exists, and from there to build a case and prove it. What's the alternative? If we only prosecuted people that are 100% bulletproof guilty, we'd end up with a lot of unsolved crimes.

As for your contention that prosecutors are all some kind of robot concerned only with putting the maximum number of people in jail? Don't be a shithead. I mean, yeah, there are assholes in every line of work, and some prosecutors are more interested in making themselves look good by closing out high profile crimes. There are prosecutors who are racists, and will do everything they can to put minorities in jail.

"50615",1460840450,"&gt;They don't believe it's their job to only prosecute guilty people.

Almost every crime has two components. Actus rea, a guilty act, and mens rea, the guilty mind. There are no ""objectively"" guilty people to prosecute. Prosecutors can't read minds. If prosecutors only wanted to prosecute ""the guilty,"" no one would ever be prosecuted.

&gt;[They think] that their job is to accuse everyone they think they can convince a jury is guilty.

That is their job. Again, there are no 'objectively guilty' people running around out there. 

&gt;Imagine, if you will, a case where two criminals - both total scum with long rap sheets - are arrested for something, and each implicates the other as the main criminal actor and themselves as a helpless bystander to their counterpart's actions. The available physical evidence can be played either way. But one of them is white and the other is black, and the jury hearing the case will definitely be white. Guess what a prosecutor is going to do with that situation?

There are a lot of reasons why juries are mostly white, but the alternative to a jury system (usually empowering the judge) is no better at removing systemic abuse.

&gt;An honest, remotely moral person would admit that they don't have enough evidence to confidently state who is the leader, 

That's not the prosecutor's call to make. Again, it's not up to the prosecutor to determine who had the mens rea and/or committed the actus rea. That's up to the jury. It would not be fair for a prosecutor to unilaterally find someone guilty; finding someone innocent without a jury trial is no less unfair. If you can make a prima facie case, let the jury decide.

&gt;They disfigure the concept of justice they are required to advocate, seeing their imposed position as ""someone must pay"" rather than ""those responsible must pay.""

The problem of ""those responsible must pay"" is that someone must decide who is responsible. You seem to have omniscience over who is ""guilty"" and who is ""innocent."" Why have a jury trial at all? We could simply ask you what to do! A great improvement.

&gt;Knowing the people who elected them to be stupid, ignorant, and irresponsible,

Do you have a smarter, more responsible system? Let's hear it. Mostly it sounds to me like, ""prosecutors need to be convinced that someone is guilty and then a jury will hear the case. If the jury gets it 'wrong', we ignore the jury."" 

All in all, this is the problem with believing that guilt and innocence are concepts that exist divorced from the practice of law. OJ isn't a guilty man running free, he's innocent. 

That doesn't mean he didn't commit the actus reus, but it means that there is reasonable doubt that he committed the actus reus while holding the mens rea necessary for the crime. 

Of course, if you have the ability to be both omniscient and a mind-reader, the criminal justice system would seem superfluous.

That being said, Colorado was 100% Putin-style rigged, and there are quite a few other shady things happening at the state convention level within both parties.

&gt; As a candidate, Trump's complaints are laughable. If Trump is so disorganized as a candidate that he can't even assemble the team to master the delegate and convention rules, how is he going to manage to run the massive federal bureaucracy, not to mention to defeat ISIS or build a multibillion dollar wall between the United States and Mexico?

"51563",1460854547,"&gt;1) Trump did not attack all Mexicans;....

I don't think anyone is arguing that he did. I think the bigger issue is that using rhetoric to point out that illegal immigrants have rapists among them (when lets face it, so does every group) implies, and is interpreted, as a criticism of immigration.  He may not have directly stated as much, but it would be stupid to assume that it wouldn't be interpreted as such. 

&gt;2) ... He's a new politician (...) so he shouldn't be criticized more than pro-life Republicans

He absolutely should be criticized more. He is running for president, and is very vocal and, frankly, arrogant in the way he presents his views, which directly correlates to being offensive for the sake of being offensive. 

&gt;4) (Trump flopped on his views to stay on party lines) 

He had a better view, then changed it to one that is less progressive. Of course some people see this as worse, making a bad decision. He deserves any criticism for both backing down on what he stands for (which is his platform ffs) and for moving away from progress

&gt;6) Trump won his votes fair and square. 

I actually haven't seen anyone arguing to the contrary, not sure why you brought it up. It's actually sort of a big part of the problem, though not a problem with him in particular but an issue that speaks about politics in general. 

&gt;8) Trump is more reasonable off camera (doesn't drink alcohol, is more well mannered, etc) 

I think it's right to be concerned about a candidate that is this two faced. Again, not Trump's fault per say, but speaks a lot of a bigger problem (The media circus, the roll money plays in elections, etc) I'm really not sure what drinking has to do with anything, other than I am marginally surprised it doesn't turn republican voters away from him. 



Mostly, and I think it echoes in this sub since it tends to be younger and more liberal, Trump is the embodiment of a lot of things that are wrong with the current political system. He's famous because he's rich, he's supported because he's loud and rich, and even people writing in defense of his policies (like yourself) have to load the article with caveats and are reaching so far that they are forced to make lame comparisons with other candidates (which presents it's own problems since the reason a lot of people like Trump is because he *isn't* like other candidates.) 

He is quintessentially everything this sub is against, being mostly anti progress, money driven, and thriving on the media circus. It's less about his policies or who he is, and more about what he is as an idea. ","Reddit"
"51564",1460854897,"&gt;Here are some of the issues I've had with a small fraction of the things he's said. I would be interested in hearing your views on them.

&gt;On Obama's birth certificate:
It says you have to be born in this country. Essential. Have to be born in this country, okay? If he wasn’t born in this country, he has conned the whole world. [...] I am saying I want to see the birth certificate. It’s very simple. I want to see the birth certificate. How come his own family doesn’t know which hospital he was born in? How come– forget about birth certificates. Let’s say there’s no birth certificate. How come in the hospital itself, okay? This is one of the…in the hospital itself, there’s no records of his birth. In other words, it doesn’t say how much they paid, where is the doctor, here’s your room bill. You know, all the [...] Well, I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they’re talking. Absolutely. And they cannot believe what they’re finding. And I’m serious

&gt;On unemployment:
""The number isn't reflective,"" he said. ""I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent."" He continued, ""5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent.""

&gt;On Foreign policy.
""He said I was in favor in Libya,"" Trump said, sounding perplexed. ""I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gaddafi would be in charge right now.""
""I can’t believe what our country is doing,"" Trump said, according to a BuzzFeed transcript. ""Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage."" [...] ""But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals,"" Trump said. ""It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.""

&gt;On History:
""They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,"" Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. ""And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem.""

&gt;On what he remembers:
""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,"" the Republican presidential candidate said at a Nov. 21 rally in Birmingham, Ala. ""And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.""

&gt;He then claimed
""I have the world's greatest memory.""
He then posted a story from a crippled reporter who he had previously met that actually proved his allegations wrong. When the reporter pointed that out, Trump made fun of him and again claimed to have forgotten who he was.

&gt;On what he's said:
Quick: ""You have talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him (Facebook founder) Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator, because he was in favor of the H-1B visa.""
Trump: ""I never said that. I never said that.""
He did.

&gt;On Bernie Sanders:
""This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton’s) right is giving everything away, so she’s following,"" Trump said on Oct. 14, referring to the Democratic debate the night before. ""He’s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He’s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I’d call him a socialist/communist, okay? ‘Cause that's what he is.""

&gt;On what he hears:
""I don't think the 11 million -- which is a number you have been hearing for many many years, I've been hearing that number for five years -- I don't think that is an accurate number anymore,"" Trump said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 24. ""I am now hearing it's 30 million, it could be 34 million, which is a much bigger problem.""

&gt;On basic finance:
""He raises a million dollars and it costs between $25 million and $50 million, and they close up the entire city of New York,"" Trump said Oct. 13 on Fox News’ Fox and Friends.

&gt;On his poll numbers:
""CNN did a poll recently where President Obama and I are statistically tied,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday morning upon arriving in New Hampshire. ""If you would like, I can send it to you. Call up CNN."" CNN didn't conduct such a survey.

&gt;On the internet:
""We're losing a lot of people because of the internet,"" Trump said. ""We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways. Somebody will say, 'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.""

&gt;On war crimes:
""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said.

&gt;On vaccines:
“I’ve seen it,” he claimed, “a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine… a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.” [...] ""You take this little beautiful baby, and you pump — I mean, it looks like just it's meant for a horse and not for a child,"" Trump said. ""We had so many instances [in which] a child had a vaccine, and came back and a week back had a tremendous fever, got very very sick, and now is autistic.""

"51572",1460860219,"&gt; Trump initially said that he wanted to be neutral between Palestine and Israel. He completely changed his views to mainstream Republican orthodoxy leading up to and including his AIPAC speech. But, his initial common sense views are getting rave reviews when Bernie spoke them at Thursday's debate. Therefore, Trump deserves some credit for seeing the issue clearly.

I'd argue if he moved from the right position to the wrong one that it's completely the opposite of seeing things clearly. I know what you were trying to say, that he was somehow forced to do that to appease republicans even though he's been winning the nom so far since the very first votes and didn't need to appease AIPAC at that point. Bernie on the other hand stuck with his principles on it and has continued to do so even if it might alienate a sector of voters that disagree with him.

But while they do have freedom of speech, other people are free to think they're wrong - the government isn't censoring them, and the backlash isn't a violation of their freedom of speech. Similarly, while Clinton has a right to the privacy of her transcripts (probably - it may be that Goldman Sachs also has the right to release them, I'm not sure), people have a right to not vote for her because of them.

She is within her privacy rights to withhold the contents as she wishes, no court is proposing to compel her to release this information. She was also within her rights to stipulate contract terms that did not allow anyone else to retain or distribute transcripts or recordings of her speeches. As a politician and diplomat, words are the tools of her trade, so how she uses them is indicative of her approach to her profession. Voters have the right to say that they won't vote for her if she chooses not to be transparent on this issue. 

Other candidates are unambiguous on their stances towards big finance (with the exception of Mr. Trump, who is ambiguous on most policy topics). Her only opponent for the Democratic Nomination is a public servant who can't give those kinds of speeches for money by law, as are two of her three potential Republican rivals.

Apparently that is not going to be before people vote if the Clinton Campaign has their way, and they will move the goalposts as many times as they have to in order to delay. How is Clinton in a stronger position to demand further disclosures from anybody by insisting that she should not have to release transcripts that everyone knows that she had specially made as part of her standard speaking contract? What are they being saved for, some shelf in her future Presidential Library?

Nothing in Senator Sanders' tax returns is going to tell us more about the truth of his stated intention to regulate large financial institutions that present a systemic risk to the US and global economies. His actual statements and votes on the subject are a matter of public record and show remarkable consistency for over 25 years of elected service. The very fact that Secretary Clinton would rather not show these transcripts to the voting public, instead of being proud of their contents, speaks volumes as to how their contents would be viewed by the Democratic Primary electorate if not the general electorate as a whole.","Reddit"

I'd argue that a great solution is through education and economic opportunity.  The reason we don't have the same radicalization of muslim youth in the U.S. is precisely because we encourage integration and participation.  The Europeans have been much harsher, with laws banning the hijab and niqab in places like Belgium and France.  

I work with refugees and immigrants and what they want is to participate.  Sure, the older folks who come over stick to their ways, but the younger refugees and the children are very open to the american way of life.  The woman start driving and are less covered (sometimes not covered at all).  

Criminalizing Islam has the opposite of the desired effect.  It ghettoizes muslims and radicalizes people.  Their religion is oppressed.  We are not perfect, but our Bill of Rights has protections that Europeans don't.  It goes both ways.  By being open to muslims coming here, they are more open to us.  I see it every day.

If we are to encourage reform we need to push for measures that increase education and economic opportunity both in the West and the muslim world.  We also need to be open and tolerant to all religious beliefs.  Tolerance is wonderfully disarming.  ","Reddit"

"52740",1460932191,"The one major ignorance about Bernie's $15 dollar minimum wage is to failure to understand about cost of living costs in different communities and employer's ability to maintain that wage in a particular locality. $15 an hour minimum wage in a high-cost area where people have lots of disposible income is absolutely necessary just to get by without living on a stream.  However, in an area of rural Texas or Nebraska, the area just does not have enough high-paying jobs to sustain the increase in prices that it would take the business to cover the wage.  In addition, the living costs could be way cheaper allowing a person to survive on a lower wage than in Los Angeles or Seattle.  

The federal government pays its workers based on locality.  The most expensive areas have the highest wages while areas with lower wages have lower of cost of living.  Aka: that is minimum wage should be.  I think Hillary being a former cabinet member understand this very well.

African press reports specifically mention that he was beaten due to a “Forbes article written by Richard Miniter.” The attack took place after Zoe Kabila and Kabila’s twin sister, Jaynet Kyungu, accused Evariste Boshab of having been an anonymous source for my article in Forbes. President Kabila was reportedly present during the abusive interrogation, which apparently took place on a farm he owns near Kinshasa. Afroamerica News describes its source for the beating story as an unnamed “official close to Rwandan President Paul Kagame.” For the record, the parliament speaker was not my source for that article nor is he among the sources for this one. This beating is just one more alleged injustice of the Kabila regime.

&gt; Six years ago Thursday, the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United transformed our politics by allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections.

&gt; The effect was immediate. In the 2010 midterms, outside groups spent nearly 60% more than in 2006. In 2014, the top 100 donors spent nearly as much as all 4.75 million small donors combined. National networks of big-money donors funneled mountains of cash into targeted state races. By 2014, one party controlled both the governor’s mansion and the state legislature in 36 states — the most since the 1950s.

&gt; Meanwhile, Republicans launched an aggressive campaign to restrict voting rights across the country. …

&gt; **Public housing residents** in New York are forced to live with leaky roofs, mold, unreliable heating systems, broken elevators and vermin. The authority provides housing for some 400,000 New Yorkers, but there is a $17 billion backlog in unmet capital needs.

PSA: Affordable Housing != Public Housing

Politicians have been conflating the two. That's not good for people who live in public housing.

Sanders public housing plan is a single line tucked into his much longer [Affordable Housing Plan](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-for-affordable-housing/), which is linked from OP's press release:

&gt; **Repair Public Housing.** We need sufficient funding for public housing operating and capital costs, and we need to reduce the unacceptable backlog of public housing capital needs.

[That's it](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-for-affordable-housing/).

Lawrence O'donnell has been talking about it all week, and he's right. **Neither of these Democratic candidates** have put forward good enough plans to help address the $17B in repairs needed for NYCHA residents... *who outnumber the entire population of Vermont...* And that's just public housing residents in New York City alone.

Both candidates talk a big game on affordable housing, but it's *not the same* as public housing. Affordable housing is a middle class issue. Public housing is different and should get specific, national visibility.

It's disgraceful how nobody is actually putting forward substantive policies that address the most basic housing needs of people who live in public housing.

"53186",1460922547,"Gather round children and I'll tell you a tale, about how our political system came to be...

When designing our electoral system the founders instituted a simple first-past-the-post system that had been the standard in most western democracies since the Athenians. Parties emerged, and every generation or so one party would get too out of touch and a new party would replace them. The Democrat-Republicans replaced the Federalists, the Democrats and the Whigs replaced the Democrat-Republicans (truly beginning the two party system) and the Whigs were replaced by the Republicans. Then in 1912 Theodore Roosevelt tried to do this again by running under the Bull Moose Progressive Party, but something different happened this time. Rather than grow into their own party, the progressive Republicans who joined TR in 1912 jumped ship for the Democrats. Both parties were now much more powerful than their predecessors had been, thanks to the increased cost of running a national campaign, and it became harder to simply unseat one with a newer agenda. Another interesting change began at the turn of the 20th century: Political Primaries started to be adopted. Only about a dozen states ever used them to assign delegates, and both parties still preferred to nominate at a national convention, but the progressive era was beginning to lay the groundwork for a more involved body politic than in previous generations, and a greater scrutiny towards political elites/party bosses. Successive elections like 1924, 1948 and 1960 would see progressives leave the Republican party and racists leave the Democratic party, leaving the Democrats with smaller conservative wings and Republicans with smaller Liberal wings.

Then came 1968, [the last election until 2008 that would see voter turnout break 60%](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voter_turnout.png) and in that election we saw a paradigm shift in political culture. This would be the election that purged the last elements of the ""Dixiecrats"" (racist southern Democrats) from the Democratic party and set the stage for the rise of national primaries. For the Republicans, the primary contest was a close race between Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon (Reagan narrowly won the primary contest), but Nixon won the national convention handily... for the Democrats it was a very different story. Hubert Humphrey, as Johnson's VP, had to run in support of the Vietnam war, with college students and African American democrats hated, and they voted in the primaries overwhelmingly in opposition to Humphrey. 69% of primary voters voted for either Bobby Kennedy or Gene McCarthy, and most Kennedy supporters believed McCarthy would be their guy after Kennedy was assassinated. With only 2.21% of primary voters supporting him, McCarthy still received the Democratic party nomination. The result was a close race in terms of the popular vote, but one where Richard Nixon swept 32 states and 301 electoral votes. The Democrats blamed their loss on Humphrey (and the party nominating system) failing to engage minorities, women, and the youth. So in 1969 the McGovern–Fraser Commission adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for the aforementioned voters, leading to most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections.

And this is where things start to fall apart. The primary process (also adopted by the Republicans, much for the same reasons outlined in the McGovern–Fraser Commission) resulted in the parties seeking ideological purity over electability and a desire to govern. At first the system was just chaotic, with no clear consensus candidates between 1972 and 1980 for the Democrats, and primary challengers for both parties in 1976 and 1980. Ronald Reagan was really the first candidate to use the primary process to his advantage by building a coalition from within his party rather than the traditional process of parties building coalitions among demographic interests. And there's the problem: primary voters are party loyalists often more interested in ideological purity than electability or the ability to govern. And if all you have to do to win the election is appeal to the party ideology, guess what? The more moderate members will start to leave and not vote in the general. This is what led to the low turnouts of the late 20th Century and early 2000s. Also, primaries made elections longer and more expensive, not just for Presidential campaigns, but for House and Senate elections as well. Politicians had to simultaneously appeal to the worst elements within their party and interest groups who now could directly influence politicians rather than negotiate with party leaders. So parties got more radical and voters less interested. Things changed under the Bush administration as the country's disgust with his policies led to the Democratic ""Big Tent"" (that pushed the party more to the middle), but the radicalization in the primary process continued (it just got a reprieve in the Democratic party), and that's how we wound up with the current crop of Republican nut bags, and one very liberal independent and one center-left (by American Standards) Democratic candidates.

This Fox TV thing is a *very*  pro-Sanders article - so why does the Reddit Headline above intentionally miss that?

Is Sanders so upset with that statement?  That he has to hide it on Reddit? Then he's **really** not going to like this one, is he:

&gt;What Clooney pointed to is that Clinton has been bringing in millions of dollars, not just for her campaign, but also for Democrats running in House, Senate and other local races.

&gt;""It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress,"" Clooney said on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday. ""And the reason that's important, and the reason it's important to me, is because we need — I'm a Democrat. So if you're a Republican, you're going to disagree, but we need to take the Senate back.""

http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474585666/george-clooney-on-a-big-money-difference-between-clinton-and-sanders

The the headline above manages to miss the first major point **even though it is central to Bernies campaign!**

Why?  Why throw the major point out?  Huh? Possibly because no one would pay attention if the actual (Fox) headline was used?

But since it mentions this indirectly, it is time that we look at it.  The problem is two fold.

1.  Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will be carpet bombed by Adelson, Pope, the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Bush Rangers. Ad Sanders is not equipped to deal with that. And rejecting the strongest statement Clooney made about it just makes Sanders  worse off. 

2.  What Clooney ALSO Said: Democrat Congressional campaigns also need money  and Bernie Sanders has no clue how to handle this. 

The entire attempt to get rid of Citizens United requires a team. Otherwise it would  end in a fiasco if there is no money for Congressional campaigns and apparently Bernie Sanders has no plans.

Could we possibly consider what the article actually is instead of pretending that this is something written by George Clooney and that its accurate.  

It is neither.   There is much truth to what he says but that is only PARTLY considered by the headline and since people ""Vote up"" these headlines without every discussing the or finding out that they aren't complete, they become lies created for the benefit of Fox News or some other source where A) it gets to USE Reddit to post its headlines for free or B) someone USES the people in the article for their own purpose.

"53375",1460921944,"One of the primary issues with this topic is that anyone who even thinks to question the narrative of climate change becomes labeled as a ""climate denier"". Many folks here seem to be under the delusion that someone who is a climate denier is denying that the Earth goes through climate shifts. That is not the case at all. 

I myself am what most of you would call a ""climate denier"", but not because I don't believe in the effects of climate change. Quite the contrary. I live in Alaska. I have seen first hand the effects of climate change. When I was growing up we never used to have thunder storms in the summer, and now we get them every year. In my life time I have seen the reduction of one of our glaciers. The question with all of this change is not whether or not it is happening, buy WHY it is happening. I question the narrative that humans are causing climate change because in all the research presented, and in all the documentation I have seen, I have never seen anyone substantially account for the fact that we are living next to a giant ball of plasma that has its own shifts in climate over time. We have seen the history of the Earth in the rock sediment. We have an accurate history of the Earth going through heating and cooling cycles long before humans ever even arrived on the scene, let alone began using fossil fuels.

Denying someone their first amendment rights because they dare to say that humans are not the cause of climate change, and that the Sun is the likely culprit, is no different than when Galileo was put under house arrest for daring to suggest that humanity was not the center of the Universe and that the Earth might actually orbit the Sun. 

But of course I will likely receive several comments along the lines of ""he has fewer brain cells, so his opinions are invalid"", or ""don't listen to him, he doesn't believe in science"". If daring to have an opinion in 2016 is considered an act warranting damnation, then perhaps we have come full circle back to when the church was dictating every facet of reality. People who questioned the church hundreds of years ago were called ""blasphemers"", now it seems we are called ""deniers"", and to much the same effects. ","Reddit"

If you have a problem with this, you have a problem with the party system. This is all in place so they can exercise control over their platform and how they allocate the party's money. It's their money and infrastructure, not party outsiders and certainly not yours anymore if you handed it over.

This election is special in that we have not one but two candidates that are usurping the notoriety, infrastructure and money of the two dominate parties. If anything, I think that's what is unseemly here. There's something pretty disingenuous and manipulative about using the resources of a group that you openly say you have little in common with and have demonstrably acted in ways at odds with what they are. And if you're a candidate so dumb that you never actually paid attention to ""your"" party's platform and rules, then you probably deserve what you get.

Even 2 years ago, he would have been a RINO or at least I would assume that because Boehner was called a RINO and he was far more conservative than Trump. Is appealing to fear that much more important to core values? Admittedly, I don't understand how Trump became the face of ""conservative values"".

Moving on...now when it comes to Cruz, he is hated by his peers because he is too extreme. The idea that the party would rally behind him, especially after their ""autopsy report"" is baffling. The fact that he is the solution to Trump hijacking the party, I guess I will never understand. 

As a Dem, especially  considering it is natural for things to shift parties after 8 years of one party having the top job, I am very worried were things go. Trump is a wild card, my biggest worry is he will want people to like him and he says he will pick judges based on the Heritage Foundation.

This is Uber being misleading (no surprise there).

When companies like Reddit, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and basically everyone else except Uber release a transparency report they are reporting on data that was requested by law enforcement or agencies involved in national security. In other words, subpoenas, warrants, and so on.

Uber received ~400 of those kind of requests for user data, and ~200 for driver data.

Uber's transparency report includes that, plus a bunch of other data they have to give to various government agencies that has nothing to do with crime or law enforcement or national security.

For instance, legal, licensed transportation companies in California are required to provide certain rider data to the California Public Utilities Commission so that the PUC can determine whether or not the company is serving all kinds of passengers in any neighborhood or are discriminating against minorities or disabled people and things like that. In other words the kind of stuff that PUC, as the body that regulates these companies in California, needs to actually regulate them.

As part of a deal with the PUC to not be shut down in California for operating an illegal, unlicensed taxi service Uber agreed to also provide this data. (And then they tried to renege on their agreement, were fined $7.6 million dollars, and then provided the data).","Reddit"

Most of the volunteers there (including Gary Floyd from the band The Dicks) were gay, despite it being a Catholic charity. If they had room, you had a safe place to sleep, food, and a shower. They'd hook you up with basic toiletries and clothes and stuff. They'd also counsel you if you needed/wanted it - I still remember a woman named Autumn and wish I knew where she was now so I could tell her I survived and grew up to be a productive member of society. :D There was no religion brought into it at all, just a bunch of people trying to help kids and keep them safe (sometimes from themselves).

Her claim that most traced guns used in crimes were from out-of-state is [true](https://www.atf.gov/about/docs/report/new-york-firearms-trace-data-%E2%80%93-2014/download) (just 1,397 guns out of 4,585 traced guns had their point-of-origin in NY state)... provided that you're willing to assume that the untraceable guns follow the same state-of-origin trends that the traceable guns follow (I happen to think that's a reasonable assumption, personally).

The claim of guns used in 'violent crimes' is murkier, because that data isn't in the [ATF pack](https://www.atf.gov/about/docs/report/new-york-firearms-trace-data-%E2%80%93-2014/download) where all these talking points came from.

In New York city, the cost is over $400 before you even get to purchase a hand gun (far more often used in gun violence than shotguns and rifles). 

This whole thing should be revealing that the true issue is that each state having different legislation when it comes to legal ownership of guns, in a world where people have, you know, cars, means that people who really want a gun can generally ignore how difficult it might be to do so in their own state. Federal requirements and regulations that each state has to follow at minimum would be far more useful, but all Hillary can talk about is a bogus statistic about guns from Vermont.","Reddit"

Think about this while you're crying about these obviously rigged elections. The Clinton Foundation took 10's of millions from Saudi royals. Hillary Clinton turned around and sold them [$29bill in weapons as Secretary of State](http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187). The Saudis [murdered 24 children](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/22/families-were-blown-up-scenes-from-a-saudi-led-bombing-in-yemen/) last month with weapons sold to them through 'your' government. Nobody on Reddit gives a damn about this at all. They all keep chirping about delegate math and voting machines like this election was ever real to begin with.

How is it that there is no law that says politicians can't take money from people associated with countries that are clearly human rights abusers? How is it legal for Clinton to push through these weapons sales as Secretary of State after they gave their family foundation millions? How is there no accountability when the result is dead kids' bodies strewn out across a marketplace? Well look in the mirror cause you are the problem. You don't understand a damn thing and certainly don't give one shit about those people that were slaughtered. You sit on your fluffy ass and talk about delegate math and bs in the NY Times about voting machines.  In four years you'll get behind the next 'opposition' movement and fall for the same bullshit all over again. Maybe if you clowns didn't fall for this same thing every four years those kids would still be alive.  But sadly, you're all fake, good for nothing pieces of shit.

We need a member of congress to stand up for us and propose a law that says all leaders in the US are banned from taking money from people associated with human rights violating regimes. Period. If a leader takes money from a human rights violating regime and then sells them weapons then they will be charged with treason. Full stop.

I mean, what do you think the penalty is for treason in a place like North Korea or Saudi Arabia? Probably a lot worse than whatever that penalty is here. They'd get off easy no?

The original version still concedes that temperatures are rising.  

Here's what I'd indicate if you honestly don't buy into global warming.  Let's accept that the atmosphere is huge, and it is difficult to believe that human factors can influence it.  Think of it this way instead.  Think about how large your own body is.  Think about taking a pill for something (let's say a headache).  The pill is sooo small relative to your body size.  And yet, it affects your body pretty significantly.  

The same is true about global warming gases.  While it is true that the Earth's atmosphere is very large, it is also true that all that has to happen for us to affect the atmosphere is throw up a couple parts per million of carbon dioxide into it.  We've been doing that for at least the last 100+ years, and it is just staying there.  

Whether this article is true is irrelevant, since it concedes that temperatures are rising.  Whether we like it or not, we need to do something about it...going back to the analogy, it is basically a poison pill we've all collectively ingested.

&gt;The problem with this new wrinkle in Hillary Clinton's K-12 education agenda is the assertion that the federal government is to blame for over-testing. Nothing could be further from the truth. On average, federal policies account for seven hours of testing per year – roughly 0.6 percent of an average school year. The time students spend on assessments required by states and school districts is, on average, two to three times that required by the federal government.

","Reddit"
"57982",1460928574,"&gt; While Clinton offered no substantial policy solutions during the portions of the interview concerning education, she at least underlined one indisputable fact: She knows more about K–12 education than any other candidate remaining in either party’s race. In a way that’s not saying much. Jeb Bush had clearer solutions, spelled out in detail, in his platform. Maybe they wouldn’t have worked, but at least they were there. Since his departure from the race, education journalists have had to make do with the candidates’ offhand education comments.

That's the first part.

&gt;His promise to tax ""Wall Street speculators"" as social restitution for the taxpayer-funded bailout of 2008 is misguided at best. This tax targets helpful market activity that had nothing to do with the risky subprime mortgage loans that prompted the bailout. 

We don't know why it's misguided though; and frankly, Wall Street speculation makes a fuckton of money. It's a good place to think about a revenue stream and may even reign in some risky behavior that does have a negative impact on the markets (from what little I know &amp; have read). 

&gt;A link on Sanders' website explaining how the tax ""would generate about $300 billion in revenue,"" leads only to a memo by Robert Pollin and James Heintz of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. That document begins ""we emphasize that our conclusions are not based on anything close to the type of solid foundation in research and evidence that one would normally expect in considering such an important question.""

**This could be very problematic EXCEPT** when I go to Sander's website, [this](http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_401-450/WP414.pdf) is the link I get, which is NOT from what the article links to. For the record, this is the article that the article goes to, NOT the one that Sanders' website goes to: http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/ftt/Pollin--Heintz--Memo_on_FTT_Rates_and_Revenue_Potential_w_references----6-9-12.pdf
