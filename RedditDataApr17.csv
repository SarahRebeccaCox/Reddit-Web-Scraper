"24","1460893255","Populism and anti-establishment feeling has sprung up across the world. 

See success of the Five Star movement in Italy, the election of Syriza in Greece and to a lesser extent the resurgence of the Front National in France and the presence of UKIP in the UK.

At some stage in the last half a decade the trust that people have in both politicians and the political process has dropped off a cliff. 

Now, in continental Europe, proportional voting systems mean that dissatisfaction is very easy to express and alternative parties can spring up, and get a foothold, in a matter of years or even months.

In the US things are different.

The first past the post voting system means that change is both difficult and slow. The quickest way to effect change is from within the existing party structure of the dominant parties the Republicans and the Democrats.

In the case of the Democrats Sanders had a slow start but has gained quickly as he established himself and his platform as an alternative candidate. His lack of name-recognition meant that he was always going to start on the back-foot against the well-known Hillary Clinton. It makes sense that he has picked up as time has gone-on but it looks like it may well be too late. 

The Republicans situation is almost the opposite. The insurgent candidate is immensely well known and has been for decades. This meant that he started on the front-foot. Trump has also benefited from a very split field. While the majority of votes cast have been for non-Trump candidates he was polling higher than any other perspective nominee. And in the winner-takes all states it meant that he mopped up.

We should also bear in mind that this is not the general election. The people voting in Primaries are self-selecting and represent a tiny-fraction of the electorate. And both the insurgent Republican and Democratic candidates are immensely unpopular with huge swathes of voters who identify as the opposite Party. 

Come the general it could be that the prevailing forces of conservatism favour an establishment candidate. 

Populism is a double-edged sword in this race. It can win you the nomination but lose you the general election. "

The poll was conducted by telephone with live interviewers April 11-13, 2016 among a random national sample of 1,021 registered voters (RV).  Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

Take a look at the most recent revolutions occurring across the world. They have more often than not created massive instability for in some cases decades. More often than not, they lead to further central authority, less freedom and a situation that was much worse than it was before.

You all rant and rave about corporations supposedly stripping you of your rights, yet you do not even take a moment to think about what your movement would create. Undoubtedly, it would lead to handing political power to the hands of a few. You would be trading what is in reality minimal corporate overreach for something remarkably worse.

It could be, for example, that Cruz and Trump would make things worse than her - making her the favourable candidate in that instance. Or, perhaps, that Sanders would improve relations compared to her - in which case he would be favourable.

"164","1460911392","In terms of foreign policy, I think Hillary Clinton will be the best out there.   I will tell you why.  For years, I leaned somewhat towards the isolationist policy similar to that of Ron Paul, and perhaps Bernie Sanders too.  But from what I have seen in the last 8 years, I concluded that this isolationistic view was naive.  If the USA completely withdraws from intervention everywhere in the world, it will have a great impact on the US economy.  Gasoline will be $7/gallon.  Travel will be much more expensive.  Things will be much more costly.  I don't think Americans can deal with this.  But once you intervene, it's very hard not to be aggressive.  Look at Russia, China, Iran, etc.  Whenever they sense weakness from the US, they make a move.  China in Southeast Asia. Russia in the Middle East.  It's like football, if you don't watch, they gain a few yards.  So, the reality is you have to keep these guys in check.  What makes things complicated is that with China in particular, you also do business with them.  So, it requires a very sophisticated leader who is willing to participate in diplomacy as well as is prepared to be strong if necessary.  This is why I think Clinton is the great fit for this role at this time.  I don't think she's as hawkish as these guys portrayed her.  Don't forget she championed the ""reset"" with Russia.  It was successful for a while, when she was in office.  I think Clinton possesses a balanced understanding of diplomacy and military engagement that is better than anyone else in this race.

&gt;
&gt;Give Students the Same Low Interest Rates as Big Banks (78%)
&gt;
&gt;Universal Pre-Kindergarten (77%)
&gt;

&gt;

This all equates to me one thing. Higher taxes. People need to pay higher taxes. Not just the rich, although they need to pay more proportionally. Americans today are selfish assholes who can't equate this fact. You've been thought to think that you can have this and still not pay higher taxes. You cannot. 

You need to ask yourself: What is more important to you? 35% tax rates or all these programs. That is really what it comes down to. 

Even Sanders is guilty of pulling this trick on you. Thinking that you can have it both. Although, granted, he's been mentioning it briefly at times. Hillary and the others have understood though. That you all actually want both. So they are forced to find a middle ground. Promising social programs and only manage to deliver some that is good enough for the general public. While doing tax breaks at the same time. That is a recipe for disaster. And you are to blame for it when you ask for both extended social programs and tax breaks. "

Here's the thing, though. If you're a senator and you plan to work until you die (which Bernie clearly intends to do; he's 74 years old, is running for PotUS and is one of the most passionate people in Washington)... why the fuck do you need to save for retirement?

That's money that you will never ever see or use.

Americans are obsessed with hoarding money. If you have a job you don't plan to continue performing after 60, then that's fine. You need to have a nice piggy bank saved up. But there are plenty of valid ways to handle your retirement. Continuing to work if you are able to do so is one of them. Why stash away money you will get 0% use out of? Couple this with the fact that senators receive a pension after retirement that averages around $40-70k a year (based on years of service and whether they're in CSRS or FERS plan), and this becomes a pretty silly point to even bring up.

"366","1460862722","I'm not a Hillary supporter, but I don't really understand the drive to get the transcripts released.

Do I think it's a definite gray area of conflict of interest? Certainly. Although I don't think $200K is that much to someone like Hillary, it's still dodgy to take money from an industry that has too much influence already.

But do I think the speeches themselves contain a bunch of smoking gun gotchas? No way. I've been to events like this, and most likely if people did get their hands on the transcripts, they'd be bored out of their skulls reading them. The least boring scenario is that Hillary actually said something substantive, and you get an idea of her philosophy on how to change / govern the world. But it's not going to be stuff like, ""Make sure I get elected, and I'll make sure your industry is allowed to operate how it wants.""

Even if there *is* such an arrangement, that's a back room deal, not something she is announcing to the rank and file employees of a big company. First of all, that's not how these things are done, and second, in case you hadn't noticed, Hillary pays a *lot* of attention to what information gets into whose hands (hence the private email servers).

Of course, I'm lying a bit here. I actually do understand the drive to get transcripts released.

Why do I think Hillary isn't releasing the transcripts? Honestly, she probably did say something that is totally reasonable but wouldn't go over well in the Democratic primary.

But do I think the speeches themselves contain a bunch of smoking gun gotchas? No way. I've been to events like this, and most likely if people did get their hands on the transcripts, they'd be bored out of their skulls reading them. The least boring scenario is that Hillary actually said something substantive, and you get an idea of her philosophy on how to change / govern the world.

Even if there *is* such an arrangement, that's a back room deal, not something she is announcing to the rank and file employees of a big company. First of all, that's not how these things are done, and second, in case you hadn't noticed, Hillary pays a *lot* of attention to what information gets into whose hands (hence the private email servers).

Of course, I'm lying a bit here. I actually do understand the drive to get transcripts released.

"436","1460911872","**Bob Graham and the Missing 9/11 Report Pages**

Posted on May 12, **2015**	by Kevin Ryan

The media has taken an increasing interest in the 28 pages that were redacted from the 9/11 Joint Congressional Inquiry Report. The stories usually feature one of the Inquiry’s leaders, former Senator Bob Graham, who has claimed that the missing pages point to involvement of the government of Saudi Arabia. Although Saudi complicity is in no way surprising, facts that are often overlooked suggest that Graham’s actions may not be entirely straightforward. This leads independent researchers to raise concerns about his intentions and those concerns are justified.

To begin with, Graham never calls for release of other documents collected by the government’s 9/11 investigators, most of which are still held secret. That includes the majority of 9/11 Commission documents, of which only a fraction have been released—with much of the content redacted. The release of Commission documents is hindered by claims that they are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because they are congressional records. Nonetheless, the public deserves to see documents that might answer critical questions.

Here is some info I posted before on some of the shadiness from the last Clinton presidency:

If they do go back, and I hope they don't, let's ensure they understand what is to stay in the house when they depart this time.

[""After they were criticized for taking $190,000 worth of china, flatware, rugs, televisions, sofas and other gifts with them when they left, the Clintons announced last week that they would pay for $86,000 worth of gifts, or nearly half the amount.""](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121856&amp;amp;page=1)

Also:
""Lawmakers are questioning Clinton’s desire to rent expensive office space in New York City at government expense. Because of the contention, the former president’s foundation has offered to pay at least $300,000 of an estimated $790,000 annual rent for the office Clinton favors.
**Mrs. Clinton, the new senator from New York, has faced questions about the propriety of accepting the gifts in the period between her election and her swearing-in.** Senate rules would have limited what she could accept had she been a senator.
Members of both parties also have criticized Clinton for granting scores of eleventh-hour clemency requests, including the pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive in Switzerland from 51 counts in the United States of tax evasion and fraud.""

Are you sure you want these people back in office? Seriously.

Edit: what do ya know, Marc Rich was a hedge fund manager. Check this out: 

""Marc Rich (born Marcell David Reich; December 18, 1934 – June 26, 2013) was an **international commodities trader, hedge fund manager, financier and businessman**. He was best known for founding the commodities company Glencore and for being indicted in the United States on **federal charges of tax evasion and illegally making oil deals with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis**. He was in Switzerland at the time of the indictment and never returned to the United States.  **He received a controversial presidential pardon from U.S. President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, Clinton's last day in office.**""

1.  Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will be carpet bombed by Adelson, Pope, the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Bush Rangers. Sanders is not equipped to deal with it. And rejecting Clooney just makes him worse off. 

2.  Democrat Congressional campaigns also need money  and Bernie Sanders has no clue how to handle this.

Wealthier citizens live longer than poor ones. In some parts of the US, wealthier citizens live on average 13 years longer than poor citizen.

In this article it claims that this would transform social security from an insurance program into a welfare program that explicitly transfers wealth from the rich to the poor.

Removing the contribution cap on social security while leaving the annual benefits cap in place is the only plausible measure to correct for the difference in years in which the wealthiest can expect to benefit from their insurance investment.

Every measure to ""improve"" social security that proposes raising the retirement age explicitly transfers wealth from poor to rich. Every measure that proposes throwing social security onto the private markets subjects the poorest citizens to the whims of short terms profits not the guaranteed minimum security that a lifetime of honest work should have earned."

In many ways Clinton is a fox, she is carefully analyzing every facet of an argument, but her concern is not the argument's validity, but how it will be perceived by the public.

We're really not as dependent on Middle Eastern Oil as we used to be and that just becomes more and more true every year. 

Honestly, just look at the Data from 2009 through today.. You'll see it starting to take a big fuckin' nose dive.

http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec3_8.pdf

OPEC Imports aren't what makes up a majority of our Oil anymore and now that Sanctions have been lifted on Iran they've had a direct influence on Saudi Arabia's (used to be cornered) Market and now Saudi Arabia's hurting. 

Honestly in a lot of ways (this is speculation though so take it with a grain of salt) this is probably why we tried so hard to get this Nuclear Deal passed with Iran, to try and squeeze Saudi Arabia as much as we could after all these years. 

Edit: 

One thing I forgot to mention.. I'm not sure what the Imports look like for OTHER countries though. I mean I know Saudi Arabia is still an Oil Powerhouse but they're not ""the powerhouse"" anymore and just to reiterate, my source for their financial troubles is the IMF which should also be taken with a grain of salt.

[Here's a photo](http://imgur.com/wxZ3Q9K) I took from the sit-in on the steps.  You can see the rally on the other side of the police line.  For the most part the Capitol city police were friendly.  I spent some time during processing talking to one of them about the Warriors for a while.

Here are a couple of short videos of the event: [one from the march](https://vid.me/vFFE) as we reached the Capitol and [one from the steps](https://vid.me/bjQA) right as we were about to begin the sit-in.

There was a 3 hour training session for those participating in the sit-in so many of us were well prepared and well informed.  Many people had participated in the arrests throughout the week and others had lots of experience in protests in years past.  The organization takes nonviolent direct action very seriously.  Members include Noam Chomsky and Lawrence Lessig as well as celebrities like Mark Ruffalo.

Those who chose to sit-in on the steps of the Capitol in violation of the law and be arrested were also fined $50, resulting in $45,000+ in fines.  Some people did go to jail and others were processed on-site (see details in comments below).  Those who chose not to sit-in (the majority) protested in the ""designated"" protest area.

The protests earlier in the week had coverage by better news organizations:

* Sanders doesn't talk too much about himself personally as do other candidates

&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke in unusually personal terms Saturday night about how his fight for the poor has been spurred by his own childhood, saying that there was “constant tension” between his parents over money.

* Father came from Poland and was satisfied with humble life he had as paint salesman. His mother was born and raised in the U.S. and had bigger dreams of wanting their own house. This would create tensions. 

&gt;That was a dream,” he said. “She died at the age of 46. She never achieved that dream.”

* Doesn't like shopping after his experience of having his mother take him to 15+ stores to find the cheapest leather jacket. 

* Hillary Clinton  did a fundraising in California that costed $33K per person. Before that, she listened to five black mothers whose children died to gun violence. 

&gt;“She took notes…Her staff didn’t take the notes. She took the notes. She followed up,” Ms. Carr (Mother of Eric Garner) said. “I do endorse her, but she endorsed us first.”

This election cycle has been completely focused on domestic issues. Personally, I'm ok with Hillary's approach to some of these issues. I like Bernie's approach to several of these as well. However, with foreign policy considered, I just can't vote for Clinton. Even in the last debate, she made a point that she recommended that Obama arm Syrians to fight the regime there.

I understand a lot of people have invested a lot of time and energy into his campaign, but if he wins, it seems counter productive to either write in or vote Green.  For starters if you write in Bernie it just won't be counted at all.  I can understand trying to send a message to the DNC, but if Hillary does win with more votes and pledged delegates, what message is that supposed to be exactly?  That the wishes of the majority are not what matter?  That doesn't sound like a very good message to me.

On the other hand, voting third party does sound possible, but has protest votes ever really worked at any time in the past?  It surely didn't work in 2000, and it didn't do any good for the reform party.  Secondly, and this is the big thing, there is a lot at stake this election.  Millions of more people have access to healthcare through insurance now, and the two most likely candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, want to undo the act that gave those people that healthcare.  If you don't have a lot to lose by having a republican as the next president, it may not sound like a bad idea to take a protest vote, but for a lot of people, they have their healthcare/health insurance on the line.  I can't in good conscious vote for someone who does not have a chance to win in the general election, when my vote could be going to someone who does actually have a chance to win.  I don't even need to mention supreme court justices (we are very close to having the first majority progressive court in a long while).  

This is just my opinion on the matter, but I really hope those who are considering Bernieorbust, consider what this election does mean to a lot of people.  "

Let me tell yeah, if you wanted real progressive change than this is the exact opposite way to do it. And I mean the presidency. See despite what will inevitably get linked, /r/GrassrootsSelect is not enough as it currently stands. If you want an end to the war on drugs you'd vote for judges, sheriffs, and DA's who end them in your state and community and who could lobby your state government to do that. If you wanted free healthcare and college, an end to private prisons, stricter gun regulations, an end to faith based teachings in schools, protections towards minorities and women, and other progressive goals then you'd vote for State senators, representatives, attorneys generals, governors, town councilmen, mayors, school board members, and many other positions to enact political change. But you don't. Bernie or Bust folks have little patience for the tedium of state and local politics. 

You and your fellow compatriots really don't care about progressivism or liberalism because if you did you'd recognize what it takes to get that change done. You'd vote for a libertarian, or trump, or a tea partier just to give a finger to Clinton. This just shows that you are politically immature and these asinine ramblings will be over once June 7th rolls around. See Clinton supporters said the same thing back in 2008.

Instead, you can post a bunch of garbage from Huffpost, Vox, Salon, and lately even the National Enquirer if it fits one of the above mentioned categories. This subreddit really shouldn't complain about bias because they are arguably more guilty than any news source of bias. CNN or Fox or MSNBC. Yeah you can say that each have their biases, but they at least let their opponents talk from time to time.

Don't take inspiration from Trudeau. The only reason he looks good is because the guy before him was Canada's Bush.

I should add, a much more apt contemporary example is [Jeremy Corbyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn), the uncompromising leader of the UK Labour Party.

Let me tell yeah, if you wanted real progressive change than this is the exact opposite way to do it. And I mean the presidency. See despite what will inevitably get linked, /r/GrassrootsSelect is not enough as it currently stands. If you want an end to the war on drugs you'd vote for judges, sheriffs, and DA's who end them in your state and community and who could lobby your state government to do that. If you wanted free healthcare and college, an end to private prisons, stricter gun regulations, an end to faith based teachings in schools, protections towards minorities and women, and other progressive goals then you'd vote for State senators, representatives, attorneys generals, governors, town councilmen, mayors, school board members, and many other positions to enact political change. But you don't. Bernie or Bust folks have little patience for the tedium of state and local politics. 

You and your fellow compatriots really don't care about progressivism or liberalism because if you did you'd recognize what it takes to get that change done. You'd vote for a libertarian, or trump, or a tea partier just to give a finger to Clinton. This just shows that you are politically immature and these asinine ramblings will be over once June 7th rolls around. See Clinton supporters said the same thing back in 2008. And look how that turned out.

My real question is, I wonder who the hip young people choice will be in 2024?"

"809","1460843523","These are all fair points but I simply don't understand why more isn't being made of Clinton's foreign policy history. Under her (and Obama), the US has continued much of the same approach in the middle east that the previous administrations had. This has resulted in escalating violence and political instability.


This election cycle has been completely focused on domestic issues. Personally, I'm ok with Hillary's approach to some of these issues. I like Bernie's approach to several of these as well. However, with foreign policy considered, I just can't vote for Clinton. Even in the last debate, she made a point that she recommended that Obama arm Syrians to fight the regime there. Can we not learn from past mistakes? What happened when the US armed the Mujahideen? 

This interventionist US foreign policy needs to stop and not nearly enough attention is being given to these issues in the election cycle. "

"811","1460834177","I really have a lot of issues with the Bernie or bust movement, despite liking Bernie himself.

I understand a lot of people have invested a lot of time and energy into his campaign, but if he wins, it seems counter productive to either write in or vote Green.  For starters if you write in Bernie it just won't be counted at all.  I can understand trying to send a message to the DNC, but if Hillary does win with more votes and pledged delegates, what message is that supposed to be exactly?  That the wishes of the majority are not what matter?  That doesn't sound like a very good message to me.

On the other hand, voting third party does sound possible, but has protest votes ever really worked at any time in the past?  It surely didn't work in 2000, and it didn't do any good for the reform party.  Secondly, and this is the big thing, there is a lot at stake this election.  Millions of more people have access to healthcare through insurance now, and the two most likely candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, want to undo the act that gave those people that healthcare.  If you don't have a lot to lose by having a republican as the next president, it may not sound like a bad idea to take a protest vote, but for a lot of people, they have their healthcare/health insurance on the line.  I can't in good conscious vote for someone who does not have a chance to win in the general election, when my vote could be going to someone who does actually have a chance to win.  I don't even need to mention supreme court justices (we are very close to having the first majority progressive court in a long while).  

This is just my opinion on the matter, but I really hope those who are considering Bernieorbust, consider what this election does mean to a lot of people.  "
"812","1460843307","I was feeling bad about the chance of Bernie losing because we may never have another chance at such a great candidate, but I'm starting to think I'm overreacting.

"873","1460912960","I find it amusing that people are latching onto this argument ever since it was made when whichever of Sanders' advisers (don't care to look him up since he's ridiculous) accused Hillary of tearing the party apart for her own ambitions, despite it being quite obvious that it's... *Bernie* that's tearing the party apart.

And gotta love the reliance on willfully not understanding issues (the email server/FBI investigation) in the hope she'll be disqualified, or making meaningless statements about how SNL is based in NY and since it dared make fun of her, she's somehow in trouble there."

"875","1460913776","She is going to win big in NY and will be unstoppable after that. Bernie is the one who should drop out. Bernie Bros - please continue down voting this comment, you sore losers!"
"876","1460913880","Hillary is plain and simply guilty in regards to securing top secret documents and will be indicted by the FBI. She is also guilty of political corruption using Bill's speaking fees and donations to the Clinton Foundation for political favors and influence during her years as secretary of state. For each of these charges the FBI can prove there are minimum sentences. Unless Obama pardons her, Hillary will be sentenced to jail.

2) ""She's not for ending the death penalty.""

She's said that she'd want to eliminate the death penalty from the states, and only reserve it for the most heinous documented terrorists, like the ISIS executioners and The Unabomber. 

3) ""She's not for the decriminalization of marijuana""

She supports re-scheduling, and the federal legalization of medical marijuana. She's said that she supports states' rights to legalize recreational use, like in Colorado and Washington, and that she believes they're setting a good example of how it can work.

4) She's not for a $15 minimum wage

She supports a federal minimum wage of 12 dollars per hour, and wants cities like NYC and Los Angeles to raise it to 15, where the cost of living is higher. 


5) She's for limiting certain types of abortions

She's only in favor of late-term abortion in cases of rape, incest and risk to a woman's health. This is an opinion shared by *most* people who are pro-choice.

Bring back the Bull Moose logo of Teddy Roosevelt's Progressive Party and run on a foundation of social democracy, campaign finance reform, anti-corruption, green politics, increasing taxes on the wealthiest citizens, a more non-interventionalist foreign policy, prison and drug policy reform, pro-women's and LGBTQ stances, support for election reform (getting rid of the two-party and antiquated FPTP voting system), reduced or free state college tuitions, education reform in maths and sciences with a strong focus on technical and computer skills, protection of net neutrality and personal privacy, and strong support and enforcement of antitrust laws on business monopolies particularly including financial institutions and the fossil fuel energy sector. Possibly also push for wider support and access for young people going into trades in lieu of college and help make it easier to find apprenticeship programs across the board. 

The country badly needs an actual left-wing party to combat the centrist Democrats and Right-Wing Republicans. Start with focus on local elections, city councils, state legislatures, mayoral races and then hopefully move up from there. I imagine a Party like this could easily form an alliance with the Green Party and some of the more liberal members of the Libertarian Party, too. But focusing on local elections before full state or federal races could potentially build a base over time. And if the two-party system dies out, it would be great to have an actual progressive left party to push for in countrywide elections.

It would take a lot of work from a lot of people to make it happen, but something like it could potentially benefit the country greatly in the future. Just my two cents. "

Yeah no. So as it stands the delegate count is 1095 Sanders to 1305 Clinton. That means that of pledged delegates that have been awarded, Clinton has won 54.3% of delegates to Sanders' 45.6%. So she's beating him by 9 points in *pledged* delegates. There are 1651 pledged delegates yet to be awarded. 2026 is a majority of pledged delegates. So Sanders needs 931/1651=56.4% of remaining delegates to have a majority of pledged delegates, which is almost certainly a prerequisite for super delegates switching to his side giving him an outright majority and the nomination.

So he needs to win the remaining races by an average of almost thirteen percentage points when up to this point in the race he has been loosing by an average of about 9 points.

We all have a choice, reacting to this news. We could take partisan sides, argue about the details of the trip or discuss whether it was a political ploy. Or we could talk about compassion, discuss how to work together, possibly even make amends across candidate preferences and party lines. 

When someone like the Pope tries to spread peace and compassion throughout the world he gives us an opportunity to follow his lead. He gives us a chance to look away from politics and to look inside ourselves to see what is truly good there. He gives us a chance to rise above heated policy discussions and recognize that in the end we're all in this together. 

Whether or not we agree on policy is one thing, but the more important question is whether we agree on a common goal. Do we agree that we're all in this together, that we're all living on the same Earth, that we're all intrinsically connected? Do we agree that the way to govern is to choose what is right for all of us, not just the few? Do we agree that ethics has a place in politics? Do we agree that people should have shelter and security and that we should work to provide it for the weak and infirm? Do we agree that we should work to benefit the community and not ourselves?

These are important questions that too often get lost in the intricacies of politics. I hope we all agree on the answers, but that's not the point. Just being reminded that the questions exist is enough to change the way we act. Working as individuals isn't how we improve society, but working together is. Reminding ourselves that we have a shared responsibility to take care of each other and the planet is beyond any parties or candidates, it's intrinsic to human life itself. Again -- we're all in this together. You and me, I and them, them and you. We're all one.

So please, /r/politics, let's remember that there are other things in life than politics. "

"1147","1460829848","&gt; Hillary Clinton recently blasted the hidden financial dealings exposed in the Panama Papers, but she and her husband have multiple connections with people who have used the besieged law firm Mossack Fonseca to establish offshore entities.

&gt; Among them are Gabrielle Fialkoff, finance director for Hillary Clinton’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate; Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining magnate who has traveled the globe with Bill Clinton; the Chagoury family, which pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative; and Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng, who was at the center of a Democratic fund-raising scandal when Bill Clinton was president. Also using the Panamanian law firm was the company founded by the late billionaire investor Marc Rich, an international fugitive when Bill Clinton pardoned him in the final hours of his presidency.

These aren't just meaningless connections by any stretch.

Edit: Sanders' points with respect to Clinton's judgement are likely further validated by this

&gt; Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York, said it would draw voters’ attention once again to Clinton’s ties to big money. “It certainly would play into Sanders’ narrative,” he said.

&gt; Sanders said Clinton’s support of a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Panama – one that he claims has allowed the wealthy to avoid paying taxes – should disqualify her from being the Democratic nominee for president.

&gt; “I don’t think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement, something I very strongly opposed, which has made it easier for wealthy people and corporations all over the world to avoid paying taxes owed to their countries,” Sanders said recently."

This. This uncertainty about what she actually believes in is what makes her so difficult for a lot of people to support. Even if you aren't on board with Sanders, you know what he stands for, and have to respect him for being unwavering on the majority of the issues for 30 odd years. "

"1281","1460837928","&gt; Another connection is Giustra, the director of UrAsia Energy Ltd, a British Virgin Islands offshore company registered in May 2005.

&gt; The company wanted to “conduct uranium exploration, development, production and marketing operations and related activities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,” according to a draft of the shareholders’ agreement.

&gt; UrAsia, based in British Columbia, Canada, finalized a deal in September 2005 to buy uranium mines for $500 million in Kazakhstan, according to published reports.

&gt; The deal came after Giustra joined Bill Clinton in Kazakhstan for the launch of a Clinton Foundation health initiative and dined with him and Kazakhstan’s president, among others. The timing prompted questions about whether Bill Clinton played any role in the agreement. Giustra denied that, saying it came after months of negotiations.

&gt; The following year, Giustra, who is also involved in filmmaking and founded Lionsgate Entertainment, made a donation of more than $30 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to published reports.

&gt; In total, Giustra has committed $100 million to the foundation, according to at least one report, though foundation records don’t give an exact amount, saying only that he is one of the largest individual donors giving more than $25 million. In 2007, he started an affiliated charity that bears his name and initially kept its donors secret despite a 2008 agreement between the Clintons and the Obama administration to make public foundation contributors.

Bill Clinton was jokingly said (even by many black peoples) to be the first black President.  The Clinton presidency has been largely viewed as a success, not just for liberals but also for the country.  Now, Sanders is running for President and he's trying to rewrite all of this.  And lots of people are buying this, including the Black Lives Matter folks.  With all due respect, you think George H.W Bush or any other President at the time could have done more for the African American community?  Now, they are turning against Clinton, demonizing his presidency.  This is absurd and obscene to any liberal who has a good memory of what happened in the 1990.

Remember this folks.  Bernie Sanders voted for the 1994 crime bill, which he now calls racist.   I don't know if Sanders has a hand in creating this, but his supporters are very extreme.

"1341","1460822827","The 1994 crime bill did not cause mass incarceration.  In fact, there's little evidence that it was even a major contributor to mass incarceration.

Here's the [total US prison population by year](http://i.imgur.com/BCNb3rT.jpg).  See if you can spot 1994.  

And here's the [change in the US prison population per year](http://i.imgur.com/C3SV0Yy.jpg).  Note that the rate of increase began declining right after the 1994 crime bill was enacted.

All data from John Pfaff, a Fordham law school professor and expert on mass incarceration.  Here's what Pfaff wrote in the NYT this week:

[Bill Clinton Is Wrong About His Crime Bill. So Are the Protesters He Lectured](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/magazine/bill-clinton-is-wrong-about-his-crime-bill-so-are-the-protesters-he-lectured.html?_r=0)

&gt; We know the act didn’t cause mass incarceration: Prison populations started rising around 1974, and by 1994 they had roughly tripled, from 300,000 to over one million. It’s almost surely the case that America was the world’s largest jailer well before the act was passed. So if the act didn’t cause mass incarceration, the question becomes: Did it help continue to drive it? The answer, by and large, is no.
&gt; 
&gt; For one thing, most of the act’s provisions applied only to federal crimes. The tough new anti-gang laws, the expanded death-penalty provisions, the three-strikes laws: All applied only to those tried in federal court. And those, over all, are fairly minor players, with the federal prison system holding about only 13 percent of all prisoners. The other 87 percent of inmates are in state systems — and none of the act’s new criminal laws affected what happened in state systems.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, there were some provisions of the act aimed at influencing state law. The most important was the Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing (VOI/TIS) Incentive Grant Program, which set aside about $10 billion to encourage states to make parole much rarer for people convicted of violent crimes, through what are called “truth in sentencing” laws. The grants even included funds for building out prison capacity, to deal with any resulting rise in inmate populations. If there was any part of the 1994 act that should have driven incarceration, it was this one.
&gt; 
&gt; And yet it didn’t. In a General Accounting Office study, only four states said the grants strongly influenced their decisions to adopt TIS laws. One of those four, New York, received more grant money than any other state, and its prison populations began a 15-year decline before the six-year program was even over. Almost half of the 27 states with TIS laws said the grants were irrelevant, and 23 states opted not to adopt the laws at all. All told, about 70 to 80 percent of all prisoners were held in states where the grants made no real impact. And there’s no evidence that prison populations grew any faster in states with TIS laws than in states without them."
"1342","1460823535","Pretty twisted thinking; Bill Clinton is morally responsible for the incarceration of people who broke the law and went to jail. I wonder how the 99.3% of the country's population that is NOT in jail managed to escape this deadly whirlpool? What a very sad commentary on our media and the way they reflect the culture. At some point we will have fallen so far that maybe we will recognize the importance of personal responsibility rather than universal victimhood... "

"1457","1460807921","Awesome. I'm glad, mainly because of the way the media has been trying to downplay and smear his visit. For example, been watching CBS News and here's some of what I've been seeing.

1st video segment:
CBS News anchor man explains a bit about what Bernie is going to talk about and how his values in a moral economy align with the Pope's, then the co-anchor lady finishes off the segment with ""It's important to note that the likelihood of him meeting with the Pope Francis is pretty low- in fact, he's probably not going to meet with Pope Francis and to sort of clarify too, he wasn't invited to the Vatican by the Pope but he was invited by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences- typically the Vatican does not light into issues related to politics though we have seen this Pope, ah, dabble here and there with some comments he's made along the way.""

2rd video segment:
Two CBS anchors offscreen discussing Bernie's trip. The first says that the Vatican says Pope Francis has no plans to meet with Sanders, the the second mentions how some are saying that Sanders lobbied to get the invite but that his campaign says the trip is not political. Meanwhile, the giant ticker running across the bottom of the video states ""CANDIDATE NOT LIKELY TO MEET POPE FRANCIS"".

3rd segment:
At the end if the video, CBS anchorman (live from Rome) Seth Dohn (sic) gives some obvious attitude as he says ""The Vatican has distanced itself from this invitation and has told us the Pope will not meet Senator Sanders. This trip was being billed as being above politics, Scott, but rather it seems to be all about politics.""


Edit to finish the post and correct typos as I somehow clicked submit before I was done."
"1458","1460799001","So, at the end of the day does this really surprise anyone?

This whole thing was so weird to watch unfold. Sanders comes out saying he was invited to speak at the Vatican and will meet the Pope and then the whole “no, he wasn’t invited!”-""maybe he asked for an invitation but he won’t speak!”-“maybe he’ll speak but it’s completely meaningless and the Pope won’t even be in the country!”-“okay, maybe the Pope will be in the country but he definitely will not meet Sanders!”-spiel started.

And now here we are, he was invited, he did speak and he did meet the Pope. Did anybody actually believe Sanders was lying?

Edit: Aaaand a quick glance at /r/HRC lets the spiel continue!

* The meeting probably never happened, reports are fake!

* If it did happen, it was a pity meeting!

* Maybe it happened, but meeting the Pope was definitely not worth leaving NY for! ^(also Sanders is a fraud for spending the money of poor college students on his family vacation)

* Meeting the Pope was the lowest move of his campaign so far!

You have to love American politics :’)

&gt; However, Francis has been known to flout Vatican protocol, and the meeting with Sanders is evidence that his personal desires often trump Vatican diplomacy.

George would show off his handy dandy shiny grill, cook up some fabulous chickens and burgers and veggies and his guests would agree that it was indeed the most fabulous indoor grill they had ever seen.

Then George (in an attempt to be fair and show comparison), pulls out a competitor's grill.  He bangs it around, half-breaking it, cooks food that is half-burnt or half raw and everyone agrees that it's an overpriced piece of junk.  No one is surprised at his assessment and his guests are quite horrified that anyone would even think of purchasing it over George's superior product.

People in America and Europe cannot understand living with a neighbor who is dedicated to your destruction.  Yes, you too are committing atrocities, but it is to protect your people.  If America restrains the Isrealis, the Palestinians and the Arab world aren't going to reciprocate with restraint.  That's not how this works.  The presence of other Western Powers is the only thing keeping the Palestinians alive, Isreal would have wiped all of them out long ago without western pressure.  

People who say that shouldn't have to choose between the lesser of two evils don't understand reality.  In general, picking between two evils is all anyone ever does.  I voted twice for Obama, but Obama has done a lot of stuff in office that I am vehemently opposed to.  That doesn't mean I regret voting for him.  He's done a lot of bad stuff, but, on balance, I feel he's a better chief executive than Romney or McCain would be, so I went with him for my vote.  Lesser of two evils, because I have to vote for someone, and no one I could vote for is completely in line with my views.  

Bottom Line: the reality, on the ground, is different than what you get from a western perch through the media.  On the ground, what you do to protect your own is different than what you say you would do when you don't have to confront the daily realities.  "

Sanders himself couldn't explain what he meant by that statement in the interview, or what he would have done differently if he was in Israel's shoes. The constant rocket barrages meant that a huge portion of Israel's population had to live in bomb shelters. Israel did exactly what it had to do to stop the rockets and it was successful.

&gt;You actually have plenty of nice things to say about Bernie Sanders. I think you did an interview with TheGuardian where you said you like the issues he was bringing up, you thought he was actually pushing Hillary Clinton in a certain way. I am curious; why did you pick Clinton over Sanders?

&gt;GEORGE CLOONEY:

&gt;Well, I've worked with Secretary Clinton as Secretary particularly when the Sudan and South Sudan were looking to vote for their own independence and it was an incredibly dangerous time for that country. And there were, you know, hundreds of thousands of people's lives at risk.

&gt;And between the Secretary and the Security Council and some of the people on the ground and Kofi Anan and Jimmy Carter and people like that and thousands of people on the ground, we worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen. She understood it. She understood the issues even though we don't have any great reason to pay much attention to Sudan. We don't trade with them. We don't get money from them. I found her to know, to be knowledgeable and to be-- and to care about the issues. And we've worked together since then and I've been a very big fan of hers. But I want to say this: I really like Bernie. I think what he's saying in this election is important if you're a Democrat. Again to have these conversations, I hope he stays in for the entire election and if he were to win the nomination, I will do whatever I can including if asked a fundraiser like this again to try to give him or her, Hillary, I hope she wins a Senate because honestly we see what happens when a President tries to get their Supreme Court justice confirmed without the Senate.

Furthermore it seems to me to be totally principled to not vote for Hilary Clinton should she win the nomination.  We know the basic fundamental differences between these two candidates.  Voting for Hilary because she is the Democratic nominee means voting for everything you are against and these are fundamental differences that will effect the majority of people in this country and the world!  

Furthermore, if you look at the history of big changes in this country that were won by mass movements -- like forcing the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam, and it did not matter who was the president, Democrat or Republican.  When the people take the stage of history, it is like what Alice in Wonderland said about the Queen and her court, ""Why you are all a pack of cards""  They become a house of cards.

To add to this, I think if Bernie Sanders supports Hilary if he does not win, what will this do to the millions of supporters who have rallied to his cause?  What kind of demoralization will that cause.  What will it do to these supporters' belief that people can seem to strongly support the moral causes that Bernie supports and then turn around and support and campaign for the very people who are dead set against these positions.  It is like he just championed these positions like Hilary has been doing lately  -- just to win.

Think of what he has said about Pope Francis and then his turning around to support a person representing the antithesis of these views.

I am demoralized just thinking about this.  I was a radical in the 1960's -1970's.  I saw many becoming enamored of this or that Democratic candidate during elections and therefore stopping their protests against the war or for women's rights, etc.  Then, those people abandoned their campaign pledges  once they were elected.  There is no such thing as lesser evil.  Evil is Evil.

Read Malcolm X on the two parties.  Consider, that Martin Luther King was assassinated after he began to support the anti Vietnam war movement and to more further to the left on military and economic positions and to come closer to Malcolm X.  What might he have said about the Democratic Party.

I was so excited when I interviewed there. You could practically push the invisible piles of money out of the way when walking down the halls. The energy was amazing. Everything glittered with promise. I admit it, even at 40 years old, I got sucked right into the cult.

We had meals served in the cafeteria twice a day. Not just buffet, but you could get pizza and paninis to order. There were themed, fully stocked kitchens on each floor and a gym, arcade, and bar on the bottom floor. There was even an indoor basketball court. Yoga classes, acupuncture, and massages. Happy hour with free beer and wine on Fridays. Teams that were making money went to Vegas, Tahoe, even Hawaii.

My team started crunching shortly after I started and we had meals catered to our suite 3 times a day so we didn't have to take the time to leave to get food. Once a week they offered massages and acupuncture in one of our conference rooms so you didn't have to leave the suite. People started working until midnight, 2AM, and finally in the last couple of months some would get applauded for staying overnight. It became a hero culture - who can work the most hours, who's the most committed, who's giving it their all. It started to really feel kind of sick. Stress levels were insane. You'd feel guilty if you left before 9PM, and people often went home and then worked several more hours. If you weren't giving it EVERYTHING, you were failing the team and everyone knew it.

Some people thrived on it. I had a family, and I ultimately failed out from the stress of trying to balance that with the chaos and pressure of work. All of those perks could not make up for the pressure to perform and be a superhero. When I resigned, I could almost physically feel the weight lift from me. When I went back up to the suite after signing the papers with HR, someone said ""Wow, you look so... *happy*."" It felt like the first time I'd smiled in months. Not long after our game launched, the team was disbanded. Some were laid off, some were moved to other projects. Not too long after that the company laid off hundreds of people who had given them everything only to be discarded.

Anyway, my situation is not unique. I knew so many people who were also lured by the promise of perks and equity and eventually discovered they'd signed up for a treadmill that goes 12 miles an hour and will exhaust you before it throws you off. In the Bay Area that company was one of the biggest, but the culture isn't unique. "

Okay, I can see you're really emotional about this so I'll just try to respond calmly. :)

I've been an independent for 27 years (if it matters, I'm 45 and female). My first vote in a general was for Perot and the next two I think were for Browne.

In 2004, I not only voted for Kerry I plastered my U-haul with Kerry signs on my coast-to-coast move. I hated Bush SO much. I didn't love Kerry, and I thought (despite being a liberal) that the DNC was full of shit, but I really wanted us out of the war. It was at the DNC convention that year that I saw a young senatorial candidate give a speech. I turned to my (now ex) husband and said, ""Holy shit, that guy is going to be our first black President.""

I donated to Obama in 2008 and was ecstatic when he won. I really thought he was our best hope. I donated and voted for him again in 2012, but maybe with not as much enthusiasm. 

In all of this, I never registered as a Democrat. Although I aligned with them on some things and sometimes voted a straight blue ticket, I always felt like my vote was my own. *I* would decide which candidates I best aligned with. 

And to be honest, I have *never* liked the Clintons. I remember the Clintons when they were in office. Despite Bill being the ""cool"" President, I didn't like the way they aligned with the Republicans on too many things. Some things just felt really shady. I hated how both of them acted during Monicagate. 

So here we are now and it's 2016 and finally there's a candidate who I really like. He represents ME. He represents US.

So what does the DNC do? Everything they can to keep him down. From the debate schedule to the way DWS wouldn't even *mention* him during interviews the first few months. It was all Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. The way she spoke about him when the data breach happened. The way the top DNC folks spoke dismissively about him and glowingly about Clinton. The way Clinton herself tried to paint him as a sexist because he said people were shouting about guns. The way the Hillary supporters acted on social media. The way the actual media never covered him, or dismissed him when they did. The list goes on and on.

So if he doesn't get the nomination, I am supposed to do... what? Fall in line because the alternative is worse? What message does my vote send? Here's the answer: it says that I'm okay with how this whole thing went down. It says that I support Hillary's policies. It says I support the DNC and their coronation.

I'm sorry, but I've already lived through bad. I've lived through the crushing disappointment of having my candidate (Kerry) lose to the devil. As a country we survived it then and we'll survive it again.

But in the end my vote is my own, and it is not *owed* to anyone. 

If the DNC didn't want to lose my independent vote they should have backed the candidate I wanted to vote for. Don't blame people for not voting for the Democratic candidate. Blame the Democrats for not backing the candidate people wanted to vote for."

If you cared about social issues, then you are literally ripping off  your nose and spitting in your face.  You really do not understand what a Republican White House and Congress will entail.  They wrecked havoc last time, and they have only become more radically regressive. 

Not to mention, the ability to appoint more Supreme Court Justices.  You will be fighting years, if not decades, to roll back the harm caused by a Republican dominated Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. 

I am all for Sanders, but your argument lacks evidence and is all based on speculation that there will be enough Sanders supporters sitting out to ""punish"" Hillary and that the Dems will magically learn from this. 

The risks are not symmetrical.  There is true risk of a Republican WH, Congress, and SCOTUS, while you resort to a speculation about the future.

Her foreign policy is fucking terrifying.  The Neo-lib-con foreign policy of regime change needs to end before we get even more of the world population hating us.

Her economic plan does nothing as far as im concerned.  We'll continue to see lowered growth expectation while inequality grows even further.

Her lip service on social issues is flimsy at best.  I don't know where she truly stance on any social issue at this point.

She cool with sticking with Merrick Garland in the supreme court, which is a travesty.

Anyone saying she'll be able to get more done in a republican congress is kidding themselves.  Republicans **HATE** Hillary.  I don't think dems really realize this.  At least they work with Bernie on issues, they won't do anything with Hillary that shows her in a positive light."

If you want money out of politics, then you better make damn sure that the republicans don't get to appoint the next justice."
"1782","1460857935","For the sake of argument let's assume I concede that Hillary is as toxic as any of the GOP candidates. Does this mean that she would rubberstamp any legislation or nomination Republicans put before her? That she would do nothing for Democrats and work purely for Republican interests?

I get that she's not your first pick - but when you lose an election you either learn what ""compromise"" means or you get exactly nothing.

-----------

Okay, I can see you're really emotional about this so I'll just try to respond calmly. :)

I've been an independent for 27 years (if it matters, I'm 45 and female). My first vote in a general was for Perot and the next two I think were for Browne.

In 2004, I not only voted for Kerry I plastered my U-haul with Kerry signs on my coast-to-coast move. I hated Bush SO much. I didn't love Kerry, and I thought (despite being a liberal) that the DNC was full of shit, but I really wanted us out of the war. It was at the DNC convention that year that I saw a young senatorial candidate give a speech. I turned to my (now ex) husband and said, ""Holy shit, that guy is going to be our first black President.""

I donated to Obama in 2008 and was ecstatic when he won. I really thought he was our best hope. I donated and voted for him again in 2012, but maybe with not as much enthusiasm. 

In all of this, I never registered as a Democrat. Although I aligned with them on some things and sometimes voted a straight blue ticket, I always felt like my vote was my own. *I* would decide which candidates I best aligned with. 

And to be honest, I have *never* liked the Clintons. I remember the Clintons when they were in office. Despite Bill being the ""cool"" President, I didn't like the way they aligned with the Republicans on too many things. Some things just felt really shady. I hated how both of them acted during Monicagate. 

So here we are now and it's 2016 and finally there's a candidate who I really like. He represents ME. He represents US.

So what does the DNC do? Everything they can to keep him down. From the debate schedule to the way DWS wouldn't even *mention* him during interviews the first few months. It was all Hillary, Hillary, Hillary. The way she spoke about him when the data breach happened. The way the top DNC folks spoke dismissively about him and glowingly about Clinton. The way Clinton herself tried to paint him as a sexist because he said people were shouting about guns. The way the Hillary supporters acted on social media. The way the actual media never covered him, or dismissed him when they did. The list goes on and on.

So if he doesn't get the nomination, I am supposed to do... what? Fall in line because the alternative is worse? What message does my vote send? Here's the answer: it says that I'm okay with how this whole thing went down. It says that I support Hillary's policies. It says I support the DNC and their coronation.

I'm sorry, but I've already lived through bad. I've lived through the crushing disappointment of having my candidate (Kerry) lose to the devil. As a country we survived it then and we'll survive it again.

But in the end my vote is my own, and it is not *owed* to anyone. 

If the DNC didn't want to lose my independent vote they should have backed the candidate I wanted to vote for. Don't blame people for not voting for the Democratic candidate. Blame the Democrats for not backing the candidate people wanted to vote for."

&gt;A defeat for Clinton in November sends a message to the Democratic Party and its leaders to wake the fuck up. Stop playing the bullshit Republican game with Liberal social issues.

If you cared about social issues, then you are literally ripping off  your nose and spitting in your face.  You really do not understand what a Republican White House and Congress will entail.  They wrecked havoc last time, and they have only become more radically regressive. 

Not to mention, the ability to appoint more Supreme Court Justices.  You will be fighting years, if not decades, to roll back the harm caused by a Republican dominated Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. 

I am all for Sanders, but your argument lacks evidence and is all based on speculation that there will be enough Sanders supporters sitting out to ""punish"" Hillary and that the Dems will magically learn from this. 

The risks are not symmetrical.  There is true risk of a Republican WH, Congress, and SCOTUS, while you resort to a speculation about the future.

Modern liberal voters want purity. Which is exactly what you do not get in a democracy. You get compromise and baby steps. Hillary is the candidate that is used to these compromises, which is why she looks so evil to the modern liberal. 

Of course it's because of this purity issue that we now have a majority of state legislatures controlled by republicans, the majority of governors are Republican, and the power of the Republicans in Congress.

We want a living wage of something closer to $15 across the nation, where states that will have higher minimum wage needs will pass local legislation. When Clinton doesn't fully commit to $15, the message we get is ""I want a minimum wage, not a living wage.""

&gt; The Alaska Democratic party, in its end of the year filing with the FEC, said it **raised $43,500 from the Hillary Victory Fund** with 10,000.00 dollar **donations from Clinton friends and billionaires**, including hedge fund manage S Donald Sussman, and Hyatt Hotel heir JB Pritzker. ( two of the several $10,000  donors to the Montana State Democratic Party) . But in the same report it said it **transferred the same amount of money, $43,500 back to the DNC** – .  a technically legal move that effectively obliterates federal limits on donations to the national committee.

"1981","1460844020","This is how $27.2 million of the $33 million raised was spent:

* $5.5 million on direct marketing    
* $3.5 million to DNC   
* $2 million to State parties    
   
Even being generous, half of the money spent by the Hillary Victory Fund went to support Hillary.  In reality, it was far more.  Clinton is just using this fund as a loophole to get around the $2,700 individual limit on direct campaign contributions. The money that ends up in others hands is the vig, just a cost of laundering the money.

The real problem is the amount of poor and middle class individuals who still aren't getting the health care they need because instead of single payer we have this shit compromise that insists on insurance middlemen.

Sure, they're ""covered"" (or they're not covered because they are too poor to pay the penalty, and don't have the energy to spend hours jumping through hoops so they pay one more monthly bill when they know if anything goes really bad they'll still get fucked), but that doesn't mean they can pay co-pays and deductibles.

He said he wanted a ban on assault weapons when he first ran in Vermont, then he dropped it after losing the election. I expected him to have a better thought out position on gun control. 

Hillary also attacked him for not having a clear plan and I was disappointed that he didn't refute that.

"2320","1460826372","&gt;Seven years earlier, on 16 January 1998, Lewinsky’s friend – an older work colleague called Linda Tripp – invited her for lunch at a mall in Washington DC. Lewinsky was 25. They’d been working together at the Pentagon for nearly two years, during which time Lewinsky had confided in her that she’d had an affair with President Bill Clinton. Unbeknown to Lewinsky, Tripp had been secretly recording their telephone conversations – more than 20 hours of them. The lunch was a trap. When Tripp arrived, she motioned behind her and two federal agents suddenly appeared. “You’re in trouble,” they told Lewinsky.

&gt;She was bustled upstairs to a hotel room filled with prosecutors and federal agents. She started to cry. They told her they were investigating claims that President Clinton had sexually harassed a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Jones, and that if Lewinsky didn’t cooperate with them she’d be charged with perjury and jailed for 27 years.

That seems pretty messed up.  So two people engage in a sexual act and one seems to get thrown under the bus?  I think Bill Clinton gets some razzing, but it's crazy how difficult people made her life for something that wasn't just her decision-making.  "
"2321","1460825621","I wish her success and strength. I can't imagine being shamed for something I did 20 years ago. We all fuck up in one way or another (especially when you're young), but imagine not being able to go into public without people asking about your fuck up. Everyone knowing something that should have been personal and commenting on it like they're masters of their own life...That would suck. All of the semen comments here are just a drop in what must be a one ugly waterfall.

I wonder if the looming election will open it all back up. If it does, I hope she stands up against it. "
"2322","1460841346","The worst thing that was done to her was an official act by Special Prosecutor Ken Starr and his staff. They released a report to the public on their investigation that contained detailed, specific descriptions of sex acts between the president and Ms. Lewinsky. The president was a public figure and under investigation. Ms Lewinsky was a young, private citizen. While it's debatable whether the report violated the President's right to privacy (by publishing superfluous details), surely that report was a ghastly violation of Ms Lewinsky's privacy. Can you imagine having the United States government publishing a widely-read report that described your sexual encounters in detail?  Even though you weren't accused of any legal violation? Shame on Ken Starr. Shame."

Every wealthy person in Saudi Arabia is a ""Saudi Prince"" in the Saudi ""Royal Family"".  There are [FIFTEEN THOUSAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud) of them.  It's their government service title.

&gt;The family is estimated to be composed of 15,000 members, but the majority of the power and wealth is possessed by a group of only about 2,000.

And many of those have donated to terrorists or sent money to their wayward children who are terrorists, etc.  Just as many Americans have.  Ahem.

But that doesn't make Saudi Arabia, as a sovereign nation, a supporter of 9/11 as a matter of national policy.

The best analogy would be to claim that the US government was behind the bombing of the Oklahoma Federal Building because Timothy McVeigh's dad sent him money for Christmas...and his dad worked for the US Post Office.  Ahem.

That's clearly NOT the same as President Obama ordering the FBI to help McVeigh blow up one of our own buildings, is it?  Not even close.

The same is true of the actual Saudi Royal inner circle...who have been MERCILESS in dealing with Al Qaeda sympathizers over the years.  Beheadings en masse for anyone even remotely connected to AQ on the peninsula or elsewhere.

Which is what both parties, and quite frankly anyone who has paid any attention to this issue since 2001, already know, understand, and realize is a complete non-issue.

"2388","1460833963","This is what Obama said about Gen. Petraeus, right after the FBI told him about the investigation that had been going on for months. 
""I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security,""  
 
Obama when asked about Clinton's legal woes,  “I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America’s national security. what I’ve also said is that—and she has acknowledged—that there’s a carelessness, in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes.”

Sound familiar?

Obama says lots of things... 

His comments on Trayvon Martin as the trial was underway.
""My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" Obama said. ""All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves."" America did and Zimmerman was acquitted.

Obama's comments on the justified shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.

“In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement,” Mr. Obama said. “Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement — guilty of walking while black or driving while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentment and hopelessness.”. Outcome, Ferguson Riots.

In 2011 Obama sided with the Occupy Wall Street movement. 

""American people understand that not everybody's been following the rules,"" he said. ""These days, a lot of folks doing the right thing are not rewarded. A lot of folks who are not doing the right thing are rewarded. That will express itself until 2012 and beyond until people feel they are getting back to old-fashioned American values.""
 The movement went nowhere and caused major property damage where ever it went.

When in Egypt in 2009 speaking in Cairo he pledged, ""to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.""

As the Arab Spring began he commented, ""There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be."" He sided with the Muslim Brotherhood and further destabilized the Middle East...

The War in Syria which was a result of siding with the wrong team in Egypt. Red Line, what Red Line?

And now here we are, he was invited, he did speak and he did meet the Pope. Did anybody actually believe Sanders was lying?

Edit: Aaaand a quick glance at /r/HRC let’s the spiel continue!

* The meeting probably never happened, reports are fake!

* If it did happen, it was a pity meeting!

* Maybe it happened, but meeting the Pope was definitely not worth leaving NY for!

* Meeting the Pope was the lowest move of his campaign so far!

The system is working as intended. If a single candidate cannot command a majority of delegates come the convention then the Party swings towards a contested or brokered convention. 

This is part of the rules of the game. The candidates get the chance to have (R) next to their name on the ballot paper. The price for this is, and has always been, to sign up to the Republican rules. That letter and that Party endorsement is the key to being competitive in the General. No candidate is forced to seek the Republican nomination. They do it because they would be blown out of the water as an independent. 

It is, at heart, about the Republican Party trying to win the Presidential Election. The Nominee is the vehicle but the Party is the one in the driving seat.

"2653","1460772568","I love Rosario, but I really wish I could get arrested like this and have it not have an adverse effect on the rest of my financial life. "
"2654","1460763494","Matt will break her out."
"2655","1460757315","Maybe now the media will report the protests?"
"2656","1460758352","I LOVE YOU ROSARIO! She has been such a great voice for the people. This time she went that extra step and flew to DC to stand against money in politics and I can not heap on enough praise. The democracy springs movement has unjustly received little to NO airtime on major networks and her presence will get it covered. Thank you Rosario"

"2666","1460777278","Although I am glad to hear her join the movement, she talks about millionaires and billionaires when she is estimated to be worth 16 million."
"2667","1460827698","I'd take her into custody. I've had a crush on her forever.   

Plus I totally agree with what she did. I've gotten arrested for attending a protest before. I didn't cross a police line or anything. They just started pulling random people out of the crowd and arresting us. The judge threw all charges out, and I didn't have to pay anything. I didn't even see the judge - She just ordered the cops to release everybody they arrested."

"2672","1460773810","Well, I don't want to question the clearly keen legal scholarship of Ms. Dawson, but what exactly about *Citizens United* is it that she wants overturned?

First amendment protections for corporations?  That was established long before *Citizens United*, and is the whole reason the New York Times is able to do really any of the things it does.  Nor is there any basis in the first amendment for extending press rights to corporations but not free speech.

Money as speech?  Okay, but that opens up a *lot* of side-door maneuvers to suppress both freedom of speech and of press.  If money spent to create or disseminate speech is not protected as speech, criticism of the government which requires any resources beyond ""going door to door"" could be limited.

Corporations aren't people?  Completely irrelevant and (as even Lawrence Lessig accepts) did not factor into the decision.

Sincerely,

Your friendly neighborhood lawyer-man."

"2681","1460802369","It gets absurd when they simply ""process"" people at a picnic table and let them go.

You don't need much more proof than that.  Arresting people for whatever they passively did is silly and meaningless.  I bet they all get a nice fine to help pad the police budget."
"2682","1460804696","And before you get put in a wheelchair."
"2683","1460806114","As if I needed another reason to have a crush on Rosario Dawson.  She is just awesome."
"2684","1460808507","This is perhaps a bit late, and will probably be buried, but can someone enlighten me as to why these protesters are being arrested?"
"2685","1460813682","I agree with you in general, and disagree with you in general, and disagree with you in this season, which I was hoping they would do more... something, you know?"
"2686","1460814844","Why was she arrested"
"2687","1460821529","&gt;""The millionaires and billionaires don’t want to see that,” Dawson said

Why Hillary. She's very qualified you know.  "
"2690","1460840702","It makes sense economically for both workers and companies but the reason that many companies don't support it is because it would remove a key bit of leverage that they have over workers (employer sponsored insurance) that they hold over the heads of workers to exploit them"

"2718","1460784002","#GUYS THIS IS NOTHING NEW

NY Primaries are routinely much shorter hours than their general election counterparts.  This isn't some voter suppression shit.  There's a lot less people who show up to the polls for primaries, especially closed ones.  Be happy they go to 9 pm.  That's a lot better than many states.  Noon - 9 is a lot better for most people than 8 to 5."

So that's about 6,180,000 in total Upstate minus Erie, a little under a third of the whole state.

The majority of the state lives in NYC and it's suburbs; absolutely. Doesn't mean Upstate's voice should be smaller than it already is."

"2729","1460817618","People coming on here and talking about voting hours and delegate math just goes to substantiate the fake democracy production.  If people could just let go, just give up on the absurd democracy show, than the leaders would have to be more accountable to the people.  In China people have no illusion of having a say.  Therefore the leaders have to at least appear on some level to be going after corruption.  The leaders and people of China know that there is only one way people can make change.  Therefore there is more accountability.  

Here in the US we have a continuous, unabated circle of corruption.  Clinton took money from Saudis and then [sold them weapons in office](http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187).  She is about to win yet another election in the state where Saudis flew airplanes into office buildings killing thousands of people.  In China, if an official openly took millions of dollars in donations from people associated with a country whose citizens attacked them and then pushed through sales of FIGHTER JETS to them, they'd be put in jail for the rest of their life.

When I asked one of the top comments if they had any idea how much any of the other candidates earned and paid in taxes, the only response was downvote and claims of the Clinton donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity....

Florida is a toss-up, but if there is a large Democratic WH win this year, that'll probably go blue too.

Arizona, Missouri and North Carolina are long shots but if it turns out to be a very good year, some of those *could* flip.

"3054","1460837053","The inheritance tax is American and one of the best places to tax

The inheritance tax is often a point of contention between liberals and conservatives. As I will demonstrate, liberals are on the right side of this argument from both an economic and ethical standpoint. I will also debunk the common right talking points.

**From an ethical standpoint**

While Americans have a history of despising taxes, the inheritance is as American as you can get (when I talk about inheritance tax, I mean very large inheritances). Your lot in life should be based off of hard work, skill acquisition, education, experience, ingenuity, the value of your contributions to society, and perhaps a little luck. These are American values which liberals embrace. Conservatives, on the other hand, believe that your lot in life should be determined by the vagina you were born out of it. These are not American values. There is a fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives when it come to wealth creation.

It is also there to prevent large inter generational wealth transfers that could pervert a functional Democracy. America was founded on the idea that power and wealth was not handed down like Kings and Queens handed it down to their offspring, but created by individual endeavor.

**From an economic standpoint**

The inheritance is a very efficient tax. It does not create a lot of market distortions. For example, it is not like high sales tax, which could lead to people not buying as much as they would otherwise. If anything, large inheritances creates perverse distortions as it removes people from the labor force who would have otherwise participated. From an economic perspective it is difficult to find a more efficient tax.

**Common RW Talking Points.**

**It is theft** - If you take that view, then all taxes could be argued as theft, and you are essentially arguing from a point of anarchy.

**It is class warfare** - Every dollar not captured by the inheritance tax means that the government needs to tax elsewhere. This will lead to higher sales tax and/or higher income tax. Therefore you are pushing the tax burden onto the poor (sales tax) or working class (income tax). Essentially, you are waging class warfare also, but against the lower and middle income classes.

**It will bankrupt small businesses and farms** - No it won't. Only 0.003 of all estates are captured by the estate tax will be small businesses and farms, and they will owe a modest amount (14.3%). There is no evidence that these estates face liquidity constraints.
http://www.cbpp.org/research/impact-of-estate-tax-on-small-businesses-and-farms-is-minimal

**Parents should be able to provide for their children** - Most parents will not die until until they have grandchildren. Therefore, when they pass their estate onto their children, the ""children"" are already middle-aged and have a family of their own. Therefore, if your children are waiting for you to die in order to make something of themselves, then you failed as a parent. They should be financially dependent already. Plus, only large estates are tax, currently over $10 million. If your children cannot survive without more than $10 million in wealth, then you failed as a parent.

**It is double taxed** - So what and not quite true.  There is no law against double taxation and many things are doubled taxed.  Many of the end items you buy have already been taxed before in the production process, through at least labor, but then we also have a sales tax. 

Plus, it is not quite true.  Usually, capital gains are taxed when the asset is sold or disposed of and the gain is “realized.” But if a person holds an asset that grows in value until his or her death, that “unrealized” capital gain is forgiven, and neither the heir of the estate nor the deceased person is taxed on it. These unrealized capital gains account for a significant proportion of the assets held by large estates — ranging from 32 percent for estates worth between $5 million and $10 million to as much as about 55 percent of the value of estates worth more than $100 million (see pie chart). 
http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-the-estate-tax 

Cons hate the estate tax and would like to see it abolished. However, when asked where is a better place to tax, they come up short. Instead, they would rather tax current income, shift the burden onto the poor with higher sales taxes, increase taxes on home owners through higher property taxes. These taxes create greater economic inefficiency and ""punish"" current success, but sadly cons would rather punish current success rather than unearned success."
"3055","1460834145","Why should people be taxed twice on the same money?"
"3056","1460752357","Joel Benenson, Clinton chief campaign strategists and spokesman, said this morning on CNN that voters don't need to see the Wall St transcripts and that Hillary would not be releasing them.  "

"3059","1460738108","Lets not pretend that if she ""releases the speeches"" that they will be verbatim of what they were when she gave them.

They will be edited to hell and back to make her look better, just like the MSM released video of the BLM activist thrown out of her private speech party which happened to leave out ""I've never had anyone ask me that question before, you are the first"" as well as ""Back to the issues"".

I don't want her to release her speeches, I want someone else to."
"3060","1460740011","She will release them....

Then Hillary will come out of nowhere lightning fast and kick this talking point in its raised tone ass"
"3061","1460764455","Someone should write the speeches, make them damning and incriminating, juicy stuff - and release them anonymously.

Then when Hil says those speeches are faked then we can say ""prove it - show us the real speeches."" OR if she says nothing it means the real speeches are even worse than the fake ones, and she hopes people believe the fake ones."
"3062","1460761496","Hilary is probably in the most stressful position of any politician could possibly be in a campaign.  

She has the FBI investigation looming which is bad enough for an elected politician but for someone *running* it's incredibly precarious. Whether she's guilty of anything or not, the FBI will interview her and try to catch her perjuring herself, which is very often how these things go.

Then we have these transcripts. Which is an impossible spot for her, there's bound to be something in them that is detrimental to her campaign. She can't clean them up and release them because that could cause someone else to come forward to contradict the content with video or something. Not to mention any day they could be leaked (and likely will be). 

Say what you will about Bernie but he is giving her a run for her money and really making her look bad in the primaries. He's a tough opponent to attack without making her look conservative. She's having to move a lot farther to the left than she probably wanted to (TPP, breaking up banks, more explicit rhetoric on income inequality, campaign finance reform, etc.) which will make it harder for her to move back to the center in the general and may come back to haunt her in office. 

She may be doing alright in the election currently but I really don't envy her position."
"3063","1460756589","If she released them in the beginning, the fallout could have already been dealt with. Now it just looks worse. Now its a thing that'll hang over the rest of her campaign. What's in those $200,000 Wall Street speeches she doesn't want people to see?

We're at peak absurdity when [she's using a fucking noise machine to block out reporters from hearing her remarks.](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/10/waitclinton-has-a-static-noise-machine-n2145436) That is ridiculous.

"3064","1460738579","Usually what people imagine is worse than reality. Her refusal to release them, makes me think it might be really as bad as we imagine. "
"3065","1460752161","""Buzzfeed has confirmed""

Fucking dropped it right there and I voted for Bernie"
"3066","1460738600","""Release of the transcripts would therefore, it appears, have three immediate — and possibly fatal — consequences for Clinton’s presidential campaign:

It would reveal that Clinton lied about the content of the speeches at a time when she suspected she would never have to release them, nor that their content would ever be known to voters.

It would reveal that the massive campaign and super-PAC contributions Clinton has received from Wall Street did indeed, as Sanders has alleged, influence her ability to get tough on Wall Street malfeasance either in Congress or behind closed doors.

It would reveal that Clinton’s policy positions on — for instance — breaking up “too-big-to-fail” banks are almost certainly insincere, as they have been trotted out merely for the purposes of a presidential campaign."""

It is interesting getting into a discussion with a Staunch Hillary supporter because they become entrenched when you are only discussing one or two issues. Regardless of the severity these issues are often dismissed as being republican agenda, or trivial. Even something as severe as taking money from special interests is seen as status quo, so why is it a problem?

We can draw a couple of conclusions from this. a)Sanders realizes he is not going to be the Democrats' nominee, and so he can afford to leave instead of working the New York campaign; it will make no difference to the ultimate outcome. b)Francis, who popularized the phrase ""moral economy,"" is, in addition to (or instead of) heading a major religious order, selling a secularist economic ideology through deceptive advertising, meddling in the political processes of foreign nations, and trying to conceal it behind equivocative comments. c)Sanders considers his role now to be one of promoting that marketing program for a ""moral economy,"" not winning the party's nomination."

That ship has already sailed.  Clinton will lose the votes of more  Sanders' supporters if she continues to perpetrate smears similar to the bogus Vermont gun report and the Sandy Hook nonsense which exploited Newtown's grief in order to score political points.

&gt;he questioned if she had the same “courage” that he had. He repeatedly challenged her credentials as a fellow progressive, using some of the same language he aims at Mrs. Clinton. In the end, he damaged Ms. Kunin politically, as some Clinton supporters and political analysts think he may do in the current race.

&gt;Bernie is hardly the all-positive, all-substance guy that he claims to be,” said Garrison Nelson, a longtime political science professor at the University of Vermont.

&gt;In Vermont, however, Mr. Sanders was known for belittling opponents at times, rather than merely challenging their ideas.

&gt;“He’s not going to say, ‘She’s a woman, she’s not qualified,’” said Ms. Kunin, who was re-elected with 47 percent of the vote after Mr. Sanders siphoned off some support. “But he can paint a very subtle illusion talking about qualifications and judgment.”

Buprenorphine is also being looked at as a potential anti depressant and is currently being used as a pain killer in some instances (butrans patch).

It binds to the opioid receptors so strongly that it knocks off any other opioid drug currently in the system and makes it extremely difficult to get high off opiates while on it. The naloxone formulation makes it very uncomfortable to IV (and newer strip formulations make it even more difficult).

While it's still an opioid, meaning the patients would still be opioid dependent while on treatment, it has the capacity to interrupt many of the destructive patterns involved in opiate addiction, with a fraction of the side effects of methodone, and even without insurance it's cheaper than a street drug addiction. It has the potential to be a highly treatment for those who can get it. I really hope we see more proactive steps like the one Mr. Paul is taking.

The fact that wages were allowed to stay so low, all while corporate profits and equity markets soared prove there is a problem. If the lowest paid workers among us get paid wages that are below poverty levels. Then every single one us will be paid less. Maybe the price of goods and services would rise with an increase in the minimum wage, but I guarantee that those price increases don't outpace the rise in wages. That is nothing more than an excuse to keep as much of the profit made off the backs of the working class as possible. Everone needs to stand up and be counted as saying we will not give another inch and it ends now."

"3461","1460739497","If you're interested in some insight into what capitalism really is and why it prevails, take a look at ""The New Spirit of Capitalism"" by Boltanski and Chiapello. 
One aspect to think about: Capitalism is a system without inherent ethic values, more so it lends them from the outside system. Which makes it adaptable in a way that it changes it's form when faced with criticism. 
In harsh words: we will not overcome the system ""capitalism"" in any way anytime soon, we won't change its ""heart"", only it's face."

"3463","1460764348","So a lot of people here are raising the good point of how since adopting capitalism the world has lifted many out of poverty and we've seen vast technological developments. As you praise capitalism, I encourage you to also take a step back. Look at the larger picture and in a more a abstract sense, try and dissect what capitalism is and why it's been successful. It's not that capitalism is some magic wand, it's a system that has underlying mechanisms which have brought us this growth. Ask yourself what those mechanisms are, and how we can strengthen those mechanisms. At the same time, look at the problems it has been unable to solve, and how we can fix that. Because while we've seen great growth, you can't deny the crummy materialistic consumer culture it promotes through constant manipulative advertisements to sell us products we don't actually need, and the amount of environmental damage we've caused for the sake of cost savings and convenience.

To me, what I believe has made capitalism successful is that it distributed power. It gave people much more control over their lives and their communities, where previously the decision making had come from the top down and people had mostly pre defined roles. It was too rigid. The people making the decisions were too far removed to even know what was going on or how their decisions affected the people, and obviously those making the decisions have their own interests held above others. Capitalism smashed this idea at first, but it hasn't solved it. Time and time again, our economic power gets concentrated again in the hands of the few, and the engine stalls."

They want to encourage companies to grow rather than just give the money to shareholders. Shareholders like this because it increases the value of the company and boosts their share value (which gets taxed when they sell).

It is crushing to hear the world-known activist listing all the oppression in Honduras, how the illegal coup was carried out to benefit the oligarchs, how Hillary Clinton was the main thrust behind legitimizing the military coup, how her friends are getting assassinated for standing up to the foreign special interests that toppled Zelaya's government, the list of issues/demands the poor in Honduras are dying for...

... but most crushingly... she predicted her death and was fearful then for her life (before getting assassinated by the coup heirs to power in Honduras). She did not care... she was going to continue to fight on for justice and for the people of Honduras who don't have Hillary an email away to shill for their interests (unlike the oligarchs)."
"3666","1460750718","Just in case anyone's interested in a more nuanced take, including arguments for why the coup was actually a legal transfer of power (though maybe carried out illegally) and the surprising fact that people on the right criticized Hillary at the time for *opposing* the new government, here's some stuff I pulled together in a discussion on another forum:

First, criticism from the [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204518504574423570828980800) for not supporting the coup/transfer of power:
&gt;Ever since Manuel Zelaya was removed from the Honduran presidency by that country's Supreme Court and Congress on June 28 for violations of the constitution, the Obama administration has insisted, without any legal basis, that the incident amounts to a ""coup d'état"" and must be reversed....""The administration is standing by its ""coup"" charge and 10 days ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went so far as to sanction the country's independent judiciary. The U.S. won't say why, but its clear the court's sin is rejecting a U.S.-backed proposal to restore Mr. Zelaya to power....""Since June 28, the U.S. has been pressuring Honduras to put Mr. Zelaya back in the presidency. But neither Mrs. Clinton's spurious ""rule of law"" claims or the tire iron handed her by Mr. Obama to use against this little country have been effective in convincing the Honduran judiciary that it ought to abandon its constitution.""

Then, apparently the idea that the removal of Zelaya from office (though not his exile from the country, and perhaps not the way it was done) was legal and constitutional has a lot of support. (So does the idea that it wasn't, of course.) Here are some examinations of it, pro and con: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27état#Legality_of_ouster), [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2009/0721/p09s02-wogn.html), [CNN](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-295913).

That last is by Miguel Estrada, whom some of you may remember as a George Bush nominee to the US Court of Appeals who was rejected for being a conservative ideologue. So take it with however much salt you need. He is Honduran himself, though, and that article offers the most detailed account of Zelaya's actions that allegedly led to his ouster."
"3667","1460765072","God damnit. Read Wiki on this people.

Honduras Supreme Court says stop, that's illegal, he doesn't stop.   
Honduras asks the US if they support ousting the guy trying to become dictator.  We say yes.  Honduras congress ousts him, has military escort him to airport and ban him from country.  
The guy replacing him then passes the legislation and makes himself dictator.

We have to break this cycle and with the president controlling the executive branch, not electing Clinton is the most effective way to do this. Sanders would crush in the general election and his willingness to say no to more irration action like what happened in Honduras can make more of a difference than most are willing to acknowledge."
"3669","1460744738","Not quite, here's a less biased view from the Washington Post:
""Instead of condemning the figures behind the uprising, suspending support to the illegitimate government of Zelaya’s successor, Roberto Micheletti, and demanding a restoration of the democratically elected Zelaya, Secretary Clinton decided to move on. In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region “to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.” The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya’s ouster.""

Most gold standard advocates don't realize how rich they would make India as a result, where gifts of gold are considered to be essential for marriage among hundreds of millions of people. China already outpaces the USA in gold production by a considerable margin, so using the metal as a standard with which to back currencies would give the Chinese the largest lever with which to control money supply.

"3754","1460843487","&gt;My question is- Couldn't these corporations just relocate their headquarters to another country with more lenient corporate tax policies, thus avoiding being taxed by the US altogether?

First, the rich [don't flee high-tax states](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/29/135813061/studies-rich-dont-flee-high-tax-states).  The same is true of countries.  There is a point at which wealthy people would leave a country due to high taxation, but simply raising taxes in a responsible way, as would be required for any bill to pass Congress, would not bring us to that level of taxation.

For example, he's proposing that income over $10 million - his highest proposed tax bracket - should be taxed at 52%.  For comparison, before Reagan's presidency in the early 80s, the highest tax bracket was taxed at 70%.  Reagan and Congress passed the [Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Recovery_Tax_Act_of_1981), which slashed the top tax bracket rate to 50%, just 2% less than what Sanders thinks it should be.  We had plenty of rich people in the 70s, 60s, and 50s.

Concerning corporations: Sanders has proposed policies that would save them money.  For example, he wants to replace health insurance with a Medicare For All single-payer system.  Health insurance premiums are one of the largest payroll expenses for US employers, even more so since Obamacare mandated health insurance for employees who work at least 30 hours per week.  A single-payer system would reduce healthcare costs by more equitably distributing the burden of paying for healthcare, removing the need to raise healthcare prices to make a profit for insurance company shareholders, and by giving the government more power to negotiate fair prices.

Next, when Sanders talks about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure improvements, like expanding public transit, fixing lead-contaminated water systems, and improving schools, he's talking about $1 trillion in federal contracts that would go to American companies.  Typically, such economic stimulus contracts require the contractors to purchase American-made parts and equipment when it is possible to do so.  That would be a massive business opportunity for American companies.

Raising the minimum wage would put more disposable income in people's pockets.  This would create more demand for products and services, which are business opportunities for providers of goods and services.  A strong middle class is the best engine for economic growth.  Providing the rich with low taxes won't cause them to open new businesses if there is not enough demand for their products.

From [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-100-economy-why-the-us-needs-a-strong-middle-class-to-thrive/257385/):

The...notion at the center of Hanauer's talk was that the innovators and businessmen are not, in fact, ""job creators""--that the fate of the economy rests instead in the hands of the middle class. So Hanauer wants to tax rich guys like himself more, to pay for investments to nurture middle-class families.

""We've had it backward for the last 30 years,"" Hanauer said at the TED conference. ""Rich businesspeople like me don't create jobs.

Finally, and perhaps the most important point, Bernie Sanders is going to have to work with Congress.  There is no possible Congress that would pass a tax increase that would destroy the economy.  Economists and business leaders differ about exactly how high taxes could go before they begin to damage the economy more than they help it - and a lot of that depends on what the taxes are spent on - but it is simply a fact that taxes on the wealthy could be higher than they are without damaging the economy.  What Sanders would hammer out with Congress remains to be seen, but it is unrealistic to assume that his agenda would be enacted without carefully examining the economic consequences and tailoring the tax rate to avoid unwarranted harm.

If that last part throws some people and makes them think that his agenda won't happen, remember that almost every other major country on earth has achieved healthcare for all.  We can do it too.  Also, look at how Obama's been treated by Congress - would Hillary be treated any better?  Realistically, any Democratic president is going to face a Congress that's unwilling to cooperate until 2018 at the earliest, with 2020 after redistricting being more likely.  And finally, it's not just about what Sanders wants to do, but also about what he wouldn't do.  He wouldn't get us into another regime-change war.  He wouldn't agree to something like cutting Social Security as part of a bargain with Republicans.  He wouldn't appoint a Supreme Court Justice who doesn't want to overturn Citizens United.

First, the rich [don't flee high-tax states](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/29/135813061/studies-rich-dont-flee-high-tax-states).  The same is true of countries.  There is a point at which wealthy people would leave a country due to high taxation, but simply raising taxes in a responsible way, as would be required for any bill to pass Congress, would not bring us to that level of taxation.

For example, he's proposing that income over $10 million - his highest proposed tax bracket - should be taxed at 52%.  For comparison, before Reagan's presidency in the early 80s, the highest tax bracket was taxed at 70%.  Reagan and Congress passed the [Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Recovery_Tax_Act_of_1981), which slashed the top tax bracket rate to 50%, just 2% less than what Sanders thinks it should be.  We had plenty of rich people in the 70s, 60s, and 50s.

Concerning corporations: Sanders has proposed policies that would save them money.  For example, he wants to replace health insurance with a Medicare For All single-payer system.  Health insurance premiums are one of the largest payroll expenses for US employers, even more so since Obamacare mandated health insurance for employees who work at least 30 hours per week.  A single-payer system would reduce healthcare costs by more equitably distributing the burden of paying for healthcare, removing the need to raise healthcare prices to make a profit for insurance company shareholders, and by giving the government more power to negotiate fair prices.

Next, when Sanders talks about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure improvements, like expanding public transit, fixing lead-contaminated water systems, and improving schools, he's talking about $1 trillion in federal contracts that would go to American companies.  Typically, such economic stimulus contracts require the contractors to purchase American-made parts and equipment when it is possible to do so.  That would be a massive business opportunity for American companies.

Raising the minimum wage would put more disposable income in people's pockets.  This would create more demand for products and services, which are business opportunities for providers of goods and services.  A strong middle class is the best engine for economic growth.  Providing the rich with low taxes won't cause them to open new businesses if there is not enough demand for their products.

From [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-100-economy-why-the-us-needs-a-strong-middle-class-to-thrive/257385/):

The...notion at the center of Hanauer's talk was that the innovators and businessmen are not, in fact, ""job creators""--that the fate of the economy rests instead in the hands of the middle class. So Hanauer wants to tax rich guys like himself more, to pay for investments to nurture middle-class families.

""We've had it backward for the last 30 years,"" Hanauer said at the TED conference. ""Rich businesspeople like me don't create jobs. Rather, they are a consequence of an ecosystemic feedback loop animated by middle-class consumers."" When the middle class thrives, he said, ""businesses grow and hire, and owners profit.""

-end quote-

Finally, and perhaps the most important point, Bernie Sanders is going to have to work with Congress.  There is no possible Congress that would pass a tax increase that would destroy the economy.  Economists and business leaders differ about exactly how high taxes could go before they begin to damage the economy more than they help it - and a lot of that depends on what the taxes are spent on - but it is simply a fact that taxes on the wealthy could be higher than they are without damaging the economy.  What Sanders would hammer out with Congress remains to be seen, but it is unrealistic to assume that his agenda would be enacted without carefully examining the economic consequences and tailoring the tax rate to avoid unwarranted harm.

If that last part throws some people and makes them think that his agenda won't happen, remember that almost every other major country on earth has achieved healthcare for all.  We can do it too.  Also, look at how Obama's been treated by Congress - would Hillary be treated any better?  Realistically, any Democratic president is going to face a Congress that's unwilling to cooperate until 2018 at the earliest, with 2020 after redistricting being more likely.  And finally, it's not just about what Sanders wants to do, but also about what he wouldn't do.  He wouldn't get us into another regime-change war.  He wouldn't agree to something like cutting Social Security as part of a bargain with Republicans.  He wouldn't appoint a Supreme Court Justice who doesn't want to overturn Citizens United.  He wouldn't let white collar crimes committed by powerful CEOs go unpunished.  He wouldn't use the DEA to crush the legalized and medical marijuana vendors in states that voted to allow it."
"3765","1460843471","Bernie can withhold public contracts and subsidies unless they meet certain requirements. The problem is the government knows about and encourages the tax evasion while also giving them preferential treatment when it comes to contracts, subsidies and legislation that favors them. That's what the whole corruption accusation is about at its core"
"3766","1460843866","Bernie would appoint a supreme court justice which could help overturn the Citizen's United ruling, and help get big money out of politics.  With that done, things would be easier.

Regardless of going the supreme court route, fixing campaign finance will be one of his primary goals."
"3767","1460844742","As far as paying off politicians, direct bribery is illegal, lobbyists offer campaign financing in exchange for political favors, and campaign finance reform is a major goal of his.

And to that end, lobbying is a significant cost to industries, but less so than they think they stand to lose without it. If simply moving out of the country would free them, that'd be the cheaper alternative. Even the Saudis hire lobbyists.

In a similar parallel, donating to PACs to elect politicians who will lower or not change the tax rate on the wealthy is also a significant cost, but less so than they feel they stand to lose. Expatriating would be a cheaper alternative, and the wealthy do it now anyways. The biggest factor in play is the willingness to move all of one's life and business to another country in order to not be flagged in by the IRS's Substantial Presence Test. (You can read more [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-rich-people-move-to-low-tax-countries-to-get-richer), that's what I was summarizing)

America's a massive consumer economy, and stands to grow larger as the minimum wage increases, and there's not much penalty to leaving because free trade agreements don't interrupt access to that economy. The problem's not simple, but you can summarize it concisely: there's very little to protect America from the whim and will of the wealthy."

Single payer healthcare
Marijuana decriminalization

Breaking up the big banks
Israel commits disproportionate violence and we should treat both sides with respect 
Campaign contribution corrupt politicians
Overthrowing regimes in ME and Latin America has lead to mass instability in these regions

Condemned large corporations for not paying taxes
Gone against free trade policies
Talking about the consequences and mistakes of the Iraq war
Talking about mass incarceration and criminal justice reform

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window. I highly doubt that a candidate like Clinton will be elected again, but who knows

"3972","1460757286","&gt;Hillary’s own director of policy planning, Anne-Marie Slaughter urged her to “find that [the] coup was a ‘military coup’ under U.S. law and revoke the visas of more de facto regime members...high level people from both the business and the NGO community say that even our friends are beginning to think we are not really committed to the norm of constitutional democracy.”

It's so hard to tell what's really going on at a geopolitical level, but Hillary's legitimization of the new Honduran regime just seems super suspect to me.

Many other countries refused to recognize the post-coup government and refused, in protest, to observe the quick fix ""free election"" Hillary negotiated.  

Our allies wanted nothing to do with the election, because it was a sham - 

&gt;While observers were touched by the commitment, courage and enthusiasm of the many Hondurans who participated in this process in good faith, they were also saddened by the numerous discrepancies, lack of preparedness and resources, bribery, voter intimidation, violence and fraud that they witnessed. According to Dale Sorenson of the Task Force on the Americas, the observations documented in the delegation report “demonstrate a clear pattern of systematic undermining of the Honduran people’s right to a free and fair election.”  http://afgj.org/honduras-election-monitoring-report

and

&gt;""On election day, November 29, there were a number of incidents that confirmed the climate of repression in which the electoral process took place, which represented the consolidation of the coup d'etat of June 28th."" Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL)

And, seems the coup was successful - http://fpif.org/anatomy-election-fraud-stealing-2013-honduran-election-five-simple-steps/

EDIT:  Now I think about it, there are only 2 possibilities

1) HC had some conflict of interest to support the coup leaders. I can't begin to guess what but I guess Obama did too, since ultimately it was his call.  

2) HC was naive enough to think the leaders of a coup would be sure to run a free and fair election.  Or, let's say it wasn't a coup, she was naive enough to think the kind of people who would issue a secret warrant, arrest the elected President in the middle of the night in his pajamas and extradite him in violation of their own constitution would be sure to run a free and fair elections.

"
"3973","1460770154","This is a repost about the US involvement in regime change in Honduras -   
  
&gt;Dude, it's Honduras. They have by far the highest homicide rate out of any country in the world. More than half as many people are murdered there per year than in the United States, even though their population is only 8.5 million. Their GDP per capita is about $2400 per year, making them one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere.  
  

&gt;Honduras wasn't going to turn into a utopia if the US government cut off much needed aid, which was not required by law, because it was not a military coup, and normal constitutional and electoral function resumed very quickly afterwards. The supreme court was legally entitled to order the president out of office.
  
  
&gt;The real goal in a situation like that is to avoid a civil war, which was a very real possibility. And if the US had taken a strong stance against the new government, and war broke out, they would have been obligated to intervene. That point cannot be stressed enough.
  
  
&gt;To drive that point home, I will give you an example of how you can really fuck that kind of thing up.
  
  
&gt;At the end of the Gulf War in 1991, anybody that had anything to do with the military or foreign relations in the US government was badly in need of a vacation. Thousands people who normally work 40 hours a week had been working 70 hours a week for six months, and more than half a million US military personnel had been in full war mode for even longer.
  
  
&gt;Time to take a breather, right?
  
  
&gt;Wrong. Really wrong.
  
  
&gt;At that exact point in history, the USSR was collapsing. So no time off for anyone.
And in that context, the US made some rather subtle mistakes in their messaging, which is understandable. Unfortunately, as a result, the Iraqi Kurds got the impression that the US would support them of they rose up against Saddam.   
  
  
&gt;But the coalition had avoided invading Iraq precisely because they had achieved their objectives, and didn't want to get caught up in Iraq's ethnic squabbles.
  
  
&gt;The Kurdish uprising was subsequently brutally crushed.
  
  
&gt;It was a lesson for future US administrations. If you give even tacit support for a resistance movement, they might expect you to help them.
  
  
&gt;So when Honduras happened, they kept their mouths shut, and maintained the status quo.
Since you are clearly passionate about this (which I appreciate) I would ask you what you would have done if you were the president of the US when that happened.
  
  
&gt;Keep in mind that at that exact moment, the following things were demanding attention and resources from the Whitehouse:
  
  
&gt;-There were 135,000 troops in Iraq. There were also 50,000 in Afghanistan, where the violence was spiralling out of control.
  
  
&gt;-The global financial crisis was still a huge issue, and the US economy was struggling badly. People were abandoning their homes in large numbers, and tent cities were becoming a common sight in major cities.

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "

Sorry but when you are a president you are supposed to be the leader and others should follow you and not the other way around. This is something I miss in Hillary. She hardly ever takes the initiative and just goes with the flow (also applicable on her stands towards most important progressive topics). 

Another trait of a good leader is taking the blame when it is yours to take and not blame somebody else for the mistakes you made! Yesterday in debate you could clearly see she that she doesn't understand this (she solely blamed Obama for some mistakes she was as much responsible for.

"4083","1460724998","The reason Bernie is winning, is because he cares. He doesn't act like a politician, he acts like a human. Great movements in America have always required being human before being a politician. Hillary is getting huge sums of money for being a Clinton.  She says she represents the people,  but she isn't talking about her ideas. She criticizes Bernie's ideas, and tries to find loopholes. When I watch her, it almost seems like she is arguing in court trying to use long articulated sentences while replying to simple questions.   She acts like what's done is done, and that these changes Bernie speaks of shouldn't be attempted.  In the 1700s, England was in its prime, and mighty.  The colonists were at their mercy, yet they stood up, and fought for what they believed in despite the situation being ""imlossible."" When Lincoln dropped the emancipation proclamation on the world, much of the United States didn't support this, he was even assassinated.  Here we are now.  To us common plebs it just appears as though Clinton is running for office because she wants to add that to her biography.   Sanders wants to/acts like he wants to make a difference. "

"4086","1460726607","I don't understand why people think Hillary is a good debater. She's a poor rhetorician in a number of ways: her voice is shrill; her rhythm is flat; and her expression swings from serious to bemused to annoyed to offended. She also tends to dissemble. A lot. You see it when she begins a sentence with, ""I've always"" or ""my entire life"" or ""I've never"". It's simply not possible for a person to have always held a simple position on a complex issue such as the second amendment, social security, abortion. There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur."" The only aspect of debate that she excels is in details of foreign policy. She was SoS after all. "

"4089","1460739546","I like how the main issue anyone has with Bernie is that he doesn't have a fully laid out plan on how to handle certain situations.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

"4092","1460753518","I have a question and am hoping that someone can help me understand better since I'm not too big on politics.

Why is it seen as a negative that Bernie Sanders couldn't specify differences between his and Trump's stance on NATO? If anything, to me, it shows that this is one issue that both parties can agree to cooperate and actually do something about since their beliefs are similar on this topic.

I personally don't think that because Bernie Sanders agrees with one side of the republican policies, that democrats should see that as a negative. To me, thats a positive. It shows someone finally thinking outside of the box and being open minded instead of trying to progress this country baby steps at a time the way Hillary wants.

"4093","1460732819","how exactly did he ""win"" last night? he had a rubio moment when hillary pointed out that she wanted to take steps to address climate change while bernie has failed to even take a first step in the senate. ""we have a crisis! we have a crisis! we have a crisis!""

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."
"4094","1460761248","This article perfectly sums up why I'm so torn between the two of them.

&gt;It's that in the history of political rhetoric, no one has ever been inspired by a pragmatist...What Sanders has going for him is that Democrats want to believe in his vision. And when people are asked to choose between their dreams and hard realities, they tend to pick their dreams.

I'm a fairly realistic person so to pragmatism of Hillary really speaks to me. But on the other hand, part of me really wonders if we need someone with Sander's type of grandiose vision to really push the US to make meaningful progressive change, even if he fails to accomplish his goals in the long term (which is what is most likely in my opinion)."

"4111","1460840419","It might help to clarify what is actually occurring - and why it is occurring.

As nations industrialize, labor demands get more complex.  Where once it was sufficient to have a willing attitude and a strong back, now laborers need a decent mind to go with it.  They need to learn and apply more complex, narrow skill sets.

But as other nations also move through this process, they start at the low end first - and are able to deliver the low end labor far more efficiently.  As a result, there is minimal demand in the more developed nations for low end labor.

However, there are still *people* at the low end, without the specialized skills they'd need to get better jobs.

Effectively, there is a 'gap' in the labor market where many people fall but no jobs exist.  So those people are forced into the unskilled labor market.

If you raise the minimum wage, you can close this gap somewhat.  But you do so at the expense of the people who would ordinarily be in the unskilled labor market (as opposed to being defaulted into by lack of slightly-more-skilled jobs).  Moreover, the slightly-more-skilled class is still 'underutilized' since they're just getting paid a bit more to do unskilled labor jobs rather than jobs that match their abilities.

Some of those people can potentially be retrained to get them 'past the gap' and into decent jobs.  But, frankly, most of them are either unwilling or unable to make that transition.  They're stuck in a world where the jobs that match their abilities are done by foreigners and all the jobs that are left either exceed their abilities or aren't worth their time.

To make matters worse, raising the minimum wage also encourages the *elimination* of those low-end jobs via automation.  So while you can potentially employ some of those 'gap' workers at jobs they really shouldn't be doing in the first place for semi-decent wages, you're throwing even more people out of work.

I don't believe anyone has come up with a particularly 'good' fix for this problem.  Raising the minimum wage is almost strictly worse than a policy such as guaranteed basic income due to the job-killing impact it has.  Better early education could potentially pay off - if anyone could figure out how to actually deliver it to poor people.  Easier adult trade education/re-education might help out, but there are limits.

But most of the proposals we're seeing from politicians fit nicely into the ""simple, easy and wrong"" category - such as minimum wage increases."

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

- What the hell is with Bernie's taxes? There is tons and tons of precedent for candidates releasing all of their taxes. Why is he being so shady about it? His excuses are lame and shouldn't be accepted"
"4224","1460733173","It wasn't that good TBH. Sanders was solid, but so was Hillary. She destroyed him at one point on how he couldn't get any of his own legislation passed, but he got her in other areas. She killed him on the questions about power tho"
"4225","1460731742","No, it was basically a tie.  A tie isn't enough right now.  What killed him was not being able to tie Clinton taking money from Wall Street to any actions she has done.  "
"4226","1460751991","﻿ I have disagreed with Paul Krugman's blogs about Bernie Sanders--his faulty analysis of the Daily News interview, and his sneering depiction of Sanders at every turn as in ""the revolutionary isn't cute any more."" His inability to say anything positive about the man, such as his passion, vision, his consistency, his strength in Congress sponsoring and co-sponsoring bills (across the aisle and with Sec. Clinton), his resonance with many, many voters, any of his policies. This indicates to me not reasoned, authentic political thinking, but a smear campaign. But today Paul Krugman and I agree on something. I found it deeply disturbing that in the Brooklyn debate last night that Sanders reiterated his remark that he lost the South because it's conservative. He lost among African American voters. His remark effectively dismisses them as conservatives, and that's a problem. I don't think the remark accurately reflects his positions and actions concerning systemic racism in this country. But he should hear the problem in his remark and stop saying it, and say why he was wrong to say it. I have been pondering why many African Americans in the Southern primaries (including in my small Virginian town) voted for Clinton. Of course, there are multiple reasons and points of view. But I don't think it has been conservativism. And I don't think it's necessarily affection for the Clintons. People I know said, ""She's electable."" I think African American voters deeply understand the gravity of the situation, more than most white voters probably. A white friend in a predominantly Black union in Philadelphia said that when she asked the question, people said, ""Bernie who?"" The longer the campaign goes on, the more people will be able to answer that question. But Bernie Sanders needs to understand what's wrong with calling a predominantly African American vote (in my town almost all Democrats are Black and almost all Republicans are white) ""conservative."" And he needs to fix it, publicly."
"4227","1460753760","I watched the debate and I am blown away by Sanders.  He did amazing and I want to do everything I can to support him.

She is a crook."

&gt;It's not absurd for the average person to wonder why stockholders would agree to pay huge amounts of compensation to those who can't turn a profit.

&gt; The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also won’t explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

&gt; ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

&gt; ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

&gt; Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldn’t get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

Nides was also involved in the [scandal](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/12/ethics_complaint_seeks_to_uncover_facts_in_hillary_influencepeddling_scandal.html) involving Clinton’s efforts to provide special access to State Department officials for hedge fund clients of her son-in-law, Marc Mezinsky.

Wow.

"4323","1460750890","&gt;Judicial Watch announced today it has obtained new documents from the Department of State containing the telephone transcripts from the evening of September 11, 2012, in which then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informs then-Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil that the deadly terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi “had nothing to do with the film.”  The documents include previously unreleased telephone transcripts with world leaders about the Benghazi attack.

&gt;Clinton’s admission to Kandil was first produced to the Select Committee on Benghazi on October 13, 2015 and publicized on the day of Mrs. Clinton’s testimony, October 22, but court filings in Judicial Watch litigation show that the record was only produced after two federal court judges ordered the State Department to produce more Benghazi-related records to Judicial Watch.  Similarly, Judicial Watch litigation also forced the release of the September 11, 2012 email in which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed her daughter by email that the attack had been staged by an “Al Qaeda-like group,” rather than as the result of “inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” as Mrs. Clinton had claimed in her official public statement one hour earlier."

"4331","1460750972","what is it proving? are you kidding me, she said it was a video to all the families of the dead they went on talk shows and said it was a video they said it was a video for weeks when they knew it was a planed attack the next day. who gave the stand down order that killed our people that's what we want to know

Well for one it puts the lie to her claims that Benghazi was touched off by the video, which is what she and her envoys preached for weeks afterward, including to the families of the dead.

At 10:08 p.m. on September 11, Mrs. Clinton issued an official State Department press statement, approved by the White House, placing the blame for the attack on an Internet video:

...

Yet the next day, in her 7:49 PM September 12 conversation with 
Kandil, Clinton said, “We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do 
with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest.” Kandil 
responded, “You’re not kidding. Based on the information we saw today we
believe that group that claimed responsibility for this is affiliated 
with al-Qaeda.”

So by the very next evening she was talking to world leaders and telling them they knew it wasn't about a video. It was terrorism, straight up. But they changed the talking points to hide the terrorism angle because it was an election year and Obama had been running on the platform that al Qaeda and other terror orgs were ""on the run.""

It was a baldfaced lie told to the American people, and it was told so Obama could retain the White House and Hillary could still pretend that Libya was a feather in her cap for 2016, instead of a miserable failure."
"4332","1460828659","So it turns out Obama AND Hillary lied to the American people through their teeth.

Why?

Could it be because it was in the middle of the election and Obama wanted the public to believe Al-Qaeda was not a major threat?"

We know that in those speeches she definitely did not go and tell them to cut it out. Before Sanders and Trump, taking money from Wall Street was just par for the course. Everyone on the GOP did it and Hillary probably did it less than all of them, so it was no big deal. But then Sanders and Trump came around, and all of a sudden those speeches became completely toxic. 

So I am pretty sure that is exactly the smoking gun we are looking for. Not like secret promises to work with them for favors or anything. But like, ""you guys are heroes, you help drive this economy and are a big reason why America is the great country that it is."" Stuff like that.

I personally don't think that is in there, cause she is a lawyer by trade and would not do something so stupid. If there is a Freudian slip, which is entirely possible, then she is in some real shit. 

Here is my biggest worry. Those speeches were pretty public events, each had thousands of people attending, and she made a lot of them. So it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a recording out there somewhere. this is completely expected. I am worried that someone is waiting to release them in the general election. I know trump would put up a million dollar bounty for a recording, and frankly i think they are sitting on one already. 

This combined with the active FBI investigation into her emails which already shows she has been at least careless with classified material. We are just waiting to see if that carelessness adds up to negligence or gross negligence.

 That's why she just tosses out a lame excuse she knows will be unpopular. Because she knows that not releasing them can only possibly hurt her so much, and right now it's about as much as it can get. But releasing them, regardless of their contents, opens up the floodgates for *new* controversy"

Which means that it's the third:  It's a powerful problem, and they're not letting it go, lest it wrecks the campaign... which itself will wreck the campaign because it won't be ignored or forgotten. 

If she thinks that the GOP, much less Bernie, is gonna let that slide... yeah, that's just dumb hope on her part.

I think it's bad news for her campaign, honestly.  But the only way to know is to get 'em out there."
"4387","1460793148","We pretty much know what Hillary said in those speeches. [Various people who attended those private speeches has been interviewed by the media, and they described those speeches as the gushy.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/clinton-speeches-218969) Some reported that she sound like a managing director. We know that in those speeches she definitely did not go and tell them to cut it out. Before Sanders and Trump, taking money from Wall Street was just par for the course. Everyone on the GOP did it and Hillary probably did it less than all of them, so it was no big deal. But then Sanders and Trump came around, and all of a sudden those speeches became completely toxic. 

So I am pretty sure that is exactly the smoking gun we are looking for. Not like secret promises to work with them for favors or anything. But like, ""you guys are heroes, you help drive this economy and are a big reason why America is the great country that it is."" Stuff like that. Empty platitudes in the past, but will sink her campaign now. We know that is at least in there, and that is probably good enough. 

If she say anything about running for president or become the future president, that is illegal and we can pack up and go home. I personally don't think that is in there, cause she is a lawyer by trade and would not do something so stupid. If there is a Freudian slip, which is entirely possible, then she is in some real shit. 

Here is my biggest worry. Those speeches were pretty public events, each had thousands of people attending, and she made a lot of them. So it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a recording out there somewhere. this is completely expected. I am worried that someone is waiting to release them in the general election. I know trump would put up a million dollar bounty for a recording, and frankly i think they are sitting on one already. 

This combined with the active FBI investigation into her emails which already shows she has been at least careless with classified material. We are just waiting to see if that carelessness adds up to negligence or gross negligence. 

The amount of risk the DNC is taking with Hillary is unimaginable with anyone else. Frankly it is amazing the democratic establishment has allowed it to get this far. "

"
"4391","1460783973","I'd say it's fairly likely, otherwise why not simply release the transcripts? We already know that in prior speeches she blamed the ""irresponsible borrowers"" for the 2008 crash rather than the banks buying bad loans that they knew were made by predatory loan officers. I can't imagine the rest of her speeches are really that good.

Even if she was just blowing smoke up their asses, it won't appear that way to the public."
"4392","1460785667","At this point all the damage that can be dealt from her not releasing them has been dealt.

 And if she does release them, even if there's nothing particularly damming in them, literally every single word will be pried apart and any sentence in any context that could possibly be construed as ""bad"" will be prime ammunition against her, even if it's not that big of a deal.

Releasing them now, regardless of what's in them, would be a strategically unsound move for that reason.

 That's why she just tosses out a lame excuse she knows will be unpopular. Because she knows that not releasing them can only possibly hurt her so much, and right now it's about as much as it can get. But releasing them, regardless of their contents, opens up the floodgates for *new* controversy"
"4393","1460785279","You don't continue to withhold and make ridiculous requirements in order to release them without there being something damaging on them. There is no other logical reason to withhold them at this point. She was booed on stage. She has to be aware of the negativity she is getting from them.

The real action occurs in the private one-on-one conversations  afterwards in the mixers. Thats why you pay the big buck to attend or have the person there: access. The speech is just puffery.  "
"4396","1460786021","It's illegal to give paid speeches if you're running for president. If in one of those speeches she said something to the effect of 'she'll protect the banks when she's elected' she is fucking done."

But I flat-out refuse to vote for her when she acts so smarmy about every detail of her personal affairs.  Fair or not, it reeks of corruption and entitlement."
"4398","1460784099","There's no point in giving Bernie ammo that plays right into his stump speech rhetoric, especially when she's clearly winning.

She got paid the same amount to give speeches to Ebay, Beth El Synagogue, and *The American Camping Association*, but no one is clamoring for those.  It's people latching on to the Bernie ""Wall Street = automatically in league with the anti-Christ"" logic.

It's cliche corporate retreat fluff where they pay a big name to come wow people with his/her life story and throw some cheap compliments to the employees there.

She knows if she releases the Wall Street related ones every platitude is going to parsed and twisted out of context.

Or if you are on r/politics you think they were literal 225k bribes and Hillary and Goldman Sachs were all sitting in a room laughing at poor people for two hours."
"4399","1460786245","The truth is what's in the transcripts is more damaging than not releasing them ever will be. Speculate what's in them all you want. Releasing them would sink her and and the party establishment. So it's really damned if you do and kinda damned if you don't."
"4400","1460783867","This is the Sanders Campaign's ""Benghazi"".

It's straight out of the GOP playbook:

* Trey Gowdy:  Release all your emails to us so we can comb through them for stuff we can use against you in the election - and if you refuse, we will say it's because you are hiding something.

* Bernie Sanders: Release all your speeches to us so we can comb  through them for stuff we can use against you in the election - and if you refuse, we will say it's because you are hiding something.

It's a red herring.  

Wall Street companies pay famous people to give talks.

Goldman Sachs puts on dozens of these every year.  Recently they paid Shaquille O'Neil and Deepak Chopra to speak.

So ""interesting"" people appear on the stage and spout a little generic pablum about 'being your best' or 'the challenging world we live in'.  

Everyone applauds politely and heads to the free buffet and open bar.

Does anyone REALLY think Clinton said ""Give me money, and I will do whatever you tell me to""?

No, the Sanders campaign, like the GOP Benghazi committee is just looking for a couple of ""gotcha"" sentences they can take out of context and use to try to keep her from winning the election.

"
"4401","1460783446","There's no way of knowing without her releasing them. She likely doesn't see a need right now as she is likely going to beat Sanders without doing so.

Then the oil crash began and the Saudis deliberately did not cut production in order to try and kill their competition which in turn helped cause the current global economic slowdown.

Our job is two-fold, mainly: 

1.) to keep the pressure on and keep talking about these subjects and not let the media push them into the shadows again.
2.) to aggressively challenge any and all voter dis-enfranchisements. Voting should be a constitutional right! Americans should have the right to vote in a fair process free of party corruptions, free of gerrymandering, and free of false choices between 'lesser of two evils'. How to accomplish that technically?

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.  
e.) All states should switch to vote by mail.
f.) Each ballot should have a durable carbon copy record for auditing purposes that shall remain legible at least 10 years in the humid Southeast.
g.) Vote tallying or counting machines must be audited regularly and rigorously using statistical sampling. "

Citing hundreds of thousands of annual marijuana arrests, racial and economic disparities in marijuana enforcement, and the role of prohibition in keeping marijuana prices high and lucrative to violent drug dealers, the physicians say that creating a legal and regulated marijuana market is the best way to ensure public safety, combat the illicit drug trade and roll back the negative consequences of strict enforcement policies on disadvantaged communities."

Why should she have to prove herself to be more pure than the entire political system? She has played by the rules and now all of a sudden the electorate wants to change the rules? 

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change. 

If I could give Hillary one piece of advice, it would be this: Forget about yourself, remember America."

Voters are realizing they're hearing the same shit over and over, and it's not a direct answer to the question. Whatever is on those transcript, if they exist at all, at this point doesn't even matter. The fact that she doesn't have a direct answer is a full display of a lack of integrity.

I'll offer one thing further. Are guns designed to primarily kill people with malicious intent? If a gun manufacturer primarily makes their weapons as a product intended for defense of life and property, does that hurt the ""designed to kill people, therefore culpable"" argument?"

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

"4931","1460703012","You can almost understand what she is saying: *if a left-wing Dem congress put a $15 federal minimum wage bill on her desk*, she would sign it. But she doesn't believe the political will is there, so she won't advocate or fight for it, because that's not ""pragmatic"" or politically viable.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

The Clinton revolution was basically founded on ""New Dems"" newfound role as hippie punchers, so triangulating against a hippie is making Hillary sound increasingly schizophrenic."
"4932","1460692526","She looked so bad in this answer because it truly seemed like she was trying to mislead people into thinking she's for a $15 federal minimum wage. If that's not what you're for just explain your stance please."
"4933","1460719015","it seemed like a fairly straight forward answer. Her stance is to push for a federal minimum of $12. If a bill somehow passes for $15, she is more than happy to sign it. 

But the bill she would put forward to congress if there isn't already legislation in the works, is $12"
"4934","1460692438","Hilary is very confusing and obtuse in her answers."
"4935","1460694201","At least she gave a long diatribe on why @12 minimum is a step toward $15.  She couldn't give one reason for why she would oppose breaking up big banks.  Instead she refused to answer the question, repeatedly.  Then she claimed that it wasn't ""fair"" to ask her to release her $200,000  Wall St. speech transcripts because the ""other candidate"" won't.  We all know Bernie has no Wall St speeches but she is pretending otherwise. She will say anything no matter how ridiculous to win. "
"4936","1460723100","You have to be pretty dense to not understand her minimum wage argument. 12 as a baseline and a push for 15 in places that can handle economically. How is that hard?"
"4937","1460721331","Not confusing if you understand how the world works. Same with converting to renewables. You have to make huge changes in phases, otherwise you get very bad side effects.  You can't just jack up minimum wage to 15 everywhere (nor should you as the cost of living in Manhattan and San Francisco is WAY different from places like Alabama and Montana ) immediately without bad consquences."
"4938","1460705894","There was nothing confusing about it at all. She's in favor of a federal, nationwide minimum wage of $12. She's in favor of higher minimum wages in states and cities like New York where the cost of living is higher."
"4939","1460709046","Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"
"4940","1460715245","I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."
"4941","1460720963","The answer seems weird but it makes sense when you consider how hard it is to get any legislation to the desk of the president. I'm sure Hillary's first choice would be a $12 national minimum wage, but if congress were to pass a $15 dollar one I'm sure she wouldn't veto it. It makes perfect sense."
"4942","1460725471","I'm a Bernie supporter, but this is where I agree with Clinton. I believe $12 is a fair minimum wage nationally. Some areas like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco need more. However, I think $15 nationally is too high. Some 15 year old kid in bumfuck Nebraska doesn't need $15 an hour. It could dry up jobs and push automation along faster."
"4943","1460721217","Minimum wage hikes hurt small businesses. Makes sense that a local place out in the countryside wouldn't have to pay as much, even more so since living in the country is cheaper."
"4944","1460729765","So the REAL answer is NO.  She does not support a $15 minimal.  She supports $12, but isn't willing to say that, because that $3 could cost her some votes. "
"4945","1460733003","It's not that she was inarticulate. She was trying to say something technically correct that would still mislead a casual listener to believing she favors a $15/hr minimum wage. She did the same shit with her answer about carbon taxing, and a similar thing with her nonanswer about whether Israel's bombing of Gaza was disproportionate (a fair yes or no question).

 She doesn't even want to say clearly what she believes when it's about a divisive issue because any clear answer is bound to piss off some group of people, so she mealy mouths her answers and tries to have it both ways. It's goddamn infuriating to listen to."
"4946","1460714202","What's so confusing? It was pretty clear: if you support the $15 min wage, then I support the $15 min wage, if you support the $12 min wage, them I support the $12 min wage.

It's very much in line with the rest of her platform: I support whatever gets me more votes."
"4947","1460695682","This is a clear example of HRC displaying her moderate tendencies. She touts herself as a ""progressive that likes to get things done"", but she simply whiffed on her confusing answer. 

Raising the minimum wage to $15 is the one of answers* to the growing welfare problem. If all these people making minimum wage of $7.25/hr and  receiving welfare benefits are making $15/hr, it disqualifies them for many welfare programs.

Edit* changed from the one answer"

He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;    The evidence suggests that if there is police racial bias in arrests it is negligible. Victim and witness surveys show that police arrest violent criminals in close proportion to the rates at which criminals of different races commit violent crimes.

&gt;    There are dramatic race differences in crime rates. Asians have the lowest rates, followed by whites, and then Hispanics. Blacks have notably high crime rates. This pattern holds true for virtually all crime categories and for virtually all age groups.

&gt;    In 2013, a black was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder, and 12 times more likely to murder someone of another race than to be murdered by someone of another race.

&gt;    In 2013, of the approximately 660,000 crimes of interracial violence that involved blacks and whites, blacks were the perpetrators 85 percent of the time. This meant a black person was 27 times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. A Hispanic was eight times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa.

&gt;    In 2014 in New York City, a black was 31 times more likely than a white to be arrested for murder, and a Hispanic was 12.4 times more likely. For the crime of “shooting” — defined as firing a bullet that hits someone — a black was 98.4 times more likely than a white to be arrested, and a Hispanic was 23.6 times more likely.

&gt;    If New York City were all white, the murder rate would drop by 91 percent, the robbery rate by 81 percent, and the shootings rate by 97 percent.

&gt;    In an all-white Chicago, murder would decline 90 percent, rape by 81 percent, and robbery by 90 percent.

&gt;    In 2015, a black person was 2.45 times more likely than a white person to be shot and killed by the police. A Hispanic person was 1.21 times more likely. These figures are well within what would be expected given race differences in crime rates and likelihood to resist arrest.

&gt;    In 2015, police killings of blacks accounted for approximately 4 percent of homicides of blacks. Police killings of unarmed blacks accounted for approximately 0.6 percent of homicides of blacks. The overwhelming majority of black homicide victims (93 percent from 1980 to 2008) were killed by blacks.

&gt;    Both violent and non-violent crime has been declining in the United States since a high in 1993. 2015 saw a disturbing rise in murder in major American cities that some observers associated with “depolicing” in response to intense media and public scrutiny of police activity.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro–stupid shit?’ ”The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit.

How is someone living paycheck to paycheck supposed to get the time off, childcare, etc. to go vote in three different primaries?

"5086","1460696263","Sounds like NY should fix its' system if independent voters are to be allowed to vote for a republican or democrat of their choice.
Also libertarian and green party candidates should be able to compete and people should be able to vote for them in a primary election too. 

Get busy NY. Come up with a better voting system. "

"5091","1460747105","I see no reason why any primary elections should be open.  If you want to have a say in a party's election process just register with them.  Many states allow you to do it over the internet and if not you probably don't have to go far out of your way to do it."
"5092","1460696396","I don't see why non-members should have any particular say in who an organization chooses as their representative. Anyone can become a member of the Democratic party for free, that hardly qualifies as 'keeping the voters powerless' . "
"5093","1460747846","So the DNC, a private organization that can choose their nominee however the fuck it wants, decides to only allow democrats to vote so republicans and independents can't fuck up the process, and people complain?  

The sense of entitlement is sickening.  They could have just chosen a nominee and bypasses having primaries and caucuses altogether.  The caucus system shuts out people who don't have hours to spare but I hardly saw any complaining here because it benefitted Sanders.  The hypocrisy is incredible.  "
"5094","1460736782","So now we're going to actually question the state deadline instead of just laughing and calling Trump's children incompetent for not switching to Republican in time. Why aren't we calling these 3 million people incompetent? Hypocrisy. "

"5096","1460705452","Welcome to the political realities of America. It's all very extremely unfortunate, and yet a lesson at the same time.

But the problem is that merely wishing or pointing out how absurd it is does nothing to change it. What does change it is knowing these rules, and then voting in spite of them. The only way these rules will ever change is to know them, follow them, and then vote for candidates who promote something simpler, something more democratic, something more open. The only way voting will *ever* become a national holiday, is if enough voters without a national holiday demand one. Pointing out the flaws isn't enough, nor was it ever enough. Sitting there with high-minded principles does nothing.

Now a cult of ""Christians"" want to rewrite history. The man who wrote -all men are created equal-owned 100 slaves. Total hypocrite, not some angel from heaven establishing God's country. Our founders wanted the soldier's, and the king's taxes, out. It was not about establishing a Christian nation. They drank, they whored, they swore. They were men. Normal men.

Ted Cruz however scares me shitless. It would be a step backwards to elect him. We'd have more religious tension discrimination than we already do. Even as a conservative leaning voter, i would never vote for Cruz. I'm economically/fiscally conservative but socially liberal. And Ted Cruz is the exact opposite. He's like Hillary Clinton except he wants to carpet bomb places is Iraq, ban gay marriage &amp;amp; abortion.

If we let a republican president replace Scalia and Ginsberg, we can look forward to a reversal of Roe v Wade, reversal of gay marriage, overturn of the ACA, final destruction of unions and indivduals' rights to due process, and supremacy of business above all to an irreversible level."

I'm sure he understands that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress aren't exactly his biggest supporters so he would have to somehow appeal to both in order to get anything done.  However, the thought of Ted Cruz potentially making a Supreme Court nomination to a Republican controlled Congress is a future I don't want to have to deal with so at that point, I will begrudgingly give Hillary my vote if it means stopping Ted."

"5258","1460916025","HERNIE PANDERS"
"5259","1460904681","MSM has been so, so disingenuous on this issue. Sanders is clearly against allowing military style weapons being sold to civilians as well as being in favour of holding makers/sellers liable for manufacturer's defects and wrongful selling practices. He is entirely against immunity under these circumstances but they are taking the part where he stipulates that outside of these circumstances you should *not* be able to sue and presenting it as if he's still saying that you shouldn't be able to sue at all. It's amazing how many people I've spoken to had no idea about this incredibly important distinction. Clinton's stance is actually the fucked up one in that she wants to allow people to sue under *any* circumstances. One of the simplest analogies of her stance is you'd be able to sue a hammer company if you were injured by someone attacking you with a hammer.

Edit: [Source:](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-gun-policy/)

&gt; Manufacturer Liability: Gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the misuse of their products, just as any other industry isn’t held accountable for how end-consumers use their products.

&gt; Bernie believes that gun control is largely a state issue because attitudes and actions with regards to firearms differ greatly between rural and urban communities. Nevertheless, Bernie believes there are situations where the federal government should intervene. **He voted in favor of requiring background checks to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of felons and the mentally ill, passing a federal ban on assault weapons, and closing loopholes which allows private sellers at gun shows and on the internet to sell to individuals without background checks.**

&gt; To what extent does Bernie believe that gun regulation should be a federal issue?

&gt; Bernie has voted in favor of a nationwide ban on assault weapons, a nationwide ban on high-capacity magazines of over ten rounds, and nationwide expanded background checks that address unsafe loopholes.

[Sanders supporting Sandy Hook lawsuit:] (http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/14/politics/transcript-democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/)

&gt; BLITZER: So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?

&gt; SANDERS: No, I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. **They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.**

[Sandy hook lawsuit:] (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36050659)

&gt; The suit argues that the semi-automatic rifle used in the school shooting is a military weapon and should not have been sold to civilians.

Great, so now Bernie is against the domestic manufacture of AR-15s/""assault weapons,"" which hurts both corporations and individuals putting together parts in their homes to build their own firearms. 

Add that to his extreme anti-gun stance of [wanting to ban any gun ""used to kill people - not used for hunting.""](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTvD0DFYh9s)

"5278","1460768298","&gt; SANDERS: I grew up in Brooklyn, New York...

&gt; (APPLAUSE)

&gt; ... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.

&gt; I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just don’t accept that.

&gt; What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.

&gt; And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.

&gt; (APPLAUSE)

&gt; That is what the political revolution is about. That is what this campaign is about. And with your help, we’re going to win here in New York. Thank you. Thank you.

YES WE CAN."

She is running in the Democratic primary, not the general election. The only other campaign in the Democratic primary is that of Bernie Sanders, and he faces the same scrutiny that she does - he just doesn't have any transcripts to release!

So this talk of 'fairness' is a bullshit cop out. Terribly irresponsible, tremendously un-presidential. Now that Bernie is releasing his tax returns they have no argument to fall back on. "

The problem is that, even she would admit that the oil company pours TONS of money to different GOP candidates, and that is why the GOP denies climate change up and down.  The problem is that by her taking money she is participating in a broken/rigged system.  She is not standing up to it, even if it doesn't change her vote, it's changing many others votes and it's the reason this country is not moving forward.

That being said.  It totally changes her vote."

"5325","1460720687","Does anyone know why Sanders was being a bit evasive on this issue? They kept trying to pin him down as to why he couldn't just release them all at once and he deflected the questions with a non-answer?

Of course he's going to release them, he is obligated to file by law and should release them by precedent, it's simply a matter of time. On the other hand, speech transcripts are not legally obligated and can be kept private. Now if only Hillary Clinton and her supporters were as pro-active about those speech transcripts. Instead of going out of the way to spend all of that money and energy on noise generators, she should have already released them.

"5334","1460726059","Let's all assume Bernie is guilty of major tax fraud, or fucking up his taxes.


How does this change anything? The transcripts are to establish whether or not there is a conflict of interest. Why would people make this into a petty ""omg you go first"" argument? They can both be guilty, so why wouldn't you all expect to see both things? 

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

This isn't a fucking game, it's not about picking teams. You should be expecting whoever you support to release their respective things, to further your support, and prove that they deserve it. 
"
"5335","1460698361","I would say that I don't understand why this is such a big issue but I do understand why. Sanders hasn't released them, it's been weeks and he hasn't released these tax returns the same returns which Hillary has released. People make the claims that he couldn't be bothered to return home while on the campaign trail but Mitt Romney was also on the rigorous trail and Romney didn't get a pass for it. Neither should Sanders. He claims that his wife handles the taxes, and that is good and fine, but if that's true there is no reason why she can't fly to Vermont grab em' and fly back. The wait to get them has caused this mess and he could've easily put it to bed. "
"5336","1460722755","I don't really care or think there's anything interesting in them, but what was Sanders' justification for only releasing last year's and not the returns from any previous years?

Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said. Francis recently helped negotiate a historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations that has led to restored diplomatic ties between the countries."

The only question here is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs they impose.

&gt;There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.

"5560","1460913306","&gt; Sanders has drawn recent criticism from gun violence prevention advocates and fellow candidate Hilary Clinton over his 2005 vote for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a federal law that gave gun stores — and gun manufacturers — broad immunity from lawsuits. Meanwhile, his support of small gun manufacturers in the U.S. drew praise from the National Rifle Association in March.

FFS.

MSM has been incredibly disingenuous on this issue. Sanders is clearly against allowing military style weapons being sold to civilians as well as in favour of holding makers/sellers liable for manufacturer's defects and wrongful selling practices. He is entirely against immunity under these circumstances but they are taking the part where he stipulates that outside of these circumstances you should *not* be able to sue and presenting it as if he's still saying that you shouldn't be able to sue at all. Nothing regarding Sanders' stance on this issue ever changed.

[Source:](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-gun-policy/)

&gt; Manufacturer Liability: Gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the misuse of their products, just as any other industry isn’t held accountable for how end-consumers use their products.

&gt; Bernie believes that gun control is largely a state issue because attitudes and actions with regards to firearms differ greatly between rural and urban communities. Nevertheless, Bernie believes there are situations where the federal government should intervene. **He voted in favor of requiring background checks to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of felons and the mentally ill, passing a federal ban on assault weapons, and closing loopholes which allows private sellers at gun shows and on the internet to sell to individuals without background checks.**

&gt; To what extent does Bernie believe that gun regulation should be a federal issue?

&gt; Bernie has voted in favor of a nationwide ban on assault weapons, a nationwide ban on high-capacity magazines of over ten rounds, and nationwide expanded background checks that address unsafe loopholes.

With respect to the Sandy Hook lawsuit, [he supports it:] (http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/14/politics/transcript-democratic-debate-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/)

&gt; BLITZER: So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?

&gt; SANDERS: No, I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. **They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.**

He supports it based on this [premise] (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36050659)

&gt; The suit argues that the semi-automatic rifle used in the school shooting is a military weapon and should not have been sold to civilians.

"5631","1460817578","[Link](https://www.scribd.com/doc/308299698/Cavanaugh-v-Bartelt) to the case.  

In looking up this case, it appears that the plaintiff, Stephen W. Cavanaugh, brought this case as pro se plaintiff meaning he had no legal representation.  This case, in my opinion, was decided incorrectly and with adequate counsel should be reversed on appeal and allowed to progress.  The Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to 10(b)(6).

While I couldn't read the Complaint, it appears that Cavanaugh sued prison officials pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages because he was denied (1) access to wear religious clothing; (2) ability to congregate for weekly worship services and classes; and (3) right to receive communion.  The prison officials denied his requests because they concluded that ""FSMism was a parody religion.""

The Court goes through a lengthy historical detail regarding evolution and briefly discusses the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  While I do not have access to the motion to dismiss, I imagine the arguments made within are parroted in this decision in whole.  It ultimately holds that the religion is in fact a parody before analyzing the legal arguments.

Cavanaugh's claims: (1) Violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of religion of the US Constitution; (2) Article I, §4 of the Nebraska Constitution; (3) Equal Protection provisions of the US Constitution; and (4) Article I, §3 of the Nebraska Constitution.  The Court construed the Complaint as raising a claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) U.S.C. §2000cc.

The Court first analyzed RLUIPA which requires protection against government action when the government's conduct imposes (1) a substantial burden (2) on a religious exercise.  In analyzing the ""religious exercise,"" the Court held that RLUIPA may only be raised to protect sincere religious beliefs and not secular ways of life.  The Court essentially rules that FSMism is not a religion but a parody, and equates the religious  texts to that of Jonathan Swift's ""Modest Proposal"" which advocates cannibalism.  Ruling that FSMism is not a religion, it is not awarded protection under RLUIPA.

There is no cause of action for money damages under RLUIPA against state officials acting in their official capacities, so the claim is barred by sovereign immunity.  Thus the Court held that Cavanaugh failed to state a claim for relief, so his claim for injunctive relief was dismissed.

His First Amendment claim is dismissed because, as a pro se claimant, he failed to state an alleged injury-- i.e. argue that he was substantially burdened and required to alter his behavior. 

His Equal Protection claim is dismissed essentially because the Court ruled that the officials ""considered Cavanaugh's request in good faith and concluded, reasonably, that FSMism was satirical and required no accommodation.""

His state claims were dismissed because they offered the same protections as their federal counterparts.

The plaintiff was offered no leave to amend his Complaint, and the Order was final. 

EDIT: It is worth noting that the IRS has approved the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster tax exempt status 501(C)3.

I'll keep working for Bernie, though, because he has put the establishment on notice. No more taking young people and the Left for granted. Time to get back to real American values.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "
"5769","1460698052","because it's a minor protest that barely registers a blip in the history of DC protests?"
"5770","1460734706","I heard it on NPR yesterday.  Apparently this time is literally the worst time to protest. Congress is at the slowest pace it has been in a while,  I with so little attendance. Too many politicians are focused on their elections. "

In a world when all business was done face-to-face, everyone lived and worked in the street, people were generally more restrained in voicing opinions, and a large group of anybody was a legitimate threat - then ok. Nowadays - who cares. People used to take to the street because doing so made them loud and unavoidably in the way. If I have to do a Google search to even know a protest is happening it's pointless. "
"5780","1460681953","Maybe because everyone is sick and tired of endless election year protests manufactured to grab headlines in promotion of one progressive cause after another, and the reporters know it? Just a thought."

"5855","1460773896","A moral economy is one that functions on basic economic principles. A basic tenet is the law of diminishing returns meaning your second dollar should be harder to earn than your first and your third harder than your second. Right now, due to globalization, corruption, and a tax system that gives the wealthy bigger credits and deductions we have one that works ass backwards. The rich can't help but get richer and they hardly have to work for it."
"5856","1460777138","A moral economy is one which serves human needs and keeps the planet livable.  Capital accumulation as an end in itself has some fatal flaws.  It grows by ever-expanding debt, on the assumption of limitless growth, that will always be large enough to repay past debts, to keep the whole game credible.  But that's no longer working.  Instead, we get bubbles and busts.  Real wealth has stagnated.  What to do? Assume that global warming is real, and very threatening.  It does not present market signals that promote survival.  What's needed is a global-political re-orientation to direct resources for a sustainable future.  For that future to be worth living in, it must involve people in decision-making, and as much local control as possible.  That's where all this must go, or we can just give up the fight.  Bernie and Francis and betting that humans will fight to survive.  And that fight must be cooperative."

"5860","1460822408","All right. Since no one is willing to answer the question of how clearly to define it, I'll draw my own conclusion. ""Moral economy"" is a new word wrapping for the old economic system ""socialism."" Putting it in a shiny new clamshell pack of words difficult to pry open may be deceptive marketing, but its promoters hope it will be enough to get buyers to purchase their item again, something that due to the market's bad experience with the product they cannot do if they continue to package it as ""socialism.""

Francis invited Sanders to the stage and microphone of the Vatican immediately prior to a critically important primary because he too is selling the product, and indeed he is the leading marketer behind the new packaging design. The program is being taken up now by others involved in the sales effort.

I doubt it will work. Buyers are not so stupid they will be tricked by a shiny new package on a failed old product, not many of them, not for long. There being no consumer protection agency to regulate false political advertising, though, the marketing can go forward."

"5871","1460732181","I still think his answer is vague and unclear both in the NYT interview and during the debate.

This makes it sound like there is one simple metric out there that they can use when it is an enormously complicated issue.  It seems perfectly fair to criticize his answers as vague and lacking details because that is exactly what they are.

She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.  She doesn't need to go to jail.. they need to revoke her clearance and boot her ass out of any position of responsibility."

So, it looks like it included social media and blogs and other online media along with traditional cnn.com, abcnews.com and fox.com..

All you compassionate conservatives out there - I hope you say a little prayer for the manual labor that went into your 'immigrant labor subsidised' plate of food - every meal every day. High wage immigrant labor keeps social security solvent (until 2034 atleast). Their taxes is what keeps the boomer SS checks from bouncing. Not to mention the growth in GDP from tech growth.

In five out of the seven years, the median salaries were slightly lower for women without Clinton’s salary included. But when all the years were combined, the median salary was $40,000 for both groups. The average salary — again, taking out Clinton’s salary — was nearly identical, $50,398 for men and $49,336 for women.

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.

He has been linked to the killing of children in sandy hook, accused of not knowing how to implement his own plans, linked to communist dictators, accused of being a racist, a sexist and more, yet he still does better than HRC in election matchups and has a far higher favorability rating.

We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again.

"6509","1460711369","Today, for the first time since at least 5 or 6 months, I actually watched a democratic debate on TV. We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.  




(http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-really-hard-to-get-bernie-sanders-988-more-delegates/) 

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Conn Clinton +6

Maryland Clinton +22

Penn  Clinton +14

CA  Clinton +11

NJ  Clinton +25

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

"6611","1460744196","This column encapsulates Reddit, /r/politics, and /r/SandersforPresident in a nutshell:

&gt;What you see, on this as on multiple issues, is the casual adoption, with no visible effort to check the premises, of a story line that sounds good. It’s all about the big banks; single-payer is there for the taking if only we want it; government spending will yield huge payoffs — not the more modest payoffs conventional Keynesian analysis suggests; Republican support will vanish if we take on corporate media.

&gt;In each case the story runs into big trouble if you do a bit of homework; if not completely wrong, it needs a lot of qualification. But the all-purpose response to anyone who raises questions is that she or he is a member of the establishment, personally corrupt, etc.. Ad hominem attacks aren’t a final line of defense, they’re argument #1.

&gt;I know some people think that I’m obsessing over trivial policy details, but they’re missing the point. *It’s about an attitude, the sense that righteousness excuses you from the need for hard thinking and that any questioning of the righteous is treason to the cause.* **When you see Sanders supporters going over the top about “corporate whores” and such, you’re not seeing a mysterious intrusion of bad behavior into an idealistic movement; you’re seeing the intolerance that was always just under the surface of the movement, right from the start.**

I started out as neutral. I'm not American and I like to watch American politics from afar because I don't have to get emotionally invested and I don't have to eventually pick a side. But then the Sanders supporters got just so very toxic.

**Sanders supporters, you need to pay attention to this:** Your movement is toxic. You've taken it and tarnished it and smeared shit all over it. You've treated everyone who wasn't a True Believer in Bernie Sanders like a pariah, or like they're an evil paid corporate shill. You've acted like condescending assholes that nobody wants to associate with.

You will look back on this one day and you will cringe with embarrassment. You will get involved more deeply in politics one day and you will realize that your actions helped strangle Bernie Sanders's presidential bid in its cradle. You will look back at this and realize that you acted completely contrary to how people need to act in politics to win supporters.

It's sad this article is getting downvoted, because you need to read it. You guys need to know one of the reasons Bernie is losing and why he will never win."

"6639","1460838699","That's a whole lot of words to oversimplify our legal system. First of all, for major crimes the prosecutor isn't the one who makes the determination, it's a grand jury that examines the evidence and makes the determination if there should be a trial or not.
For lesser crimes, like you said, the prosecutor looks at the evidence and makes a determination. If there is enough evidence, whether it's physical, eye witnesses, or even if it's circumstantial, that there is a reasonable chance that they might have committed the crime, then they proceed. You're right in that it's not the prosecutor's job to determine guilt or innocence. It's their job to determine whether or not the possibility of guilt exists, and from there to build a case and prove it. What's the alternative? If we only prosecuted people that are 100% bulletproof guilty, we'd end up with a lot of unsolved crimes.

As for your contention that prosecutors are all some kind of robot concerned only with putting the maximum number of people in jail? Don't be a shithead. I mean, yeah, there are assholes in every line of work, and some prosecutors are more interested in making themselves look good by closing out high profile crimes. There are prosecutors who are racists, and will do everything they can to put minorities in jail.

"6640","1460840450","&gt;They don't believe it's their job to only prosecute guilty people.

Almost every crime has two components. Actus rea, a guilty act, and mens rea, the guilty mind. There are no ""objectively"" guilty people to prosecute. Prosecutors can't read minds. If prosecutors only wanted to prosecute ""the guilty,"" no one would ever be prosecuted.

&gt;[They think] that their job is to accuse everyone they think they can convince a jury is guilty.

That is their job. Again, there are no 'objectively guilty' people running around out there. 

&gt;Imagine, if you will, a case where two criminals - both total scum with long rap sheets - are arrested for something, and each implicates the other as the main criminal actor and themselves as a helpless bystander to their counterpart's actions. The available physical evidence can be played either way. But one of them is white and the other is black, and the jury hearing the case will definitely be white. Guess what a prosecutor is going to do with that situation?

There are a lot of reasons why juries are mostly white, but the alternative to a jury system (usually empowering the judge) is no better at removing systemic abuse.

&gt;An honest, remotely moral person would admit that they don't have enough evidence to confidently state who is the leader, 

That's not the prosecutor's call to make. Again, it's not up to the prosecutor to determine who had the mens rea and/or committed the actus rea. That's up to the jury. It would not be fair for a prosecutor to unilaterally find someone guilty; finding someone innocent without a jury trial is no less unfair. If you can make a prima facie case, let the jury decide.

&gt;They disfigure the concept of justice they are required to advocate, seeing their imposed position as ""someone must pay"" rather than ""those responsible must pay.""

The problem of ""those responsible must pay"" is that someone must decide who is responsible. You seem to have omniscience over who is ""guilty"" and who is ""innocent."" Why have a jury trial at all? We could simply ask you what to do! A great improvement.

&gt;Knowing the people who elected them to be stupid, ignorant, and irresponsible,

Do you have a smarter, more responsible system? Let's hear it. Mostly it sounds to me like, ""prosecutors need to be convinced that someone is guilty and then a jury will hear the case. If the jury gets it 'wrong', we ignore the jury."" 

All in all, this is the problem with believing that guilt and innocence are concepts that exist divorced from the practice of law. OJ isn't a guilty man running free, he's innocent. 

That doesn't mean he didn't commit the actus reus, but it means that there is reasonable doubt that he committed the actus reus while holding the mens rea necessary for the crime. 

Of course, if you have the ability to be both omniscient and a mind-reader, the criminal justice system would seem superfluous.

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.

As President, I would do nothing to help you feel safer and more secure regarding sexual violence, harassment, and rape.  What the fuck am I, as President of the United States, going to do?

OK.  Fine.  Is it also immoral and wrong to advise people to lock their car doors when they leave?  Or how about to lock their front door when they go to bed at night?

She found out because after we moved counties, we both registered online in our new county (Riverside) for mail in ballots and didnt receive our mail-in ballots during the vote a couple months ago, thus we didn't vote. so she phoned to find out what happened...

All planned to vote for Sanders. It shouldn't matter much as Hillary won by a blowout in this state, but it still happened. 

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana. If I called breathlessly to a local election official with how several people I know plus dozens upon dozens of people on Internet were disenfranchised, it would all be shrugged off.

I pretended not to be registered and looked over the form and sure enough ""Republican"" was checked off on all of the forms in their possession. I told them then that I was already registered as an independent, that party affiliation was NOT required to vote and that these people were obviously lying, and I said it loudly enough that everyone around could hear me.

"6871","1460653839","Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman have written an [article](http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/36110-focus-is-the-2016-election-already-being-stripped-a-flipped) on the subject entitled, ""Is the 2016 Election Already Being Stripped &amp; Flipped?"", which is worth the read.

However, in addition to voter registration issues, there also appears to be something irregular happening with the vote counts themselves. There's this comment posted to [this](http://theantimedia.org/2016-americans-realized-elections-rigged/) article from Antimedia entitled, ""2016: The Year the Americans Found out Our Elections Are Rigged"";

&gt; Bruce Wm Sargent · Yale University
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence from data, numbers drawn from unadjusted exit polls and vote shares in the 2016 Democratic Primaries, give us clear evidence of massive election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues."
"6872","1460657018","Ok here's the thing. I believe this happened to me as well n the AZ primary. I'm not sure how to get the hard copy of the change but I may look into it. Anyways in order for this to be a conspiracy the change would have to benefit someone. I just don't see how anyone could benefit with certainty. Sure you could say Hillary benefited from me not being able to vote. But no one would have any idea if I was going to vote for Hillary of Bernie. It would be a crap shoot as to which vote got nullified. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have to error more on the side that this more of a database type problem. I saw tons of people in line with me that experienced that same issue. Seeing forged names looks suspicious but how could you possibly determine who could benefit from an affiliation change. Hell I'm not even in the under 40 group."

FYI she filled out the change registration forms at my request ""just to be sure"" even though she was sure she didn't need to. Luckily for her, you can change from independent to Dem in NJ on the day of the primaries"
"6880","1460666236","Well if we can't have a fair and accurate primary, then we should just start focusing on the general election now.

Here in Sweden, you get a unique voter form mailed to you, but it's possible to vote even without them. It's just easier with them. Then you go to your designated polling office, vote locally, regionally and nationally by choosing the party you want to vote for (we have a bunch) and showing a valid photo ID, like a drivers license or a passport. Then every vote is recounted and the voting records with matching IDs are checked. There's no voter fraud and there's no need to register beforehand. Oh yeah, and we don't deny people the right to vote just because they've had trouble with the law before.

Local, regional and national parliaments are then divided based on the corresponding voter percentages. No first past the post shit. No gerrymandering shit. No electoral college shit. It's basic and it works because it's damn hard to corrupt it. 

The US voting system is a laughing stock."

The amounts of jobs to produce value (goods and services) will drop drastically in the near future, but not the means of production.

Someone needs to consume that value. Just another reason why income inequality is a serious issue to the economy. If we have loads of poor people not being able to buy anything, what are we gonna do? Just pile laptops and teslas in some warehouse somewhere for no reason at all?

And yes, there will obviously be jobs, and entirely new industries, but most likely people will spend a lot more time studying, researching, coding and creating art when a lot of mindless jobs have been taken over by robots.

"7062","1460761763","Frankly, as an atheist liberal and someone who generally despises Cruz [edit: it's a Kasich quote. Same applies], this still makes a lot of sense to me. A woman and a man both getting hammered increases the odds of something going awry. 

It isn't victim-blaming any more than it is perpetrator-excusing. It's simple, research-supported truth: alcohol increase the chances of someone committing or being a victim of rape. 

Edit: before the downvoting and irrational rage start pouring in, consider:

""Rape is more common on college campuses with higher rates of binge drinking – and alcohol use is a central factor in most college rapes...""

Source: http://archive.sph.harvard.edu/cas/Documents/rapeintox-pressRelease/


""On average, at least 50% of college students’ sexual assaults are associated with alcohol use (Abbey et al., 1996a, 1998; Copenhaver and Grauerholz, 1991; Harrington and Leitenberg, 1994; Presley et al., 1997). Koss (1988) re- ported that 74% of the perpetrators and 55% of the victims of rape in her nationally representative sample of college students had been drinking alcohol.""

Trump should be able to get 51% of delegates if he wants the nomination locked down.

That being said, Colorado was 100% Putin-style rigged, and there are quite a few other shady things happening at the state convention level within both parties.

&gt; As a candidate, Trump's complaints are laughable. If Trump is so disorganized as a candidate that he can't even assemble the team to master the delegate and convention rules, how is he going to manage to run the massive federal bureaucracy, not to mention to defeat ISIS or build a multibillion dollar wall between the United States and Mexico?

I also find this point absolutely infuriating.  This is a democracy, and unfortunately, in a first-past-the-post democracy, 2-party dominance is mandatory.  But if these are the two parties that we are forced to have, they need to stop behaving in anti-democratic ways and relying on the tired excuse of ""Well it's just a private club choosing their nominee!""  

No.  Just no.  You don't get to be a private club in a First-Past-The-Post democracy.  Give me proportional representation and ranked choices, and *then* you can pretend you're not effectively a mandatory pillar of government that might as well have been written into the constitution by default.

Another contrast I noticed was Hillary's refusal to implement a carbon tax to speed the transition away from fossil fuels.  Finally, Hillary's refusal to embrace a single payer healthcare was made a bit more subtle.  She used the words ""universal healthcare"" which means we may not getting any real cost savings like Canada and Europe gets.  ""Universal healthcare"" still allows local private insurance monopolies to exist, so long as everyone is covered, even if the premiums bankrupt people. Only ""single payer healthcare"" is proven to be 300% more efficient per capita."

And who is left to pick up the pieces? The poor, the middle-class, us.

The problem is Bernie doesn't want to fully hang the albatross around Hillary's neck, perhaps in deference to the fact that she is likely to be the nominee and will need progressives' support in the general. 

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

Everyone in the establishment is warning that Bernie had better be careful and not do anything to permanently damage Hillary. But you KNOW if Bernie were leading Hillary would do everything she could to permanently damage Bernie without hesitation, because all she cares about is winning, despite her claims to the contrary. And nobody in the establishment would come to Bernie's defense and say ""hey back off don't destroy our potential nominee."" And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

Americans have called ""shenanigans"" on this in both parties, this election.

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.  

Both conventions this year will be hotly contested.  We'll see delegates switching, terrible accusations being made, etc. But what we'll mainly see is a question of ""Who is the Party?  Is it the people who register and vote for that Party?  Or is it the few wealthy elites behind the scenes that are the Party?""

"7320","1460652034","I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

I have the utmost respect for Sanders trying to be the 'moral candidate', his desire to shun religion from the presidency, his passion for empowering the middle and lower classes. But I cannot believe how quickly logic and basic economics has gone out the window with his supporters. We're supposed to be the party of knowledge, not rhetoric."

&gt;For years, the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in Citizens United was depicted by Democrats as the root of all political evil. But now, the core argument embraced by the Court’s conservatives to justify their ruling has taken center stage in the Democratic primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders – because Clinton supporters, to defend the huge amount of corporate cash on which their candidate is relying, frequently invoke that very same reasoning."

I think this highlights the difference between good law and good policy or morality.  Even when something is legal, it can still be morally wrong.  Just because Clinton legally can solicit donations from Big Finance doesn't mean it reflects well on her as a principled politician.

She's not doing anything illegal but we should still critique her for doing something that is both legal and wrong that compromises her as a champion of the people and shows her to be a sell out to the interests of the rich."

TLDR; The Colorado election process is a complex game best played by people who understand the rules.  Trump didn't figure them out but Cruz did.

"7588","1460854547","&gt;1) Trump did not attack all Mexicans;....

I don't think anyone is arguing that he did. I think the bigger issue is that using rhetoric to point out that illegal immigrants have rapists among them (when lets face it, so does every group) implies, and is interpreted, as a criticism of immigration.  He may not have directly stated as much, but it would be stupid to assume that it wouldn't be interpreted as such. 

&gt;2) ... He's a new politician (...) so he shouldn't be criticized more than pro-life Republicans

He absolutely should be criticized more. He is running for president, and is very vocal and, frankly, arrogant in the way he presents his views, which directly correlates to being offensive for the sake of being offensive. 

&gt;4) (Trump flopped on his views to stay on party lines) 

He had a better view, then changed it to one that is less progressive. Of course some people see this as worse, making a bad decision. He deserves any criticism for both backing down on what he stands for (which is his platform ffs) and for moving away from progress

&gt;6) Trump won his votes fair and square. 

I actually haven't seen anyone arguing to the contrary, not sure why you brought it up. It's actually sort of a big part of the problem, though not a problem with him in particular but an issue that speaks about politics in general. 

&gt;8) Trump is more reasonable off camera (doesn't drink alcohol, is more well mannered, etc) 

I think it's right to be concerned about a candidate that is this two faced. Again, not Trump's fault per say, but speaks a lot of a bigger problem (The media circus, the roll money plays in elections, etc) I'm really not sure what drinking has to do with anything, other than I am marginally surprised it doesn't turn republican voters away from him. 



Mostly, and I think it echoes in this sub since it tends to be younger and more liberal, Trump is the embodiment of a lot of things that are wrong with the current political system. He's famous because he's rich, he's supported because he's loud and rich, and even people writing in defense of his policies (like yourself) have to load the article with caveats and are reaching so far that they are forced to make lame comparisons with other candidates (which presents it's own problems since the reason a lot of people like Trump is because he *isn't* like other candidates.) 

He is quintessentially everything this sub is against, being mostly anti progress, money driven, and thriving on the media circus. It's less about his policies or who he is, and more about what he is as an idea. "
"7589","1460854897","&gt;Here are some of the issues I've had with a small fraction of the things he's said. I would be interested in hearing your views on them.

[...] I am saying I want to see the birth certificate. It’s very simple. I want to see the birth certificate. How come his own family doesn’t know which hospital he was born in? How come– forget about birth certificates. Let’s say there’s no birth certificate. How come in the hospital itself, okay? This is one of the…in the hospital itself, there’s no records of his birth. In other words, it doesn’t say how much they paid, where is the doctor, here’s your room bill. You know, all the [...] Well, I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they’re talking. Absolutely. And they cannot believe what they’re finding. And I’m serious

&gt;On unemployment:
""The number isn't reflective,"" he said. ""I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent."" He continued, ""5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent.""

&gt;On Foreign policy.
""He said I was in favor in Libya,"" Trump said, sounding perplexed. ""I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gaddafi would be in charge right now.""
""I can’t believe what our country is doing,"" Trump said, according to a BuzzFeed transcript. ""Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage."" [...] ""But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals,"" Trump said. ""It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.""

&gt;On History:
""They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,"" Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. ""And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem.""

&gt;On what he remembers:
""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,"" the Republican presidential candidate said at a Nov. 21 rally in Birmingham, Ala. ""And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.""

&gt;He then claimed
""I have the world's greatest memory.""
He then posted a story from a crippled reporter who he had previously met that actually proved his allegations wrong. When the reporter pointed that out, Trump made fun of him and again claimed to have forgotten who he was.

&gt;On what he's said:
Quick: ""You have talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him (Facebook founder) Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator, because he was in favor of the H-1B visa.""
Trump: ""I never said that. I never said that.""
He did.

&gt;On Bernie Sanders:
""This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton’s) right is giving everything away, so she’s following,"" Trump said on Oct. 14, referring to the Democratic debate the night before. ""He’s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He’s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I’d call him a socialist/communist, okay? ‘Cause that's what he is.""

&gt;On what he hears:
""I don't think the 11 million -- which is a number you have been hearing for many many years, I've been hearing that number for five years -- I don't think that is an accurate number anymore,"" Trump said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 24. ""I am now hearing it's 30 million, it could be 34 million, which is a much bigger problem.""

&gt;On basic finance:
""He raises a million dollars and it costs between $25 million and $50 million, and they close up the entire city of New York,"" Trump said Oct. 13 on Fox News’ Fox and Friends.

&gt;On his poll numbers:
""CNN did a poll recently where President Obama and I are statistically tied,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday morning upon arriving in New Hampshire. ""If you would like, I can send it to you. Call up CNN."" CNN didn't conduct such a survey.

&gt;On the internet:
""We're losing a lot of people because of the internet,"" Trump said. ""We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways. Somebody will say, 'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.""

&gt;On war crimes:
""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said.

&gt;On vaccines:
“I’ve seen it,” he claimed, “a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine… a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.” [...] ""You take this little beautiful baby, and you pump — I mean, it looks like just it's meant for a horse and not for a child,"" Trump said. ""We had so many instances [in which] a child had a vaccine, and came back and a week back had a tremendous fever, got very very sick, and now is autistic.""

"7597","1460860219","&gt; Trump initially said that he wanted to be neutral between Palestine and Israel. He completely changed his views to mainstream Republican orthodoxy leading up to and including his AIPAC speech. But, his initial common sense views are getting rave reviews when Bernie spoke them at Thursday's debate. Therefore, Trump deserves some credit for seeing the issue clearly.

I'd argue if he moved from the right position to the wrong one that it's completely the opposite of seeing things clearly. I know what you were trying to say, that he was somehow forced to do that to appease republicans even though he's been winning the nom so far since the very first votes and didn't need to appease AIPAC at that point. Bernie on the other hand stuck with his principles on it and has continued to do so even if it might alienate a sector of voters that disagree with him.

I think the bigger issue is that using rhetoric to point out that illegal immigrants have rapists among them (when lets face it, so does every group) implies, and is interpreted, as a criticism of immigration.  He may not have directly stated as much, but it would be stupid to assume that it wouldn't be interpreted as such. 

&gt;2) ... He's a new politician (...) so he shouldn't be criticized more than pro-life Republicans

He absolutely should be criticized more. He is running for president, and is very vocal and, frankly, arrogant in the way he presents his views, which directly correlates to being offensive for the sake of being offensive. 

&gt;4) (Trump flopped on his views to stay on party lines) 

He had a better view, then changed it to one that is less progressive. Of course some people see this as worse, making a bad decision. He deserves any criticism for both backing down on what he stands for (which is his platform ffs) and for moving away from progress

&gt;6) Trump won his votes fair and square. 

I actually haven't seen anyone arguing to the contrary, not sure why you brought it up. It's actually sort of a big part of the problem, though not a problem with him in particular but an issue that speaks about politics in general. 

&gt;8) Trump is more reasonable off camera (doesn't drink alcohol, is more well mannered, etc) 

I think it's right to be concerned about a candidate that is this two faced. Again, not Trump's fault per say, but speaks a lot of a bigger problem (The media circus, the roll money plays in elections, etc) I'm really not sure what drinking has to do with anything, other than I am marginally surprised it doesn't turn republican voters away from him. 



Mostly, and I think it echoes in this sub since it tends to be younger and more liberal, Trump is the embodiment of a lot of things that are wrong with the current political system. He's famous because he's rich, he's supported because he's loud and rich, and even people writing in defense of his policies (like yourself) have to load the article with caveats and are reaching so far that they are forced to make lame comparisons with other candidates (which presents it's own problems since the reason a lot of people like Trump is because he *isn't* like other candidates.) 

He is quintessentially everything this sub is against, being mostly anti progress, money driven, and thriving on the media circus. It's less about his policies or who he is, and more about what he is as an idea. "

&gt;On Obama's birth certificate:
It says you have to be born in this country. Essential. Have to be born in this country, okay? If he wasn’t born in this country, he has conned the whole world. [...] I am saying I want to see the birth certificate. It’s very simple. I want to see the birth certificate. How come his own family doesn’t know which hospital he was born in? How come– forget about birth certificates. Let’s say there’s no birth certificate. How come in the hospital itself, okay? This is one of the…in the hospital itself, there’s no records of his birth. In other words, it doesn’t say how much they paid, where is the doctor, here’s your room bill. You know, all the [...] Well, I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they’re talking. Absolutely. And they cannot believe what they’re finding. And I’m serious

&gt;On unemployment:
""The number isn't reflective,"" he said. ""I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent."" He continued, ""5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent.""

&gt;On Foreign policy.
""He said I was in favor in Libya,"" Trump said, sounding perplexed. ""I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gaddafi would be in charge right now.""
""I can’t believe what our country is doing,"" Trump said, according to a BuzzFeed transcript. ""Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage."" [...] ""But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals,"" Trump said. ""It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.""

&gt;On History:
""They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,"" Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. ""And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem.""

&gt;On what he remembers:
""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,"" the Republican presidential candidate said at a Nov. 21 rally in Birmingham, Ala. ""And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.""

&gt;He then claimed
""I have the world's greatest memory.""
He then posted a story from a crippled reporter who he had previously met that actually proved his allegations wrong. When the reporter pointed that out, Trump made fun of him and again claimed to have forgotten who he was.

&gt;On what he's said:
Quick: ""You have talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him (Facebook founder) Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator, because he was in favor of the H-1B visa.""
Trump: ""I never said that. I never said that.""
He did.

&gt;On Bernie Sanders:
""This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton’s) right is giving everything away, so she’s following,"" Trump said on Oct. 14, referring to the Democratic debate the night before. ""He’s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He’s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I’d call him a socialist/communist, okay? ‘Cause that's what he is.""

&gt;On what he hears:
""I don't think the 11 million -- which is a number you have been hearing for many many years, I've been hearing that number for five years -- I don't think that is an accurate number anymore,"" Trump said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 24. ""I am now hearing it's 30 million, it could be 34 million, which is a much bigger problem.""

&gt;On basic finance:
""He raises a million dollars and it costs between $25 million and $50 million, and they close up the entire city of New York,"" Trump said Oct. 13 on Fox News’ Fox and Friends.

&gt;On his poll numbers:
""CNN did a poll recently where President Obama and I are statistically tied,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday morning upon arriving in New Hampshire. ""If you would like, I can send it to you. Call up CNN."" CNN didn't conduct such a survey.

&gt;On the internet:
""We're losing a lot of people because of the internet,"" Trump said. ""We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways. Somebody will say, 'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.""

&gt;On war crimes:
""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said.

&gt;On vaccines:
“I’ve seen it,” he claimed, “a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine… a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.” [...] ""You take this little beautiful baby, and you pump — I mean, it looks like just it's meant for a horse and not for a child,"" Trump said. ""We had so many instances [in which] a child had a vaccine, and came back and a week back had a tremendous fever, got very very sick, and now is autistic.""

I'd argue if he moved from the right position to the wrong one that it's completely the opposite of seeing things clearly.

The math already does not work, and the math will basically be pretty damn solid after the 19th if he doesn't come away with a considerable delegate pull.

I'm of the same mindset as robert reich who said she's a good candidate for the system we have now but bernie is the candidate for the government we need. Anyone who says she is no different from the GOP is foolish. She may be a typical politician but overall her policies will be very different from trump/cruz and even kasich."

Superdelegates have never decided a Democratic Party nominating contest. They will not decide this Democratic Party nominating contest. Stop publishing 19 columns about superdelegates a day. Your only goal seems to be ginning up division and phantom injustices in the Democratic Party in order to get clicks. This kind of journalism serves no one.

"7735","1460630066","My takeaway from the primaries -

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

One thing I do like about the primaries is that in most cases it is not winner take all. I would actually like to see the general election adopt a similar rule where state's electoral votes are awarded proportionally to the popular vote of that state."

"7853","1460651938","Krugman is correct, though. See the FCIC testimonies of [Gary Gorton](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15787) and [Ben Bernanke](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm) as a starting point. Then read up on any serious research done by [central banks](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr506.pdf), government agencies (like [the OFR](https://financialresearch.gov/briefs/files/OFRbr-2015-03-repo-sec-lending.pdf)) and finance academics.

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

"7860","1460646328","&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

To read it as religious doctrine would be little different from grounding a ""religious exercise"" on any other work of fiction."" 

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

&gt; The saga continues.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

Voters have the right to say that they won't vote for her if she chooses not to be transparent on this issue. 

Other candidates are unambiguous on their stances towards big finance (with the exception of Mr. Trump, who is ambiguous on most policy topics). Her only opponent for the Democratic Nomination is a public servant who can't give those kinds of speeches for money by law, as are two of her three potential Republican rivals. So that leaves Mr. Trump, whose behavior is apparently now going to be the standard for transparency and disclosure in the Democratic Party? 

Senator Gillibrand says that she is certain that Clinton will release these transcripts eventually, when the time is somehow right for it. Apparently that is not going to be before people vote if the Clinton Campaign has their way, and they will move the goalposts as many times as they have to in order to delay. How is Clinton in a stronger position to demand further disclosures from anybody by insisting that she should not have to release transcripts that everyone knows that she had specially made as part of her standard speaking contract? What are they being saved for, some shelf in her future Presidential Library?

Nothing in Senator Sanders' tax returns is going to tell us more about the truth of his stated intention to regulate large financial institutions that present a systemic risk to the US and global economies. His actual statements and votes on the subject are a matter of public record and show remarkable consistency for over 25 years of elected service. The very fact that Secretary Clinton would rather not show these transcripts to the voting public, instead of being proud of their contents, speaks volumes as to how their contents would be viewed by the Democratic Primary electorate if not the general electorate as a whole."

It is not a double standard, she simply has done something that no other candidate has done.  If any other candidate did the same thing, I would want to see their transcripts too.  That makes it a single standard.  It's her fault for having made these speeches in the first place."

You realize his 'disavow' for David Duke was days after the fact, it's the equivalent of Clinton checking her polls before making a statement or opinion. I hope you also realize the definition of 'disavow' is to not accept responsibility for, when Reagan had to deal with the KKK he said flat out he doesn't want or need their support. 'Disavow' is a bs political term to make it sound like you disapprove of something without taking a firm stance. 

This is why they are protesting, because no one looks at the full picture of what Trump says/does, This is just their argument. I don't know why they curse, I went to an anti-Trump rally and there wasn't excessive expletives but it's a protest, everyone curses. "

"8415","1460823505","&gt;American Apparel, the biggest clothing maker in Los Angeles, said it **might** outsource the making of some garments to another manufacturer in the U.S

**Just scare tactics here. The company is simply trying to strong-arm the local government.**   

The current minimum wage is $10.00  and it will slowly rise to $15 over the next 6 years.   If American Apparel was really worried about labor cost they could have built their garment factory in say Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina or Tennessee all of which do not have a state minimum wage and thus starting pay is $7.25 an hour.  For some reason however they find LA a desirable location for their factory so I call bullshit.    Also by the time we get to 2022 the federal minimum wage will likely be close to $15 an hour anyway making the relocation argument a waste of time. "
"8416","1460823906","This is where I call bullshit that the minimum wage hike is the reason companies like American Apparel are cutting jobs or claiming they can't afford to stay.

1)""I used to pay $5 to get this sewn, and now it costs $6.50,"" Seo said, holding up a patterned dress. ""But my customer doesn't want to pay that, so I can't sell it anymore.""

People have no problem paying $1.50 more. Especially when their wages just went from 8 dollars an hour to gradually increasing to 15 an hour. The problem is companies like this see an opportunity to ship it overseas and pay $2 to get it sewn and can keep their prices the same. Maximizing their profit margin.(this is a problem with trade deals) And then blame the minimum wage for them leaving.

&gt;""it can be difficult to find skilled workers who can afford to live in the city.""

And then this bit. It is difficult because these skilled workers aren't going to work at a wage that doesn't cover living expenses. This problem is created by companies like American Apparel who refuse to pay their employees a wage that is reasonable.

Also, what they don't tell you is American Apparel has spent millions on lawsuits. They are poorly managed and have had plenty of issues and have made shitty decisions when it has came to the business. Now they have a scape goat. So they blame cutting jobs on other factors instead they just have completely sucked at managing the business. But it looks better blaming others.

&gt;Shadow banking is...

&gt;&gt;    a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co frame the issue as the big banks becoming involved in non-traditional banking including shadow-banking. Krugman says the problem is the shadow-banking itself no matter who is involved. Krugman is saying that the big 5 could still be involved in non-traditional banking (thus eliminating the need for glass-steagall) as long as shadow-banking was heavily regulated.

&gt;Bernie, Warren, &amp; co would want those regulations I'm sure, but also to separate traditional and non-traditional banking, a failsafe in case shadow-banking regulations fail.

This doesn't exist for various reasons. Journalists are people too and they have their own prejudices. Even when reporting facts, they can change the way their reporting will be perceived either by omission or commission (associating something to something else which may not necessarily relevant). So, the media is effectively divided into two kinds: those who lie blatantly, and those who do it with a lot of sophistication.

Otherwise, you could go with what Crichton referred to as [the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect](http://web.archive.org/web/20080312214444/http://www.michaelcrichton.com/speech-whyspeculate.html):

&gt; Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I call it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)

&gt; Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

&gt; In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

Sanders went on the offensive the whole debate and it simply doesn't look good on him. Sanders on the attack makes him look too angry, it makes him stumble over words, and he makes mistakes (in one instance he claimed Clinton hadn't answered the question and ironically it was one of the few questions she answered up front, though she rambled for the rest of her time to burn the clock).

I don't think this debate is going to change polls much (if at all) because while this was probably Clinton's worst debate performance of the campaign so far, it was also, arguably, Sanders's worst.

"8733","1460660206","But he doesn't ""slam"" Hillary Clinton who also joined the striking workers?

"8736","1460660296","Lowell McAdam seems so totally clueless - which I guess is typical of his ilk. To most people supporting Sanders the CEO's ""comeback"" will simply serve to prove their point about corporate greed. He should have just kept his mouth shut."

&gt; But what if Donald Trump, the master negotiator, the brilliant media tactician, the unparalleled manipulator of public opinion, DID know all about the rules? What if he didn’t bother going after those delegates because he knew it would benefit him more profoundly if he didn’t – turning what was perceived by his supporters and the general public unfamiliar with the arcane rules of the GOP into a national cause célèbre that would help his campaign steamroll over the competition in upcoming primaries in New York, Maryland, California and elsewhere?

Right.  Trump's idiocy is really genius.  Where have we heard this before?  Losing votes will only help him!"

Live by the tweet, die by the tweet."
"8745","1460744337","&gt; I made the mistake of expressing my opinion.

No, you and every Republican made the mistake of demonizing half of America using the very same rhetoric that you're now whining about having to endure.  I cannot muster an ounce of pity for any Republican who complains about Trump and his supporters' tone, yet does not acknowledge the role they played in creating this monster."

"8748","1460771287","I know. Crazy right? he thought he lived in a country where the voters decide things. I can see how he got confused. "
