"11","1461219055","**John Adams** - damn, that's one of the presidents who I think has one of the most complicated legacies.  To sum up my main views of his presidency, he was instrumental in keeping us out of war with France, despite most of the country absolutely screaming for it, and war with France that early in our nation's history would have only led to bad things.  That being said, his Alien and Sedition Acts are possibly the most unconstitutional and straight-up horrifying piece of legislature that has ever been passed in the United States. No way to view that as anything but abhorrent.

Overall, I view Adams as a great man and a wonderful influence on our country - but a pretty bad President.

**George Washington**, of course, is hard to separate from his Revolutionary War generalship, but we try to when it comes to the presidency.  Overall, I still think Washington was a better general than President, and was more a great leader of men than he was a leader of government.  But after the Articles of Confederation were scrapped and the new constitution took place, a leader of men is exactly what we needed, and Washington fit the bill perfectly.  No one could have better served as the first president, as the unifying president, than Washington.  But he also was tough and forceful when he needed to be.  I view his crushing of The Whiskey Rebellion as one of the greatest (and certainly one of the most important) executive acts by a President in history.  In a time when the Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist feud was still strong and it was still unclear (or some wanted it to be unclear) whether we were one country or thirteen countries in a loose confederation, Washington settled that debate and made it really fucking clear that the federal government was a strong government, one that could tax, pass laws, and enforce its will.  The whiskey rebellion is so little known, but it really was a pivotal point in the history of the United States, and a weaker response to it could have led to a weakened and fractured country or to the complete breaking up of the United States into different countries.  Washington dealt with it perfectly, crushing it and leaving no doubt as to the power and intent of the government and the new constitution while doing it with enough restraint that a grand total of *seven* died in this rebellion.

Also, his ""abdication"" (not a technical abdication, but he could have won as many terms as president as he wanted so long as he stayed alive) is one of the most important moves he ever did.  It set a precedent that all but one president obeyed until it became law, and is one of the greatest examples since Cincinnatus (all the way back in the fucking Roman Republic) of a great man and great leader taking power, wielding it as needed to make sure that stability, safety, and success were brought to the people they were ruling, and then voluntarily laying it down.  The importance of his decision not to run for a third term is hard to overstate.

While I think his reputation is a little overblown, Washington was still one of the great men of history, was what our country needed at its founding, and definitely makes my top five presidents list.


EDIT:  Also, just to add on to my response - this is a wonderful series, and I can't wait to see this develop over the coming months.

"16","1461202322","Washington to me is fascinating. There's a great scene in one of his biographies about the contrast of his morals and his failings as a man--this is of course, what makes a president fascinating in my mind. 

Washington was a slave-owner, but he hates the institution. In the book I am referring to, *Washington: A life*, Chernow points out that even though he hated it, he still utilized slavery. He talks about Washington venturing onto his plantation on horseback in the dead of winter, forcing pregnant women to pull up the trunks of trees in a swamp he wanted to convert to farmland. he couldn't understand why they didn't work harder when he gave them food and a place to live. The ground was frozen, and the women were most likely malnourished. 

It's really fascinating considering the man. It's also fascinating given the 20 dollar bill change today. Jackson, for his time, was an important president, whatever you think of the man. How do we separate these men from their morality, locked as it is in their own time? 

As a historian, that question fascinates me to no end. What should I think of Washington? He truly was a great president, I have no doubt about that. But he owned slaves. It's truly a tough question. How do you view him freeing his slaves when he died? Was he a coward because he didn't do it while he was alive? Or a hero because unlike most other slaveowners, he actually freed his slaves. late perhaps, but he did it.

But circumstances were not normal for us because we had a man as President who was INCREDIBLY respected.  Everyone back then - and the politics were VERY fractious - knew that Washington would always listen, think deeply and decide fairly.  Everyone - even the biggest pair of political enemies in this country's history, Jefferson and Hamilton - agreed to be led by this man who may be the MOST respected man in western history.

I am always amazed at the richness of our language as used by speakers more than two centuries ago in comparison to the far more limited strain that perpetuates in this century.  Yet this is merely an aside to the intention of my reply. 

There are many striking parallels in his address to the current atmosphere of our nation, several of which I could highlight here for discussion, but I will settle on one passage to bring to the fore, and that which pertains with special relevance to our present political environment; to wit:

&gt; 17  All obstructions to the execution of the Laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels, and modified by mutual interests.

Also; Madison convinced GW to be the president of the constitutional convention because he was the only person respected enough to persuade everyone to come together and work on much needed reforms.

"42","1461248047","The nation's third presidential residence was in Philadelphia. Washington lived there from November 27, 1790 to March 10, 1797. 

At the time, Pennsylvania had begun the process of abolition with a law that forbade state residents from being slave-holders. However, slaveholders from other states could keep their slaves in Pennsylvania for up to six months at a time (after which, they would become Freemen in the eyes of the state).

Washington took advantage of a loophole in the law by rotating his slaves between his estate in Virginia and his residence in Philadelphia every six months; a journey that took a week of walking all day every day.

Further, several of his slaves attempted to escape his bonds of slavery (some successfully) and Washington subsequently placed bounties on their heads for their return.

Different times for sure

"43","1461184715","Can somebody clarify on something for me? Im actually surprised about the Tubman on the 20 decision. No, im not a sexist. No, im not a racist. Im surprised because her actions were (albeit very noble) limited to only helping a certain type of people vs the fact that Andrew Jackson was the president. 

But what I needed clarification on was that the biggest attack on Jackson was that he owned slaves. So now here we are talking about Washington, who is on two currencies, why isn't the same argument being applied to him since he owned slaves? Also, I personally don't think that owning slaves during a time where the norm was to own slaves makes you an evil person when held to that standard of the norm at the time. "

2. James Polk - one of the only presidents to fulfills every one of his campaign promises- the best one-term President ever? Never lost election- refused to run.

3. Andrew Jackson - Based Jackson helped bring in the common man to be involved with politics, not just educated land owners - changed the US from Jeffersonian to Jacksonian democracy in the process. Solved the Indian problem, paid off the national debt (I know we need a national debt, but that would soon be accrued after he paid it off) and was the inspiration behind the Donkey symbol of the Democratic party

"106","1461175309","Weird parallels between then and now. Adams was arguably the most qualified man to be the nation's first president. He had a first-rate mind and diplomatic skills (especially crucial during our nation's infancy) equaled only by Thomas Jefferson. But Washington was a figure of unquestioned integrity, one who all knew would govern for the common man and the gentry without becoming a tyrant. "
"107","1461219055","**John Adams** - damn, that's one of the presidents who I think has one of the most complicated legacies.  To sum up my main views of his presidency, he was instrumental in keeping us out of war with France, despite most of the country absolutely screaming for it, and war with France that early in our nation's history would have only led to bad things.  That being said, his Alien and Sedition Acts are possibly the most unconstitutional and straight-up horrifying piece of legislature that has ever been passed in the United States. No way to view that as anything but abhorrent.

Overall, I view Adams as a great man and a wonderful influence on our country - but a pretty bad President.

**George Washington**, of course, is hard to separate from his Revolutionary War generalship, but we try to when it comes to the presidency.  Overall, I still think Washington was a better general than President, and was more a great leader of men than he was a leader of government.  But after the Articles of Confederation were scrapped and the new constitution took place, a leader of men is exactly what we needed, and Washington fit the bill perfectly.  No one could have better served as the first president, as the unifying president, than Washington.  But he also was tough and forceful when he needed to be.  I view his crushing of The Whiskey Rebellion as one of the greatest (and certainly one of the most important) executive acts by a President in history.  In a time when the Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist feud was still strong and it was still unclear (or some wanted it to be unclear) whether we were one country or thirteen countries in a loose confederation, Washington settled that debate and made it really fucking clear that the federal government was a strong government, one that could tax, pass laws, and enforce its will.  The whiskey rebellion is so little known, but it really was a pivotal point in the history of the United States, and a weaker response to it could have led to a weakened and fractured country or to the complete breaking up of the United States into different countries.  Washington dealt with it perfectly, crushing it and leaving no doubt as to the power and intent of the government and the new constitution while doing it with enough restraint that a grand total of *seven* died in this rebellion.

Also, his ""abdication"" (not a technical abdication, but he could have won as many terms as president as he wanted so long as he stayed alive) is one of the most important moves he ever did.  It set a precedent that all but one president obeyed until it became law, and is one of the greatest examples since Cincinnatus (all the way back in the fucking Roman Republic) of a great man and great leader taking power, wielding it as needed to make sure that stability, safety, and success were brought to the people they were ruling, and then voluntarily laying it down.  The importance of his decision not to run for a third term is hard to overstate.

While I think his reputation is a little overblown, Washington was still one of the great men of history, was what our country needed at its founding, and definitely makes my top five presidents list.


EDIT:  Also, just to add on to my response - this is a wonderful series, and I can't wait to see this develop over the coming months.  I look forward to sharing my opinion on presidents that I know a lot about, and learning about presidents that I know very little about.  At a time when both parties are very fractured, I think this is a wonderful way for this sub to discuss politics and political history without it devolving into a flame war.  Thanks for this.


Edit 2: as has been pointed out, I was thinking of the Whiskey Rebellion. Not Shays rebellion. That was earlier."

"110","1461175401","If anyone wants to know more about Adams and Washington in a more academic way while also learning more about the structure of early American republic politics, I would highly suggest that one look at Joanne Freeman's *Affairs of Honor: National Politics in the New Republic*. It's a fantastic book that got Freeman a job at Yale. 

Basically the thesis, argues that in absence of political parties, politics in the capital was regulated through honor and how ones reputation was both a shield and prey in what Freeman calls the ""grammar of political combat."" Politics was this game that could end up with a reporter being brutally beaten by a representative with a metal fireplace rod while in session, or in the case of Hamilton, dead. One of the worst things a person could do was give someone ""the lie."" The book also does a fantastic job of how Washington could navigate this treacherous world of honor and secrets. He knew how to play the game. However Adams due to is immaturity, failed at the game and often turned potential friends into adversaries. 

It's a fantastic academic look at how political parties came to be in the Early American Republic. How coalitions formed through friendships and reputation created the two party system."
"111","1461175988","[Welcome folks, to the Adams Administration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbY6UQCk0SM)!

"112","1461202322","Washington to me is fascinating. There's a great scene in one of his biographies about the contrast of his morals and his failings as a man--this is of course, what makes a president fascinating in my mind. 

Washington was a slave-owner, but he hates the institution. In the book I am referring to, *Washington: A life*, Chernow points out that even though he hated it, he still utilized slavery. He talks about Washington venturing onto his plantation on horseback in the dead of winter, forcing pregnant women to pull up the trunks of trees in a swamp he wanted to convert to farmland. he couldn't understand why they didn't work harder when he gave them food and a place to live. The ground was frozen, and the women were most likely malnourished. 

It's really fascinating considering the man. It's also fascinating given the 20 dollar bill change today. Jackson, for his time, was an important president, whatever you think of the man. How do we separate these men from their morality, locked as it is in their own time? 

As a historian, that question fascinates me to no end. What should I think of Washington? He truly was a great president, I have no doubt about that. But he owned slaves. It's truly a tough question. How do you view him freeing his slaves when he died? Was he a coward because he didn't do it while he was alive? Or a hero because unlike most other slaveowners, he actually freed his slaves. late perhaps, but he did it. 

I don't know. Just something to think about when we consider Washington the man."

As a Dutchman, **John Adams** has an important connection to my country. Before he became President, The Netherlands became the first country with a US Embassy, with Adams as the ambassador. Adams lived here for a few years and was impressed with the level of religious, political and press freedom the Dutch had at the time. Much of the same concepts were founding principles of the US constitution as well. Initially, Adams thought the small Dutch Republic to be a shining example for the rest of the world, but later got annoyed by their obsession over tiny sums of money, a stereotype that still is associated with the Dutch today."

"154","1461432337","If you think shoe prices are going to drop 20% you are living in a dream world. The 20% boost in profit is going to go right back into corporate profit and translate to higher salaries for their CEO and better share price for their stockholders."

'Cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper"
"157","1461426279","I don't really care, but the sort of protectionist attitude is exactly against good free market practises. Consumers end up footing the bill for manufacturing things which are cheaper to produce elsewhere. It's interesting from the perspective that lots of people supporting this company would also speak for the free market.

Shoes are an often used example. Even when they are manufactured elsewhere, most of the money involved in producing and buying one ends up in the target market. Often manufacturing costs are only a part of the price of a product. Profits and costs from logistics and retail make dents too.

The trade agreement has many questionable things in it, but I don't think that it should be used as an example to undermine healthy economic practises. Specialisation is a basic, well understood, concept when it comes to economics. Being able to manufacture products competitively because you're backed by bureaucracy means everyone ends up worse for wear. There are some things to keep vigilant for, but protectionism is often a very short sighted means to guarantee an economy's performance. "
"158","1461426448","The great thing about New Balance is that they sell wide shoes. This is not true for 99% of the other companies, and if you have wide feet you will suffer from the TPP."
"159","1461425724","New Balance is not some benevolent company.  Originally, they agreed to STFU about TPP if the administration would have given them a military contract for shoes.  The only reason they are speaking out about now is because that deal apparently never happened.  They already traded their integrity for a potential government contract, so in my eyes this is just another company run by assholes."

"163","1461425800","Does anyone want to seriously make the case that America's comparative advantage is in making shoes?

Here's a timeline for you guys that I find really interesting:

* January 21 and 22, 2015: Hillary gives 3 speeches in Canada to the financial entities backing the Keystone Pipeline, totaling about $700k ([after previously receiving $900k from the same companies](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/hillary-clinton-speeches-keystone_n_7463108.html))

There is NO WAY when she gave those speeches in January 2015 that she still didn't know she was going to run (the excuse she used for the GS speeches at the CNN town hall). No way did she not know. And she was FORCED into finally taking a position, conveniently the one that got her more votes.

There is NO WAY when she gave those speeches in January 2015 that she still didn't know she was going to run (the excuse she used for the GS speeches at the CNN town hall). No way did she not know. And she was FORCED into finally taking a position, conveniently the one that got her more votes.

Anyone who's been following politics could say with some high degree of certainty that she was going to run for at least 7 years now.

Just because she knew she was going to run does not mean that she was not allowed to give speeches.

Just because people were pretty sure she was going to run does not mean that she was not allowed to give them speeches.

That is not what the rule says.

So long as she did not announce her presidencial run, she did not violate the rules. This is an objective fact.

If the criteria was that you can't give paid speeches if you know you're going to run and the people you're speaking to are pretty sure you're going to run, then she would not have been allowed to give speeches for the better part of a decade.

But that is not the criteria. So she was allowed to.

&gt;""Former PR worker here, 99% of our job is to convince people that something that is fucking them over is actually good for them. The whole concept of 'shills' has somehow became a conspiracy theory when in reality it's just PR workers who are paid by a company to defend their product/service. My last job was defending fracking.

&gt;Anytime a post containing keywords was submitted to a popular website we where notified and it was our job to just list off talking points and debate the most popular comments. Fracking was an easy one to defend because you could paint people as anti-science if they where against it. The science behind fracking is sound and if done properly is safe, so you just focus on this point. You willfully ignore the fact that fracking is done by people who almost never do it properly and are always looking to cut corners. Your talking points usually contain branching arguments if people try to debate back. For example my next point would be to bring up that these companies are regulated so they couldn't cut corners or they would be fined, all the while knowing that these agencies are either underfunded or have been captured by the very industry they are trying to regulate.

&gt;The final talking point, if someone called you out on all your counterpoints, was to simply try to paint them as a wackjob. Suggest they are crazy for thinking agencies who are suppose to protect them have been bought and paid for. Bring up lizard people to muddy the waters. A lot of people will quickly distance themselves from something if it is accused of being a conspiracy theory, and a lot of them are stupid enough that you can convince them that believing businesses conspiring to break the law to gain profit is literally the same as believing in aliens and bigfoot.
Edit: Just to clarify I am not an expert in the field of fracking, I am just a PR worker who worked on a fracking campaign and used it as an example. I got into a few heated debates about fracking in replies to this comment and some things I said might be wrong because as I said I am not an expert. I don't want this to take away from the actual point of this comment which is to make people aware of PR workers and how they try to sway online discussions."" "

"327","1461433326","In her defense, you guys are wrong like 70% of the time."

"330","1461428555","Look how well that money is working. Hardly anybody on here is calling out that corrupt old bag. Yup, that money is well spent."
"331","1461432426","It's weird that people think this is new. I hate to break it to you, but this has been done on behalf of many major political campaigns since '08. I personally know people who got paid to do this for Senate and gubernatorial races. I just kind of assumed everybody knew this was going on. I mean, did you really think r/The_Donald happened organically? I actually think the Sanders camp might be mostly clean, but that's mostly because their base is already super active online. Why pay for it when you've got true believers (I swear that's not a dig)? 

Regardless, every candidate manipulates social media on some level. Even Bernie has bought hashtags (not saying that's equivalent). It's just part of the process now. 

Edit: as an aside, here's what one of my friends who did this had to say about identifying astroturfers: 

1. On Reddit, look for recent accounts. While you can pay for older Reddit accounts, it's not very cost effective. So look for accounts that started within the past few months. 

2. Look for a high volume of low-effort comments. If you look at an account and see a dozen comments that are 300-500 words, they're probably just a supporter. But if you find dozens of comments that are less than 100 words, they might be on a payroll. The goal is not to provide nuanced analysis and rebuttal. The goal is to provide the illusion of popular support. 

3. Look for buzzwords. This is especially true on Facebook and Twitter. The goal is to get stuff trending. 

4. Look for accounts that don't engage. If you try to start a dialogue with one, and they don't respond, but they DO make more comments elsewhere, that's a good indicator. Debates can be won or lost, so it's most effective to just not play. 

5. Look for copy-pasted comments. And I don't mean a comment used twice or thrice. I mean a comment that's essence has been used a dozen times across multiple subreddits.

To be clear, just because an account fits a few of these does not mean they're getting paid. They may just be an effective troll. But if an account doesn't meet any of these, or only meets one, then they are almost certainly not getting paid."
"332","1461428890","My biggest problem with this is that, as a Sanders supporter, if I try to have a serious debate with someone online over who's policies are better for this country, I don't know if I'm talking to a genuinely passionate person or some paid worker who will only be one sided. Although I support Bernie staunchly until the bitter end, I am still open to having a backup candidate in case he doesn't get the nomination. As confused as I am to say it, I think right now Trump is winning that vote."

"384","1461439475","&gt;The New York Attorney General said he received over 1,000 voter complaints, compared to 150 complaints in 2012. Haslett-Rudiano is thought to have skipped a step in a regular protocol of updating the voter list with deaths and changes of address.

&gt;The error resulted in nearly 8 percent of Brooklyns registered voters being denied their ballot.

So they will investigate, see if it was intent to cause harm, or she simply made a mistake and they will access whether she should be penalized for such a thing.

Reality about this? It sucks a lot for voters, but I don't draw the lines there anymore. I know better.

People can make mistakes. If it's simply a matter of not being trained appropriately like most of my part time college jobs were? I get why the mistake happened. She simply didn't know.

I also acknowledge that a lot of the poll workers? Make minimum wage for the lower end of the job lines. That's not a lot of motivation when you have house payments, insurance payments, children potentially, school responsibilities, and other things being lined up in the daily routine column.

In certain states too, those workers are not even paid. They are volunteers. They get payment, I guess, through a tax deduction because they volunteered their time.

So ok. They'll see the data and determine if it was just that bad. If it was? Make sure everyone else in the polling process get's the memo to not do that. If she get's let go? She gets let go and can file for unemployment or whatever else if she needs it."

&gt;
&gt;Clinton supporter Kim Frederick, who created the hashtag #HillarySoQualified in support of Clinton, spoke to reporter Justin Wm. Moyer after the hashtag had been coopted by Bernie Sanders supporters.
&gt;
&gt;""Referencing Revolution Messaging, the company behind Sanders' digital fundraising, she added, 'Revolution media pays interns $15 an hour to troll people on the Internet. Hillary Clinton does not pay people to sit and troll the Internet. We are real people with real lives, full-time jobs, and we don't have time to sit there, the story originally said.
&gt;
&gt;This claim about Revolution Messaging was untrue, and the Post later removed the quote and added a correction that reads, Editors note: This story has been edited to remove an inaccurate reference to a vendor for the Sanders presidential campaign.

Why didn't The Washington Post vet Kim Frederick's assertions before they published her lies?  Sure, they edited the article with a correction, but why did they publish Frederick's lies in the first place?  Was the WaPo article's author, Justin Wm. Moyer, too lazy to vet the claim, or was the claim too juicy to ensure it was factual?  

Now it turns out Team Hillary [will employ the same tactics they falsely accused Bernie of using](http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/04/22/clintons-digital-task-force-breaks-barriers-defend-her-donors)  I wonder what Moyer and The Washington Post will have to say about this development."

5) use these fake comments as attacks against the Sanders campaign saying something along the lines of: ""this is deplorable, see what Sanders supporters are like. Just as bad as Trump supporters. I've had to deal with sexism before, but never this bad."" Followed by fake crying.

Does it matter that she has compromised and destroyed the credibility of anyone who really supports her online? That no one who genuinely supports her can be taken seriously anymore and will always be painted with the shill brush? Does she understand how much blowback will come once 'the internets' would find out about this? Nope. She wants to fight her online detractors and does the easiest, short-term fix - pay someone to do it. Use whatever post-fact rationalization to justify it and move on to the next short-term decision. 

Flip flopping on LGBT rights, Libya, NAFTA, crime bill, keystone pipeline, fracking support, arms to foundation donors, travelgate, defending rapists, cheap at her opponents that describe her more than them, her enemies lists, surrounding herself with sycophants instead of smart people who might disagree, valuing loyalty above all else, TPP, her positions on almost anything - *she will do what is expedient for her in the short term and damn the consequences*.

For another example - in 08, all that mattered was winning. Did it matter to her that almost every single cheap smear that blocked and fouled Obama's presidency originated from her? Secret muslim, Bill Ayers connections, maybe not even a citizen - most of those 'right-wing nutjob' slanders actually began when she was running against him and tried every dirty trick she could find to win. She did incalculable, lasting damage by providing his opponents with plenty of material to her party, to him, and to the country. But all that mattered to her was the short term goal of winning. 


There are so many things that need drastic, sustained effort to change - the climate, the economy, global stability, crime, education, infrastructure - and her complete inability to consider the long term consequences of anything she does means, to me, there is no way she ever hold the highest office.

Her flaw is basically the exact same flaw as many people have with capitalism, especially hyper-corporate capitalism. Do whatever it takes to make money this quarter, care about nothing else. In fact, now that 'Corporations are People', if a corporation could be connected to some kind of Frankenstein 3-D printer to create an actual human being, something that is the embodiment of everything they stand for, the panting abomination that would climb out of it - covered in slime and grinning a jackals sneer, with an eternal hunger that can never be filled, loins throbbing with a lust for power - that thing would be Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Ahh yes, so all we need to prove is full-on *Homeland*-style espionage and tradecraft by the Clinton campaign, followed by a wide-spread conspiracy by multiple state boards of election:

&gt; The reasons for this loss are quite simple. In Nov. and Dec. last year the Dem Party database firewall went down on 3 occasions. A possible explanation: on the last occurrence, a former Clinton employee who was ostensibly placed within the Sanders Campaign staff as manager of their own database within the Dem Party overall voter database, downloaded a portion of Clintons voter database.

&gt; This inside job created a false story that hid the actions of the Clinton Campaign, who in all likelihood accessed the complete Sanders voter database and used that as a basis to organize a purge of Sanders voters from Ohio, Arizona, NY (as well as more states to come and past).

What's that Occam's Razor thingy say again? That maybe Clinton just won those States because more people in those States want her to win the nomination... like the polling suggested before election day? 
"

"865","1461369020","&gt;The announcement comes as the Clinton campaign has taken on a much more strident tone. Jennifer Palmieri, communications director for the Clinton campaign, contended Sanders has been destructive and is not productive to Democrats. After Clinton won the New York primary, a senior Clinton aide told POLITICO reporter Glenn Thrush, We kicked his ass tonight, and, I hope this convinces Bernie to tone it down. If not, fuck him.

Yeah, Bernie, stop exposing the truth about Hillary or else...

&gt;Correct The Record has spearheaded [some of the most dishonest attacks and rumors against Sanders](https://shadowproof.com/2016/03/19/clinton-campaign-relies-on-more-rumors-and-dishonest-attacks-against-sanders/) so far: Sanders supported Minutemen vigilantes, who tried to execute undocumented immigrants at the Mexico border, Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, Sanders planned to commit voter fraud in Iowa, Sanders opposed bailing out auto workers, and Sanders thinks gun violence is funny when the state of Vermont is directly responsible for fueling gun trafficking in New York ([which is completely false](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/04/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-the-highest-per-capita-number-of-crime-guns-in-new-york-come-from-vermont/)).

Why is the candidate who enjoys a 200+ lead in pledged delegates compelled to smear her opponent, tell bald-faced lies and resort to dirty tricks?  If Bernie Sanders has already lost, as many Clinton surrogates assert, why are they spending millions of dollars in order to silence his supporters?

Perhaps Team Clinton perceives on line support for Sanders as a threat - not to Clinton's nomination, but in the general election.  If that's the case, why did the Democratic Party anoint such a weak candidate in the first place?"

&gt;Beyond Lockerbie, U.S. officials implicated Qaddafi in numerous other plots against Western interests, detailing many of them in a 1986 State Department report that called terrorism one of the primary interests of his foreign policy. Qaddafis ambitions stretched beyond Libyas borders, the State Department said, adding that he saw himself as a bulwark against U.S. and Western interests in the third world.

&gt;The feeling that Libya was very small and inconsequential in the Arab context made terrorism an attractive strategy to raise Libyas platform, said Diederick Vanderwalle, a professor and political scientist at Dartmouth University. Terrorism was also a cheap alternative that would enable [Qaddafi] to emerge as a  leader in the Arab world.

&gt;Under Qaddafi, terrorism would take several different forms, according to the State Department. Tripoli not only offered sanctuary, support and training for radical foreign dissident groups, but also targeted anti-Qaddafi exiles, dissidents and moderate heads of state in assassination attempts.  

We saw an opportunity to get rid of the scumbag and we took it.

And before you start jumping up and down saying that was a long time ago, not it fucking isn't and people have a tendency to not forgive or forget that you killed 189 American citizens."

"918","1461382810","Gaddafi had to go because he showed the world what even a very poor nation could do once the burden of usury under independent central banks was lifted. Most countries in the world live under debt-slavery. Governments have to borrow all of the currency they need to run their economy from private banks. The banks create the nation's money by fiat, when they make a loan, and the loans made come with interest. 

This system keeps nations in a permanent state of insolvency.  Since all money is borrowed into existence as an interest bearing debt, there is always more debt than there is money to pay back the debt. The nation has to either run up a huge public sector debt to have a thriving private sector or squeeze the private sector to balance the nation's budget. The only way the nation can stay afloat  is by having a consistently rapidly growing economy. If the national economic growth rate falls below the interest rate that banks charge for their money, the nation slides into a depression.

Gaddafi freed Libya from this debt-slavery treadmill, by building his own public central bank that lent money to the people INTEREST FREE. Because of this, Libya had no national debt. Gaddafi provided Libyans with free housing, healthcare, education, utilities, and many other benefits without leaving any debt to the next generation. Private businesses in Libya thrived because they could takeout interest free loans and there was plenty of business coming from public sector employees. 

Gaddafi transformed a desert country that was one of the poorest in Africa, into a thriving green nation that was among the wealthiest in the world. What Libya was able to do unburdened by usury was incredible. Libyans found underground water and built the world's largest irrigation system to bring water to all parts of the country. There was no way for international bankers to extract wealth from Gaddafi's Libya. They refused to borrow money from them and because they were using money made from gold, there was no way to counterfeit Libya's money either. They were showing the world what true freedom looks like and that's way NATO destroyed them."

So, this guy simply emailed Hillary a theory he had - that France wanted to topple Ghaddafi because of his plans to establish a pan-African currency.

"1022","1461421005","Generation X here: I initially posted a similar response to another redditors comment but this also reflects the main article. 

The reason this is so damaging to Hillary is that it clearly outlines her desire to hob knob with the upper class and special interests. I have had people counter me by saying that this is necessary to follow a balanced approach and that Business interests aren't inherently evil, but that doesn't mean she is showing them extreme favor. 

The reason this is an incompatible view with today's political environment is due to the sheer influence special interests have over nearly all of our politicians. Is it necessary to spend some time with these groups, absolutely, should that time out weigh the time spent on interests groups by a that truly represent the American people by a 1000:1 margin, ABSOLUTELY NOT. What many Hillary supporters may not realize is the sheer number of corporate special interest lobbyists flooding the political landscape vs interest groups representing individual Americans is astronomical. The impact is the direct result of today' state of affairs. It is responsible for the class warfare on the middle and lower classes for the last 30 years, it is responsible for the loss of many of our freedoms, and it is responsible for the mass oppression and incarceration of the masses (note oppression being referred to currently is an economic oppression in the form of heavy medical bills, school loans and other forms that keep people from saving and stabalization and thus creating a revolving door of endless debt which only contributes to income inequality). 

I can see why Hillary supporters don't necessarily recognize the ""evil"" of Hillary attending the events, paid speeches, super pac money, money to her campaign, money to her foundation but the fact is as every dollar mounts it is one more favor, exposure, scratching each others back that slowly adds to these special interests agendas and slowly chips away at the average American. After 30 years of this it is completely and utterly unacceptable to bend any further. So when you look at the shear amount of Time that Hillary spends with these groups vs the Sheer amount of time Bernie spends with the people it is quite clear whom each candidate prefers and supports. 

Thinking otherwise doesn't mean your stupid or an idiot. I get why Hillary supporters like her so much, However, it does mean that they are ignoring the facts and letting their emotions cloud their judgement.

Sorry, Hillary's resume alone is not enough to make her an inspirational figure. Especially not if you have followed her performance while holding those jobs.

""First Lady""... Just cut it out with that. It only tells me she married a man who had potential to take her places. *""Unlike the countless other women who shagged Bill Clinton hoping to make it to the top, Hillary actually got there""* is supposed to inspire people in the 21st Century? How is that anything but depressing for most of us?

An inspiring leader in the US Senate would not have stood by and watched as Valerie Plame was thrown under the bus after revealing the ""intelligence"" on Iraq was faked. An inspiring Senator might have used her famous name/ brand to try to stop a needless war. But she didn't. Instead, she did the politically expedient thing, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of needless deaths and tens of millions of lives destroyed. All so she wouldn't hurt her chances of becoming the first woman POTUS.

A good Secretary of State would have found a better solution for Libya than bombing its people and cities back to the Stone Age.

A more inspiring candidate for POTUS wouldn't tell people that affordable education and health care, enjoyed by the people of every other developed nation, as well as many less developed nations, are the pipe dreams of deluded children.

However, it was expected that he would lose New York because no independent voters could vote for him unless they switched to Democrats 6 months ago. Very few independent voters would do that and that took away 40% of the voters who are independent. So, what options do Sanders have? Can he still win the general election if he fails to be the nominee? I think he still can. If Sanders wins 57% of the votes in the remaining races which is very likely to happen, he will only be about 600,000 votes behind. With all independent voters able to vote in the general election, Sanders will beat Clinton in the general election although he might lose the nomination.

Nothing's going to really change, she's going to have the majority of superdelegates combined with her pledged delegates will give her enough.  

It's unfortunate that just about every primary/caucus, if not every primary and caucus in the Democratic election cycle is proportionate.  If there could be a magic number where Bernie could get the vast majority ,if not all of the delegates in a single state, California might really help him.

If those companies are grouped under ""Electronics Mfg &amp; Equip"" (not what I would choose, but from the numbers presented it seems like that must be the case), then Sanders has received just over $1 million from that group and Clinton has received just under $1.5 million.

[found here, along with elaboration of the activities they will engage in in order to do that.](http://www.dea.gov/about/mission.shtml)

1. After they built the walls around sections of Palestine, suicide bombings dropped from 72 in 3 years to 12 over he next three years around the walls.

2. They drop leaflets 24-48 hours in advance of places they bomb in Palestine, but Hamas forces people to stay and uses hospitals and schools as bases because people will be killed and it will cause public outcry.

3. All of Israel's enemies have openly expressed their desire for Israel to be obliterated off of the planet multiple times.

4. They offered the Gaza Strip to Egypt, but they wouldn't take it because of the high incidence of religious extremists and terrorists.

In the end I learned that there is no real solution to Israel Palestine. Ideally both should live in peace, but realistically that will probably never happen--or not for a very long time atleast. It is better to build a wall and protect people from registered terrorist organizations, than to hang back, not respond to aggression, and let your people get slaughtered mercilessly.

Talking a big game is one thing, but taking it upon yourself to actually fight from the ground up to flip the republic to a more progressive representation takes a lot of work."
"1478","1461333672","That's kind of facile. 

The Democratic Party is a classic example of a ""big tent."" It caters to a wide variety of political beliefs - sometimes contradictory - which generally follow the extremely rough and super-over-generalized mantra that there should be safety nets in society and the government should be the entity establishing them. This takes on a lot of different forms, ranging from social security, to equal protection, to disability support, to medicare, to civil rights, and far beyond. 

Progressivism fits in this category. But so do many other beliefs, including those (often derided as ""moderate"" or ""centrist"") that believe the government should provide benefits or protections to groups of individuals working together, such as corporations. 

It's okay for there to be tension in a political party. It's critical to interact with alternative perspectives and viewpoints; that's the only way you ever come to challenge your beliefs and learn more about the world. It's healthy for discourse, it's healthy for government, and it's healthy for society. 

The problem with the Bernie Sanders-brand ""Progressivism"" is that it's ideologically unflinching. Just as the Tea Party is on the right, what's mistaken for ""progressivism"" here is a lot more narrowly focused - anti-corporatism, for instance. Which is fine. I think there's a place for that in the Democratic Party, because the party needs a kick in its pants about the influence of money in society and how it imbalances the discourse. But at the same time as we expect the moderates/centrists in the Democratic Party to listen and critically introspect, so too should we expect progressives. If there's one thing you learn after spending many years engaging in politics, it's that you're hardly ever ""right"" on a specific issue. There's shades of gray and nuance in everything, and you need to have malleable position which is responsive to the facts and logistics of the real world. Flexibility and a willingness to change your belief if it's shown to be wrong or have some sort of flaw isn't a weakness - it's a **strength.**

**edit** - for clarification in the last paragraph, the Tea Party is hyper-focused on blocking any policies spearheaded by the current President and reducing government spending, and is ideologically unflinching on those priorities no matter how inconsistent they become with the rest of their platform"
"1479","1461345276","Politics is fucked as is."
"1480","1461321683","It hasn't for years. Clinton (Bill) moved the party to be the fiscally moderate group and the socially liberal group in order to have any sort of chance at winning an election in '92 or any time after that. "

"1482","1461363596","Correction: The entirety of the United States government does not represent the values of the American people. "
"1483","1461321727","There are two viable parties in America. If one splits, they lose the power to do anything, so they hold nominations to decide where the party swings and these days most people want the Democratic Party to swing center. This is evident by how it's voted recently.

If these two parties, the democrats best represent progressives as opposed to say Trump or Cruz."
"1484","1461326438","I think the issue is that Bernie speaks for the most liberal of the Democratic party. Not all of the Democratic party. I think he can pull the party back to the left. His message has been loud enough.  "
"1485","1461332005","Once again this sub totally devolves out of reality. 

Welcome to the country people, Nearly half the country will be voting for Ted Cruz or Donald Trump in the coming election. Just because a minority of the liberals want these sweeping policy changes to the left does not mean that they are somehow being shut out  by the rest of the country choosing otherwise.

Maybe people want someone who DIDN'T have the USSR flag in their office and honeymoon in the Soviet Union and said that breadlines are a good thing.  Maybe that creepy rape essay raised some red flags.

"1490","1461330842","True, the Democratic Party isn't any where near as progressive as we would like. But it is closer to progressive values than the Republicans.

With Clinton wanting to have a united party, why shouldn't he use that as leverage to have some of his ideas adopted? Do I think it's reasonable for her to change her platform to his? Absolutely not. Do I think she should at least consider making small adjustments in his direction on major issues? Most definitely. 

It's not like he's been absolutely blown out of the water and he's a fringe candidate. Although she is winning handily, his views represent over 40% of the parties constituents so far. Why shouldn't those people have a voice, and be heard? Why are these people just expected to fall in line and change their values when voting without receiving any courtship?"

Very good demonstration of how the Clintons operate, how triangulation works, and why you cannot believe that Clinton will implement any of the left-wing/progressive ideas that she may run on (even after she pivots right after gaining the nomination). It also helps counter the 'lesser of two evils' belief that will see progressives vote for Clinton. 

There's no way she pushes for the overturning of citizen's united, no way she doesn't pivot and start supporting tpp, there'll be another foreign conflict with boots on the ground, we'll see more fracking, reduced civil liberties etc etc. I hope Sanders keeps his principles and refuses to campaign for her.

-Alexander Cockburn"
"1655","1461353465","Traditionally, becoming a presidente for USofA, requires 1-2 billion USD. Now it seems the price tag is around 4-5 billion USD.

I do welcome Bernie as a single candidate who has balls to get Israel to behave, and get that part of the world much calmer. Bernie is also a jew, so the AIPAC can not yell antisemitism. They do say ""well, another self hating jew"", without any thought about how absolutely right Bernie is.

Most of the candidates do not want to pay that from their own pockets, so they pledge **unconditional** support for Israel and the extreme Zionists, and cash that support from Wall Street.

Historically, every presidental candidate has been bought by the same method, and that is how Israel really gets away with absolutely everything. This includes close to 100 Haeg criminal court verdicts against Israel, and why not their own [much secret nuclear bomb project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIBkRDzffak). Israel even exported nukes to apartheid era South Africa, as *they also had a problem with some people living there*. 

100% of the case, countries that make nukes and also those who export them to other countries, have been severely punished by both economic and military tools. Israel seems not having to worry about any of those. When UN security council makes any decisions against Israel, USofA uses their veto-power to nullify the whole thing. Every-f*ing-time.

When countries have [nuclear doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option) as ""we will use nukes against every European major city, if Israel feels our privileges are not supported by everybody else"", that is very funny, as threatening to nuke other countries, is *usually* considered  a *bad thing*. Not when Israel does that. 

This all has been very nicely covered in the University of Hardvard and University of Chicago (jewish) professors who knew that they will be fired when they write a book, but it must be done. And that is exactly what happened. I do recommend anybody to read the [The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, ISBN13 9780374531508)](http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Israel-Lobby-and-US-Foreign-Policy-R-Wendell-Harrison-Distinguished-Service-Professor-of-Political-Science-Co-Director-of-the-Program-on-International-Security-Policy-John-J-Mearsheimer-Stephen-M-Walt/9780374531508).

From Zerohedge, have you noticed that *all* Wall Street bankers have US and Israel passports. When and if they feel that they might need to escape, Israel does a fine job receiving those who are *harassed and persecuted*, even when the organization looking for them is FBI and equivalents. And yes, there are official contracts about returning criminals to Europe and USA, but not a single person has ever been extradited from Israel. 

Amazon filed that book into ""fiction and conspiracy theories"", by the direct order of the Wall Street stock owners. A book having some 25% references to everything that is claimed, by two professors of US foreign policy, hardly categorizes as ""fiction"". But that is the Israel Lobby, AIPAC and Wall Street for you all.

So Team Clinton's strategy is to run down the clock and hope the issue goes away.  Good luck with that.  Every time Hillary refuses to release those transcripts she casts more doubt on her personal integrity.  Hillary's refusals reinforce the public's belief that the transcripts contain passages the would damage her campaign or incriminate her.

Trump gave seven paid speeches in 2014 &amp; 2015. Those speeches were to ACN (3 speeches), International Council of Shopping Centers, National Multifamily Housing Council, Peoples Realty Company, and IMSMFL Incorporated for Samsung Electronics America.

When some of us were in high school we were taught to be careful about making blanket statements.

Would also assume Michael J. Ryan and the City Board of Elections just didn't look very hard, if at all.

Disenfranchised voters have been loud and vocal, as they must be, trying to explain how they lost their right to vote.  Here are just two examples:

* [Here is an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4fmsp7/voter_suppression_in_new_york_we_dont_live_in_a/) of an entire family of voters who were going to vote for Bernie Sanders being disenfranchised, from /u/Kiwais

* [Here is the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CAVDEF/comments/4cneay/repost_of_the_ny_voter_issue_thread_from/), from NY's original canary in the coal mine, /u/wolverhollow.

Not sure why Michael J. Ryan can't see the problems we are seeing, but if he doesn't that means they will not be fixed by him.

Guess it's time we speak up for ourselves and every disenfranchised voter.

&gt; If your voice wasn't heard at the ballot box, or if you had difficulty voting, or if you were given a provisional ballot, make it heard by those [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CAVDEF/comments/4f451m/resource_for_voters_secretary_of_state_lieutenant/), [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CAVDEF/comments/4f45j8/resource_for_voters_united_states_senator_and/), and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CAVDEF/comments/4f45un/resource_for_voters_state_legislatures_upper/) who should be doing everything in their power to make sure every single voter is able to **""Vote Without Hindrance or Interference.""**

*Note:* Credit to /u/jpriddy for pointing this article out to us.

*Note 2:*  Let's compare one election official to another, shall we?

* We have heroes like this [election official from Arizona, Diane Post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxeyVGrJy5M&amp;t=1h19m40s)

* And then we have election officials like Michael J. Ryan....

Anyone spot the difference?

*Note 3:* and for those that don't know.  Let's connect the dots:

This is the same election official from [this NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/nyregion/new-york-voters-face-problems-at-the-polls.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=1) who describes the purge:

&gt; Michael J. Ryan, the executive director of the elections board, said that while approximately 125,000 were removed from voter rolls in Brooklyn since the fall, some 63,000 people were added

Can't argue with math!  Michael J. Ryan says they added voters, so it all balances out. /s

Question for Michael J. Ryan:

&gt; Don't you mean to say that 63,000 voters requested they be added to the voter rolls, while you took 126,000 off?

*Note 4:*  Can someone get Michael J. Ryan's response to [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/CAVDEF/comments/4fidpa/democratic_election_fraud_2016_evidence/)?  And has any journalist contacted the youtuber Benjamin Gershman to get in contact with this voter?  

*Clangs bell, ""Hello! Hello!  There could be a story here!""

*Note 5:* If any journalists stumble on this story, will you also contact this [disenfranchised voter from AZ](https://vid.me/KKWP) while you are at it?  Maybe [this Arizona voter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqmpcpSpXQg) as well?"

Not only is she only winning BECAUSE of the voter manipulation, but on top of that assuming she is so teflon coated that this will never get out is asinine on her part. Both her, and Bill, have been scandal plagued since the early 80's. It's not people out to get them at all, it's because they are crooked.

Do you want 4 years of HRC in the WH getting new scandals popping up day after day? Then vote for her.

If, on the other hand, you remember the scandals of Bill's tenure, day after day, and you don't want to watch another 4 years of wasted time, stand up and vote.

2. Bill Clinton stood a little too close to one polling location in Massachusetts. Right, because he outright prevented Bernie supporters voters from entering and intimidated people at that location. Bill's strategic positioning at this one polling location, allowed Clinton to clinch victory by winning an additional 17,000+ votes over Sanders. I bet this goes all the way to the top. Clinton should be indicted because of this. 

3. Voters claimed their registrations changed before the New York primary. Right, because there's -zero- chance these few people simply forgot to register/follow up on their shit.

With the certainty of tides, 
Just like hopes springing high,

Shoulders falling down like teardrops. 
Weakened by my soulful cries.

At the meeting of my thighs? 

Out of the huts of history's shame 
I rise 
Up from a past that's rooted in pain 
I rise 
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, 
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. 
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear

I rise 
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, 
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.

American oil and natural gas reserves are at their highest levels since 1972 and American oil production in 2014 was 80 percent higher than in 2008 thanks to fracking**.

"2326","1461429256","&gt;On the Democrat side, the delegate selection process is visibly corrupt because it is admitted and easy to see. Specifically, there are delegates (4,051), which are bound and awarded proportionally at the state level for the amount of votes each candidate receives. Then, there are super delegates (714), which are unbound, unelected, and free to support whichever Democrat candidate they choose regardless of popular opinion.  Generally, these super delegates are party establishment figures like former/current Democrat Governors, Presidents,  members of Congress, and other assortments of party officials. **This allows the Democratic Party to sway the primary election, in case of an insurgent not chosen by the party elite, rather  than the American people.**

Remind me, how many times has this actually happened? Oh yeah, it's 0. Zero times. If there were no superdelegates, Hillary would simply win the nomination on pledged delegates alone. Instead, she'll win the nomination with pledged delegates and superdelegates. How is that corrupt?"

I posted this in a prior thread, and think it's relevant here -

&gt;I could make the case that information pollution is one of America's biggest problems. Legislation is arcane and two-faced to keep you from being able to react to it. Business operations are insidiously opaque, greedy, and destructive while being fueled by bullshit rhetoric. The media works only to distract you from the facts and to treat you like an idiot. Why in god's name would I ever elect someone who contributes to that issue? It clearly shows that even she doesn't believe in her shitty policies, and feels as if people need to misunderstand them to support them.  


Astroturfing makes me angry. It should make you angry. It should make you fucking well see red. It's marketing evolved into something incredibly scary, sophisticated, and evil. It's essentially thought warfare, or psychological warfare, which takes away much of what was supposed to make the internet a new and beautiful frontier of communication. Worse yet, if you actually identify and approach these operatives, they'll gaslight the shit out of you and deny that they are such an operative. These are people who are paid to psychologically abuse you. Do you get this?  

It's an ugly and evil thing, and not only does it take away our ability to take information and fact at face value, but it takes away our ability to take opinions, feelings, and personal stances at face value as sincere and legitimate. The internet has become ""invasion of the body snatchers"" or ""The Thing"" or some fucking shit. What a nightmare.
We should not be electing people who engage in this sort of behavior. Seriously.

Edit - Formatting. I commented this in another thread, but this is a hellishly scary presence in marketing and media, and I want to call attention to it.

I think that if you are a registered independent (not unregistered mind you-- their deadline for registering was many months later) why do you feel like you have the right to participate in party politics?  You made your bed by declaring yourself as an independent.  Like *you* did that. 

Primaries are there for the political parties to nominate the leader of their party.  It's not there for anyone to vote for anyone.  If that were the case you'd obviously be allowed to vote in both primaries.  If you want to vote in democrat primaries then you should have been a registered democrat long before this becomes an issue like it did."

"2597","1461300245","You know, Bernie Sanders would have a much more compelling argument if not for the guy that currently occupies the Oval Office. When Obama ran against Hillary Clinton in 2008, he was as big of an underdog, less popular as Bernie is now, and even more of the establishment was behind Clinton. Furthermore, let's also remember that Obama was a black, first-term senator whose middle name was ""Hussein,"" and entirely new to national politics.

Oh, and did I mention he was black?

The fact of the matter is Bernie Sanders is losing to Hillary Clinton fairly. There is no conspiracy. He is simply being rejected by the Democratic Party because of Hillary Clinton. And honestly, if Hillary Clinton can get over 2008, which was far more contested and passionate than 2016 so can Bernie Sanders and his followers."

"2605","1461304507","First-past-the-post voting is not an example of democracy.  If we had a reasonable voting system, Bernie could run as third party candidate with minimal spoiler effect.

What we should be doing is replacing all party primaries with a single non-partisan primary that all candidates run in.  Instead of only being allowed to vote for a single candidate, voters would be allowed to vote for all the candidates they approve (approval voting).  The two candidates with the highest effective approval rating would move on to the general election regardless of party affiliation.

If you do this, you fix the vote splitting problem and you make even the gerrymandered districts competitive."

Before Bernie Sanders, it was Ron Paul. Before Ron Paul, it was Dennis Kucinich. Before Dennis Kucinich, it was Howard Dean. Before Howard Dean, it was Ralph Nader. And so on and so forth back to Eugene McCarthy in 1968.


For nearly fifty years, middle-class white college ideologues have latched onto this candidate or that, firmly believing that their political awakening has miraculously coincided with discoveries of Great Truths that escape the Brainwashed Morons that make up the electorate (and which just happen to align perfectly with their own particular socioeconomic interests), and that this Great Man is going to be the one to take the country to the promised land.



And its always the same story.


Of course he is going to win. I like him, and I usually get the things I want. And hes popular. I mean, everyone I know likes him, and I know all sorts of people at the university I chose because its student body matches my hometowns income level, ethnicity, region, and politics. And everyone on the websites I visit likes him, and there are millions of people on the websites. (I visit these websites because their user base and content creators mostly match my own identity.) I literally dont know anyone who supports his opponent. (I do not consider the previous statement to be indicative of my own limited viewpoint, but rather consider it damning to his opponent.)


And look, I voted for him on a bunch of online polls. Of course hes winning. How could anyone not support my candidate? His opponent is basically the same as a member of the other party! Actually their voting record is &gt;90% identical to my candidates. But I dont really know that much about either candidate. I didnt really know who either were twelve months ago. But Im super excited now!


The media isnt reporting favorably on my candidate. They project he will lose. But theyre corrupt. Theyre bought-and-paid-for. I dont even read them any more. Nobody does. Time to show the world that their lies wont work. Time for the primaries.

We lost. Fuck. I literally cannot comprehend how this might have happened. The media said this would happen. The media are a bunch of corrupt liars. I guess the system is just as corrupt as the media is. This is not a good story. This is not a good democracy. Fuck this entire fucking corrupt system. I participated but I didnt get anything what the fuck fuck this noise fucking corrupt bastards and the goddamned sheep that vote for them the entire system is broken the parties are identical the democracy is a sham im never fucking voting again bunch of bought and paid for hypocrites fuck this see now there are problems in the world YOU FUCKING DESERVE THE PROBLEMS YOU BASTARDS the people need to rise up BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN why even bother

* January 21 and 22, 2015: Hillary gives 3 speeches in Canada to the financial entities backing the Keystone Pipeline, totaling about $700k ([after previously receiving $900k from the same companies](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/hillary-clinton-speeches-keystone_n_7463108.html))

* March 2015: [Hillary's first campaign hires are announced] (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-hiring-2016-campaign-staff-in-new-hampshire/) 

* July 2015: [Hillary still refuses to take a stand on Keystone, and tells someone at a town hall that she'll tell us after she's elected] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/28/politics/hillary-clinton-keystone-xl-pipeline/) 

* September 2015: [After enormous political and public pressure, she FINALLY comes out against it] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/politics/hillary-clinton-opposes-keystone-xl-pipeline/)


There is NO WAY when she gave those speeches in January 2015 that she still didn't know she was going to run (the excuse she used for the GS speeches at the CNN town hall). No way did she not know. And she was FORCED into finally taking a position, conveniently the one that got her more votes.

And what did they do with it? Well, they passed the Heritage Foundation authored Romney care as the big ACA Health Plan, after not even daring to whisper the words ""single payer"" and not even really trying to bring a ""public option""  and what else?

The reason so little ""change"" that was hoped for occurred was that a large percentage of the democrats were of the various Blue Dog, DLC, Third Way stripe, and as conservative as moderate republicans when it comes to certain issues, like workers and the poor. Many other things but the bottom line was after doing so much, those voters got so little in return. Civil issues victories like marriage equality? the national party ""led"" from behind at best until the gains were inevitable and they could jump on the bandwagon.

I did not for a second forget the obstructionists on the Republican side, and I guess I put too much attention on the one thing that did get done to address my larger point, which is for economic, accountability, and war issues, particularly poor and worker issues, nothing was even fought for.  While we knew the Republicans would shamelessly side for the mega corporations, half of the Democrats sold out the poor, wage earners, and the middle class too. If you are a progressive on economic issues you have one party who at least is honest about not giving the slightest shit about you, but you also have the other party selling you out but telling you we're sorry, we feel your pain but we this can't succeed so we won't bother fighting for it.

Besides signaling immunity for bankers, Obama not only made explicit that the torturers and other war criminals of the Bush administration would not be prosecuted, but also increased the CIA's robotic assassins and the NSA's surveillance of Americans.

Meanwhile the Obama administration was also laughing off it base's concerns about healthcare reform, and filling the stimulus bill with tax cuts instead of an actual jobs program.

The Tea Party had more advantages than the far left does.

- They had an organized party, with well know figureheads and specific plans that were concise and easy to explain (using pure rhetoric)

- For much of their early life, the establishment actually supported them and encouraged them.

- They had money. Lots and lots of money, flowing freely from lots of donors who saw it as a nice opportunity to get libertarian financial policies in place, while having them get in via fringe social issues.

- They had a right wing propaganda machine working in their favor

- They had innate human biases working as a unifier. And yes, I'm talking about race.

- They had results. They were a consistent, reliable voting block. So far all the far left has to show for themselves is losing a presidential primary and failing to get a liberal judge elected when given the chance. The Tea Party commanded enough of a block, that the GOP had to adapt their entire messaging to appease them. The far left has yet to prove they have any of this power.

HRC has practically laid out in detail her policies in the Primary. She has committed herself to many hard-left policies. HRC also has a healthy, but not as large, number of supporters who would vote Clinton no matter what.

Trump, unlike Clinton, can maneuver himself on the political spectrum and attack HRC from the Left and the Right, while maintaining his large die-hard, rightist supporters. Whereas Clinton has laid out her policies in details, it would look disjointed for Hillary to, say go Right on issues (i.e. Supporting deploying troops in Middle East), Trump, thanks to his empty policies, can go Left (i.e. Supporting Transgender Restrooms) and not categorically hurt himself.

If I am right, Trump has masterfully played the GOP in the Primaries with empty rhetoric, energy-inducing rallies, and wishy-washy policies, giving him an opportunity to nimbly move wherever he needs to on the political spectrum to capture voters on key issues, Right and Left. True, his favorability numbers are higher, albeit not too much, when compared with HRC; however, if one looks at Trump's candidacy in parts, his competition is not Hillary at this time.

Throw in a propensity for the most extremist (""passionate"") members to become the leadership and an infatuation with ""purity tests"" and you have yourself a movement which consumes itself.

If Harriet Tubman had only helped orchestrate the Underground Railroad, it's arguable that she is a bad choice, but she didn't; she was also a strong advocate for the Union, was a scout in the Civil War for the Union, and became involved in women's sufferance movements after it.

This wasn't some half-assed decision, elected leaders made their decision based on what the administration and hte intelligence communities were saying. On top of that, there was tremendous public support for it. [72% of the American public supported the use of military force in Iraq, March 2003](http://www.pewresearch.org/2008/03/19/public-attitudes-toward-the-war-in-iraq-20032008/). The decision to invade Iraq was supported by Joe Biden, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, Harry Reed, Chuck Schumer. These aren't exactly *send-the-troops-to-die-in-needless-conflicts* politicians. They, and Clinton, made a decision based on the best available information that was being presented at the time. Hindsight is always 20/20. Clearly the Bush admin deliberately mislead our government and nation, but it wasn't as black and white back then as it is today. 

Clinton acknowledges it was a mistake, as do many other dems who cast their vote at the time. This is diametrically opposite to many conservatives who still 1) vehemently defend the war today and 2) would gladly and gleefully vote to do it all over again even knowing everything we know now. 

So Clinton has some regrets. Iraq was just one of those. Her ability to acknowledge them and learn from them, is a good thing. "

Carnegie liked to tell the story of Bob Hoover, who was a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows. Hooper was returning to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. Suddenly, both engines stopped in mid-flight on the aircraft that Hoover was flying. Using his skills and some deft maneuvering, he managed to land the plane, but it was badly damaged. Thankfully, neither Hoover nor the two passengers that were flying with him were hurt. Hoovers first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplanes fuel. Just as he suspected, the WWII propeller plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline. Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well. No one wouldve blamed Hoover for ripping into the mechanic for his carelessness. But Hoover didnt scold the mechanic; he didnt even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the mans shoulder and said, To show you Im sure that youll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow. Next time youre prone to condemning someone, try to understand him or her instead. Try to figure out why the person did what he or she did. Thats a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance, and kindness. RememberTo know all is to forgive all. "

I love the VPC's DGU studies, as they inadvertently show how common DGUs are compared to gun murders/gun deaths.  They just put out a new one, and it actually shows that DGUs have gone up, AND are now 8 times more common of a use of a gun than a murder.

[Here's the VPC's previous study on DGUs](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable15.pdf). On page 7 of the study/9 of the PDF, they state the following:

&gt;""Using the NCVS numbers, for the five-year period 2007 through 2011, the total number of self protective behaviors involving a firearm by victims of attempted or
completed violent crimes or property crimes totaled only 338,700.""

338,700 / 5 years = 67,740 DGUs per year

Comparing this to yearly gun deaths, you can find that a DGU is over twice as common as a gun death of any kind ([CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm)) and over six times as common as a gun murder ([CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm)).

The VPC just updated this study, though, so let's see what the new numbers state.  [From page 7 of the study/9 of the PDF](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable16.pdf):

&gt;""Using the NCVS numbers, for the three-year period 2012 through 2014, the total number of self-protective behaviors involving a firearm by victims of attempted or
completed violent crimes or property crimes totaled only 263,500.""

263,500 / 3 = 87,833 DGUs per year.

WOW!  When compared to the CDC numbers I sourced above, that makes a gun being used for self defense now almost three times as likely as being used to kill, and over EIGHT times as likely to be used for self defense as a gun murder.

Reading [how the VPC is spinning these results is hilarious](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/04/is-the-nra-wrong-new-study-shows-guns-rarely-used-for-self-defense/), when they've instead proven that DGUs have gone up."

If more people were killing in self-defense would we conclude that gun ownership was more reasonable? The Violence Policy Center supports an outright ban on handguns and semi-automatic ""assault weapons"" (an arbitrary category which is consistently growing larger.) It's funded primarily by the Joyce Foundation, on whose board of directors served, for eight years, none other than Barack Obama. These groups are spending huge amounts of money sponsoring ""research"" that confirms their bias, and he has the nerve to say ""nobody is coming for your guns."" I guess we're just supposed to overlook all the instances where the use of a firearm in self-defense *didn't* result in a homicide (the only time ""non-fatal self-defense gun use"" was addressed in the study was in the title) and jump straight to the conclusion they paid for."

Regardless of the outcome of that race, let us focus some effort on filing general election party papers in deep red states to establish a Progressive Party. This party can endorse Sen. Sanders for the ticket - there is nothing that says he can't be on multiple tickets. This prevents the party from being labeled a ""spoiler"" and allows us to potentially gain the needed 5% popular vote to get federal recognition. Its important to remember that this election may result in historically low voter turnout if it winds up being between Clinton and Trump, making 5% easy to obtain. It also doubles to send a very loud message to the Democratic Party and their corruption by **denying them the win by popular vote** even if they will likely carry the electoral votes to win the election.

**If we are to establish a Progressive Party, we must act quickly.**

Elin Gonzlez's violent deportation swung the Cuban-Hispanic population in Florida more than anything else.

Florida has one of the highest populations of illegal Hispanic migrants (300,000), at least as high as Texas.  

Things change and it will be interesting to see what comes of it, but Castro opened their jails and hospitals and put them on boats to further burden the American taxpayers.  That's all Trump said about Mexican migrants.  That they, ""weren't sending their best and brightest.""

"3793","1461357838","For those concerned about ads...

&gt; This week Maine Gov. Paul LePage vetoed a bill that would have allowed pharmacists to dispense the opioid antagonist naloxone (a.k.a. Narcan), which reverses heroin overdoses that might otherwise be fatal, without a prescription. The Maine legislature unanimously approved the bill, which copies the policy of about 30 other states, because making naloxone more easily available is a commonsense harm reduction measure that can save the lives of heroin users who are not ready to stop using the drug. As far as LePage is concerned, that is precisely the problem:

&gt;&gt; ""Naloxone does not truly save lives; it merely extends them until the next overdose. Creating a situation where an addict has a heroin needle in one hand and a shot of naloxone in the other produces a sense of normalcy and security around heroin use that serves only to perpetuate the cycle of addiction.""

&gt; In other words, if the aim is discouraging heroin use, making the habit less deadly is counterproductive. More generally, prohibitionists want drugs to be as dangerous as possible, the better to deter consumption. Although LePage states that appalling argument more explicitly than most drug warriors do, it is fundamental to the way prohibition works.

&gt; There is nothing inherently deadly about heroin. People can consume it regularly for years without suffering any serious bodily damage, provided they follow sanitary injection practices, take appropriate doses, and do not mix it with other depressants. Prohibition makes heroin needlessly dangerous by encouraging injection (the most efficient method to consume an artificially expensive drug), making clean needles hard to come by and risky to possess (by treating them as illegal drug paraphernalia), creating a black market in which purity and potency are unpredictable, and discouraging honest advice about how to minimize the drugs hazards.

&gt; Although such harm-amplifying effects are usually described as unintended consequences of prohibition, LePages attitude toward naloxone shows that from his perspective they are desirable. The same impulse underlies opposition to needle exchange programs, supervised injection rooms, and prescriptions of pharmaceutical-quality heroin to addicts. Like readily available naloxone, these measures make addicts less likely to die, possibly at the cost of making them less likely to quit. LePage considers that risk unacceptable. Better dead than addicted."

"3829","1461294887","The actual question here is why is the State Dept rejecting the FOIA request?

FIOA has a very narrow set of exemptions, primarily for *classified* material. Government agencies cannot deny FOIA requests outside of these exemptions. And when they do deny requests, they have the burden to prove that their nondisclosure is lawful as per the FOIA exemptions. 

If the State Dept is denying this request now, then that strongly suggests that there's classified information in Clinton's *personal* emails. In fact it's worse than that. The State Dept rejected the request in private with the judge (in camera) and without giving a notice to the plaintiff (ex parte). This suggests that the material in question may be so sensitive that even the reason for the nondisclosure cannot be disclosed.

The problem is, if this is indeed true, then it means Clinton may have deleted more than just her ""private"" emails, and some of that may be classified at the highest level. And she would have  done this after getting a subpoena. This is illegal. It's straight up obstruction of justice.

The Judge gave the State Dept until April 26 to explain itself -- either establish a public record of nondisclosure, or alternatively release the emails. Depending on what they do in this timeline, we may actually end up getting concrete proof that Clinton broke the law."

"4024","1461263563","The Sanders campaign and its fans have really descended into conspiratorial thinking, and its really unflattering.

The original criticism of the system was that the wealthy and powerful use the system in a way which advantages them, and that our politicians cynically rely on their donations in order to twist the government to reflect the desire of their donors over those of the voters.

The problem is that this is really hard to prove. It's pretty close to impossible to show any causation between donations and the actions of elected officials. Partly this is because a lot happens out of view, but more fundamentally, it's really hard to show that donations are causing politicians to take positions, and not the other way around.

So I'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that showing this kind of bribery and corruption is hard. But rather than actually doing the hard work of showing this stuff, the Sanders folks have just decided to make stupid arguments.

Instead of showing a relationship between moneyed interests and political decisions made by election officials, the Sanders movement has decided it's enough merely to note the *existence* of moneyed interests. From this they just derive conspiracy. 

But, of course, the entire economy consists of moneyed interests. That's basically what an economy is - an agglomeration of interests with money. And so the Sanders movement has basically descended into a one which sees the existence of a capitalist economy, and the fact that politicians *know people in the economy*, as de facto evidence of corruption. It's pretty insane. But that's a very easy argument to make. The fact that its an insane argument doesn't seem to bother them."

&gt;Why he might not be the best choice: At 41, Mr. Castro is young, often comes across that way, has relatively limited experience, and has few accomplishments outside of politics and government. Many Democrats think he will be on a ticket someday, but needs more seasoning.

Chicago Election Fraud proof

Beginning 25min mark to 45 min mark

In one example noted during video, 21 Bernie votes were erased and 49 Hillary votes added to audit tally in order to match machine count. In this one precinct, this change from the actual results accounted for nearly 20% of overall votes cast. The actual tally was 56.7% in Bernie's favor. After count was manipulated by machine he lost with 47.5% of vote. A whopping 18.4% swing.

EDIT: This is probably happening everywhere. The only way anything positive will out of this is if people in Illinois share this with their Delegates and Super Delegates and ask them (politely) to look into it and consider not supporting HC during the Democratic Convention.

Sanders has been a Congressman for over 25 years. He has a base salary of $174,000 and frequently employs his family members including his wife Jane who made at least $160,000 a year as president of Burlington College, though she received a $200,000 ""one year's salary"" severance package. If you add in their benefits and adjust for inflation ([Salaries of members of US Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaries_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress)), the Sanders household easily clear the $350,000 a year threshold and are members of the 1%.

If you look at an individual income chart Sanders Salary places him in the top 2% and very close to the top 1%.

Fruits and vegetables are considered ""specialty crops"" and hardly receive any subsidies, diversification is discouraged. Are you eating piles of corn and soy every day? Then why subsidize these two crops so heavily? They are turned into food additives, and ethanol, but mostly they feed animals. Animal farmers then receive additional subsidies to reduce the costs of meat production. Your tax money is making an unsustainable business model, artificially sustainable. It is rewarding big businesses who choose to sell a product that could not be profitable without government intervention.
A big perspective shift by the American people, and big policy changes by our government could put us on the path to agriculture stability. I'm hopeful for this change, but it is a huge mountain to climb.
If you are interested in our tax dollars subsidizing private businesses, you might be interested in information about farm subsidies. You can draw your own conclusions.

[Ginsberg](http://www.ontheissues.org/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg.htm):

* Corporate political spending is not protected free speech.

* Torture, even under extreme need, makes us like our enemy.
* Award back pay to illegal alien fired for union organizing.
* Concurred on no longer deny gays the right to marriage.
* Government should fund abortion and childbirth equally.

[Breyer](http://www.ontheissues.org/Stephen_Breyer.htm)

* Corporate political spending is not protected free speech.
* Boy Scouts should be required to accept gay scoutmasters.
* Women under-represented as managers enough for gender bias.
* Overturn DOMA; equal protection for same-sex couples.
* Voting Rights Act still needed to prevent discrimination.
* Fleeing police is not in itself sufficient to allow search.

Now lets look at one of George HW Bush's nominees.

[Thomas](http://www.ontheissues.org/Clarence_Thomas.htm)

* Corporate spending is protected speech, even if anonymous.
* Government is not responsible for abuses in private prisons.
* Interpreting Commerce Clause to ban guns is unconstitutional.
* Limit employer liability for sexual harassment by employees. 
* Don't recognize GLBT as a constitutionally-protected class.

(the only we can do that is to break these countries up). 

Every step in the recent year or so has been our slow and steady attempt to walk from these sunni wahhabi nut bags. 

1. We removed patriot missiles from Turkey, even with the lingering Russian dick waving over EU. Wait and watch as Russia roasts Turkey one way or another. We pretty much gave Russia the go ahead.

2. Rapidly expanded fracking to be net energy producer and making SA irrelevant. Forcing SA to collapse the oil prices and essentially cutting of their financial pillar.

3. We let SA invade Yemen, because now they look like local bully. Cant wait for Tehran to beef up supplies to Yemen. 

4. Iran Nuclear deal - it's a geopolitical middle finger to SA, sponsored by us. 

5. SA asked Pakistan to join the Yemen was, Pakistan did not because of pressure from US. 

6. I think we underestimated the duplicity of Pakistan and we will return the favor in due time. 

All in all - everything is going according to plan. In this case - Really - Thanks Obama!!!

&gt; Comeys first brush with them came when Bill Clinton was president. Looking to get back into government after a stint in private practice, Comey signed on as deputy special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee. In 1996, after months of work, Comey came to some damning conclusions: Hillary Clinton was personally involved in mishandling documents and had ordered others to block investigators as they pursued their case. Worse, her behavior fit into a pattern of concealment: she and her husband had tried to hide their roles in two other matters under investigation by law enforcement. Taken together, the interference by White House officials, which included destruction of documents, amounted to far more than just aggressive lawyering or political naivet, Comey and his fellow investigators concluded. It constituted a highly improper pattern of deliberate misconduct.

Unfortunately, Comey is a Republican and by all accounts doesn't care much about the politics of things, so probably won't have a problem dropping an October Surprise on the nation.

It should also be noted that this is an *open* primary, meaning anyone can vote, not just registered Repubs/Dems.  Open primaries have led Sanders and Trump to many victories, boosted by independent voters.  We'll see if that helps sustain them again here.

"4565","1461420822","Yeah, somehow I don't think labor is excluded from the simple economic* fact that as you make something more expensive fewer people can afford it!


edited better word*"
"4566","1461429642","I can assure you that I will not hire anyone without any skills, teach them while on-the-job and pay them $39,000 per annum, which is the cost to my business for wages and federal/state taxes, plus nominal benefits.  It does not include the employee overhead cost for nonbillable/non-producing time, which increases that expense. 

I've owned three businesses in 30 years.  I operate in the B2B arena.  Unlike my former fully staffed businesses, complete with excellent benefits, I saw the writing on the wall re regulatory ropes tightening and wage increases and chose instead to create a business that currently does not rely on employees.  Instead, I use every software tool available for tasks once done manually and I assemble and disassemble contract workers, virtually, whenever needed.  It works and it's far easier than managing employees, which, in and of itself, is a huge challenge. 

Will this model work at an enterprise level.  I don't know.  I don't care.  It works for me, the person who invested my green and my nights and my every waking, anxious moment into building a business. 

While I appreciate the financial problems facing a group of people who once were in manufacturing jobs that no longer exist, this same scenario existed when society moved from an agrarian age into an industrial age.  These folks need to transition into new skills, the skills needed by this new age and that are going unmet.  

How?  You use every spare moment of your life to do it.  Is it easy? Absolutely not.  Is it possible?  Yes.   We are so fortunate to have free education online, accessible by anyone where there is an internet connection.

But one needs more than will...one needs to accept that having a better life requires damn hard work to get there, work that means sacrifice of free time.  If you are on the streets protesting, then you have time you could have traded for learning.  If you are hanging out with your friends, complaining about your min. wage job, then you have traded learning time for complaining time.  

The group this min. wage hurts the most are high school and college students who rely on low-skill, easy to do jobs that give them work skill and spending green.

And to the OP who says that I don't create jobs, well, you go start a business and then come back and say that.  Mortgage your home, tap your savings, give up your nights, eliminate your social time -- and then hope, hope, hope that what you have created gets the vote of consumers.  It's that wallet-book vote that enables the existence of a business.  But it's sure as hell not consumers who are job creators.  Voters yes..   Creators..nope.   But hey if you want to be, band a group of consumers together, pool your money and give away some employment opps.  I'll enjoy watching.

- Those who do not plan on voting can opt out at any time, and doing so notes them as ""opted out"" in the voter registration system.

- People vote online, ranking their 5 favorite candidates from 1 to 5.

- once all the votes are in, all votes are posted publicly with only the voter registration number to identify. People can then cross reference and be sure that their vote is being counted as they made it.

&gt; Task force will help Clinton supporters push back on online harassment and thank
&gt; superdelegates
&gt; 
&gt; Anonymous online attacks, from both sides of the political spectrum, have sought to spread lies and misleading narratives about Secretary Hillary Clinton. Hillarys supporters are more enthusiastic than Sen. Bernie Sanders supporters, yet oftentimes are discouraged from engaging online and are often afraid to voice their thoughts because of the fear of online harassment. Many of Hillary Clintons female supporters in particular have been subject to intense cyber-bullying and sexist attacks from swarms of anonymous attackers.
&gt; 
&gt; Among the many Hillary Clinton supporters attacked online, superdelegates have been subject to vicious attacks for supporting her. Even the director of MoveOn, which has endorsed Sen. Sanders, denounced this harassment.
&gt; 
&gt; In response to these attacks on supporters and superdelegates, Correct The Record is launching the Barrier Breakers 2016 digital task force. While Hillary Clinton fights to break down barriers and bring America together, the Barrier Breakers 2016 digital task force will serve as a resource for supporters looking for positive content and push-back to share with their online progressive communities, as well as thanking prominent supporters and committed superdelegates on social media.
&gt; 
&gt; Correct The Record will invest more than $1 million into Barrier Breakers 2016 activities, including the more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram. Barrier Breakers 2016 is a project of Correct The Record and the brainchild of David Brock, and the task force will be overseen by President of Correct The Record Brad Woodhouse and Digital Director Benjamin Fischbein. The task force staffs backgrounds are as diverse as the community they will be engaging with and include former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers, Ready for Hillary alumni, and Hillary super fans who have led groups similar to those with which the task force will organize.
&gt; 
&gt; Lessons learned from online engagement with Bernie Bros during the Democratic Primary will be applied to the rest of the primary season and general electionresponding quickly and forcefully to negative attacks and false narratives. Additionally, as the general election approaches, the task force will begin to push out information to Sanders supporters online, encouraging them to support Hillary Clinton.
&gt; 
&gt; The task force currently combats online political harassment, having already addressed more than 5,000 individuals who have personally attacked Secretary Clinton on Twitter. The task force will provide a presence and space online where Clinton supporters can organize and engage with one another and are able to obtain graphics, videos, gifs, and messaging to use in their own social spaces. Additionally, the Barrier Breakers 2016 task force hopes to embrace the creativity of Hillary Clintons supporters by sharing their efforts and content with other groups.

&gt;Q: (Among Democrats) Do you think Bernie Sanders views on most issues are too (liberal) for you, too (conservative) for you, or just about right?

&gt;Too liberal: 12 %

&gt;Too conservative: 9%

&gt;Just about right: 37%

&gt;No opinion: 42%

In this group, 46% don't think Bernie's too liberal (the 9% who believe he's too conservative and the 37% of think he's just about right). If you momentarily ignore those who have no opinion, those who think he's too conservative and those who think he's just about right make up a 74% majority who don't think he's too liberal. Of those 42% that had no opinion, about 90.2% would have to say he's too liberal upon forming an opinion for 50.1% of Democrats to say he's too liberal.

&gt;Q: (Among leaned Democrats) Do you think Bernie Sanders views on most issues are too (liberal) for you, too (conservative) for you, or just about right?

&gt;Too liberal: 13%

&gt;Too conservative: 9%

&gt;Just about right: 40%

&gt;No opinion: 38%

In this group about 49%, don't think he's too liberal at all. If you momentarily ignore those who have no opinion, 73.4% don't think he's too liberal. Of the 38% that had no opinion here, 97.1% would have to go into the too liberal group for 50.1% for Bernie to then be too liberal for this group.

Does that seem likely to anyone, that 90% of Democrats and 97% of leaned Democrats that don't have an opinion on Bernie would all decide that Bernie's too liberal? I'm thinking no, especially when you consider that Bernie's only gone up in polling since these surveys by the Washington Post were performed."

&gt; Dear /u/happyantoninscalia,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to ask you to make a sacrifice in the next 48 hours. But before I do, I want you to know: I wouldn't ask you if I hadn't already done it myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Please let me briefly explain.
&gt; 
&gt; You see, running for President of the United States is a significant sacrifice. Only through prayer and many late night discussions with my wife, family, and closest friends did I make THE decision.
&gt; And I must share with you -- I've committed to sacrificing a great deal for our campaign:
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; * Time with my family: Spending almost every day on the campaign trail or fighting on the Senate floor means precious little time spent with my wife, Heidi, and my daughters -- the very family that gives me the motivation and drive to fight.
&gt;  	 
&gt; * Health and sleep: My runoff campaign for the Senate in 2012 took a toll, but now I'm sacrificing even more sleep with long nights and constant travel. And the pizza diet is a staple on the campaign trail.
&gt;  	 
&gt; * Finances: the cost of campaigning back and forth across the country for president is increasingly expensive, but Heidi and I are willing to invest our livelihoods into this sacrifice.
&gt;  	 
&gt; *  Personal time: You think of this the least, but as a candidate, my days are no longer my own. Days start before dawn and many times don't end until early the next morning. There is almost no personal time when you run for president.
&gt;  	 
&gt; /u/happyantoninscalia, I've chosen to sacrifice part of mine and my families lives to run for President -- but I think you will agree with me that the sacrifice is well worth it.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless courageous conservatives are willing to make tough sacrifices to stand up and fight, we will not be able to restore America.
&gt; 
&gt; Today, I'm asking you to make a sacrifice -----. Will you join me by making a special, one-time gift to my campaign?
&gt; I've asked my staff to put together these secure links below so you can make an instant and secure sacrificial gift -- it can be done in just 5 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; Will you be a courageous conservative and make a special gift today to help restore America? I can only reach this goal with your help.
&gt; I wouldn't ask you if 1) I wasn't willing to make the same sacrifice myself; and 2) the stakes weren't so high.
&gt; /u/happyantoninscalia, time is critical, and if you will, please make this special gift in the next 48 hours -- I would be so grateful.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For liberty,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ted Cruz
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. /u/happyantoninscalia, I've chosen to make some steep, necessary sacrifices in our fight to restore America. Will you join me with your gift of $250 or $100? OR if $35 or $10 is a stretch gift for you, I will be grateful for every dollar you can sacrifice and will ensure it is faithfully used."

&gt; The provision, an increasingly common feature of trade agreements, is called Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS. The name may sound mild, but dont be fooled. Agreeing to ISDS in this enormous new treaty would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations. Worse, **it would undermine U.S. sovereignty.**

___________

&gt; **ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws  and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers  without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court.**
&gt;&gt; Heres how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators. If the company won, the ruling couldnt be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions  and even billions  of dollars in damages.

________

&gt;  ISDS could lead to gigantic fines, **but it wouldnt employ independent judges. Instead, highly paid corporate lawyers would go back and forth between representing corporations one day and sitting in judgment the next.** Maybe that makes sense in an arbitration between two corporations, but not in cases between corporations and governments.

_____

&gt; If the tilt toward giant corporations wasnt clear enough, consider who would get to use this special court: only international investors, which are, by and large, big corporations.
&gt;&gt; The use of ISDS is on the rise around the globe. From 1959 to 2002, there were fewer than 100 ISDS claims worldwide. But in 2012 alone, there were 58 cases. **Recent cases include a French company that sued Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage, a Swedish company that sued Germany because Germany decided to phase out nuclear power after Japans Fukushima disaster, and a Dutch company that sued the Czech Republic because the Czechs didnt bail out a bank that the company partially owned. U.S. corporations have also gotten in on the action: Philip Morris is trying to use ISDS to stop Uruguay from implementing new tobacco regulations intended to cut smoking rates.**

"5152","1461434024","There are quite a few reasons for why he's doing poorly with African Americans. **please note that most of these reasons are going to be based on demographics and your lived experiences might not be representative of all black people**

* As a demographic, African Americans are more likely to be  more religious than the average American (79% v 56%).

* As a demographic, the highly religious tend to vote in blocs, therefore, African Americans have a greater tendency to vote in blocs.

* Some of the greatest concentrations of African Americans are in the South.

* The South tends to be more conservative than the rest of the country, and it would logically follow they would tend to vote for the more conservative candidate, Hillary Clinton.

* A great deal of African American leaders supported Bill Clinton's presidency (and in particular the Crime Bill) and believe that Hillary Clinton would preside in a similar way to her husband.

Here's the short version. Due to several demographic reasons, the African American community can be relied on to vote in predictable ways. This doesn't mean that they're uninformed, misinformed, smart, or stupid."
"5153","1461433273","1. I think people underestimate Clinton's network. 

2. I think ""Pragmatism"" plays better in communties that are disadvantaged.

3. I think women are more important culturally in disadvantaged communities.

4. I think the criminal justice reform of the 90s empowered communities with funds and laws to police themselves, and this is a clearer argument to express than the revisionist socioanalysis that progressives pander.

5. I think money flowing from Clintons network is more valuable in the south and in cities than in rural or suburban districts.

6. I think Universal Healthcare and tuition free college has overlap with existing programs in the bottom quartile of incomes.

7. I think Clintons focus on Pre-K is far more effective at targeting current needs than Universal College


So I am a straight up Progressive and Bernie supporter, but feel that he severly limited himself in the way that he expressed the progressive platform. He was forced to educate the electorate on his platform, while Clinton was afforded the opportunity to use the Obama+ method.

Bernie was Relegated to the ""Free shit"" platform, which is not what he or other real progressives believe.

&gt;When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldnt even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.

&gt;Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood  both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno  husband Bill described her selection as my worst mistake. Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.

&gt;Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guaniers radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.

&gt;Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.

&gt;Many younger votes will have no knowledge of Travelgate. Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson  and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours. Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.

&gt;Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.

&gt;Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the #$%$ eruption and scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were: - She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones. - She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. - After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.

&gt;Hillarys devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.

&gt;Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, I do not recall, I have no recollection, and I dont know a total of 56 times while under oath.

&gt;After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.

"5314","1461214213","EDIT:

I should give the writer some more credit. Ari Berman is a serious writer on voting rights, and has written a book about it in the wake of the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. As for the 19.7% number, the linked source is a tweet from a professor in the area. The number isn't sourced-- my best guess is that the prof used voting-age population as the denominator, not registered voters, but there's no documentation to that effect. (The limits of making bold statements in 140 characters.)

I still think it's a bad idea to conflate the issue of a closed primary (which was by far the largest reason for lower turnout) with legitimate grievances about voting restrictions, and wildly egregious to claim that New York has the second lowest turnout by ignoring 13 other states that use caucuses.

ORIGINAL:

That statement is wrong in so many ways. The key allegation in the article is this:

&gt;  As a result, only 19.7 percent of eligible New Yorkers cast a ballot, the second-lowest voter turnout in the primaries after Louisiana, according to elections expert Michael McDonald.

First, let's acknowledge the enormous problem that even if this statement were true, it would not make New York the second lowest turnout state-- it would still be ahead of *every single caucus state*, of which there have been 13. So already, New York is at worst the 15th lowest turnout state. I don't know if the estimable Nation complained about all of those, but let's let that go for now.

The only way you can arrive at something close to that number is through some pretty tortured logic, and even then, you don't come really close.

Given that it's the Nation, I assume they're more interested in the Democratic primary. As of April 1, 2016, there were 5,268,431 active registered Democrats in New York.

http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_apr16.pdf (see last page).

As of right now, there were 1,817,552 votes cast in the Democratic primary. **So there was a turnout of 34.5% of eligible voters, not the 19.7% the Nation claims.** On the off chance they meant the Republicans, there the turnout was 868,987 out of 2,554,996 active registered Republicans, which comes in at 34.0%.

Okay, maybe the point is that New York's closed primary meant that many non-affiliated voters couldn't vote in a party primary. That's a strange way of defining ""eligible"" voter, since these voters are by definition ineligible. Still, there are a total of 10,728,748 active registered voters. This includes Democrats, Republicans, non-affiliated voters, and members of six smaller parties. I don't know how many people voted in the primaries of the six smaller parties, but let's take the worst case and assume it was 0. Then, we get a turnout of (868,987 Republicans + 1,817,552 Democrats) / 10,728,748 total voters, for a turnout of 25.0%. **So even including 2.2 million voters who were by definition ineligible doesn't get us to the number claimed.**

Fine, then. Let's not only include active registered voters, but inactive ones as well. Sure, many of the 998,094 inactive voters may have passed away, or moved somewhere else in New York (so this double counts them), or moved out of state, but still. **Even if this case, we get a turnout of (868,987 Republicans + 1,817,552 Democrats) / 11,726,842 total voters = 22.9%.**

Okay, then. Giving every possible benefit of the doubt, we find that the turnout is still higher than 19.7%. It could be as high as 34.5% if we use a more traditional turnout number, but in any case it's at least 22.9%.

And even if the 19.7% number were correct, which it isn't, there would be 13 caucus states with lower turnouts, and at least one primary state.

But other than that, great article."

Oh, here you go. She has voted literally against everything you probably want, but she did great. Ha. I guess if making poor decisions over and over again is justification for greatness, then she is amazing at having the worst judgment.

This is soooo silly. What previous generations called slavery was actually more comparable to modern day business in how they treat ""labor"" paid by the hour. All that changed was the perception of the relationship between master and slave. Make no mistake, we may be free to say what we want, but the hours of our lives we spend benefit the plantation a.k.a. ""The business"" more than the workers. This country turned every ""right"" into a privilege, all accessible with money, but hopelessly inaccessible to an entire class of people. Its like being able to read. If you weren't taught, you learn ways to adapt, like trusting other people to read things for you (agency). If those people lie to you, they can skim a bit off every thing you spend money on and make a living doing it. If only there were a better system! Surely someone gets what I am talking about. When I was a kid I believed all the patriotic rhetoric I was taught. ALL OF IT. Now I know better. We are the government. Each and every one of us. What we put up with is what we will end up with. Its a cultural attrition trying to put a price on every aspect of our existence. Consumerism is not the solution, its the problem. The people that make 30,000 dollars a year or more automatically assume they are superior to those under them, when its only a system tracking participation in economy. Its a tally system to keep track of who owes whom. Good people exist everywhere, and aren't selectively bred only with money. Brains and beauty used to be the things that defied class and culture, but now, well, we are about as significant as this outdated symbol of the past. The symbol meant a lot more than just slavery. Thats kind of a dumbed down version to keep people from noticing the 14th amendments creation of a new class of person the ""corporate national citizen"" which underwrites your existence and records your interactions in the marketplace. Maybe its time banks started treating people fairly. Maybe its time we start banking on each other and trust one another more than the amoral institutions that claim simultaneously to exist to help us become wealthy while taking our time and attention from the important things in our lives. If things were truly fair, the entire system if followed might produce results. And thats what everyone wants. In a fair system our effort and contribution  would be more evenly distributed. Not all socialist-like either. People should be able to chose their own level of engagement and participation, there's enough to delude humans everywhere in our daily lives, we don't need to be lied to and robbed by our public servants and governing body of rules. It is systematic theft and slavery on the installment plan. What happens when you make labor cheaper? Well I guess we'll see soon enough. "
"5500","1461251076","For anyone that doesn't know, Steven Cohen used to run a hedge fund SAC Capital. He was one of the best in the industry averaging something like 30% annual earnings over the last 20 years compared to the market's 10%. However, in 2013 a bunch of traders at SAC Capital were convicted of insider trading. While Cohen was never charged with insider trading as well, he was charged in civil court for failing to supervise his employees. The punishment the SEC handed down banned Cohen from supervising or managing any outside money. So for the past few years Cohen turned SAC Capital into a family hedge fund (Point72) managing only his own money.

What's happened here is that Cohen has allowed employees of Point72 to open a new hedge fund (Stamford Harbor Capital) that accepts outside money. The hedge fund will pay Cohen fees since he still is an owner of it as well. However, Cohen cannot manage nor supervise anything that happens at this fund. So basically, the SEC is mandating Cohen take the same position that got him banned from managing outside money in the first place. "

"5514","1461256041","Lots of people in this thread are confused about the situation. Here's a brief summary.

Vice News reporter Jason Leopold filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case requesting access to the ~30,000 ""private"" emails that Clinton deleted which were later recovered by the FBI.

The DoJ rejected the request, but they did so in private with the judge (in camera) and without even telling the plaintiff or the public (ex parte). In other words, they rejected it without establishing a public record of why the nondisclosure is lawful.

Leopold filed a complaint in response, and the Judge presiding the case agreed. The DoJ was given until April 26 to either release the records (in redacted format) or establish in public record why they're refusing to release it.

-------------

This is a big deal, because Clinton claims that these emails were private and there's nothing of interest in them. If she's right, there should be no reason why the DoJ wants to keep them secret. 

The fact that they not only refused this request, but did so in camera and ex parte, carries with it the implication that Clinton's ""private"" emails were not so private after all. In fact, it implies that there's information there so sensitive that they cannot even disclose the reason for the nondisclosure. 

If true, it means that Clinton definitively broke the law deleting these emails, which would probably end her campaign and accelerate the FBI schedule for indictment. April 26 is the day we actually get to the bottom of this officially."
"5515","1461201323","**Why this is a big development**

FOIA requests being rejected because the contents might contain classified information is fairly routine, especially in this whole Clinton investigation. Classified content either gets completely withheld, or heavily redacted. 

What is interesting here is the Department of Justice denied the request in-camera and ex parte, which means privately with a judge without notice to other parties or the public.

That is incredibly unique and egregious - and hints that both the reasoning and the content are detrimental. 

Now, what we are talking about here are her ""deleted"" but recovered emails that she said only contained *personal* content. Things like wedding plans, yoga routines, yada yada.

If the DOJ made this request because the contents contained classified material. Boom. There goes Clinton's argument and she is likely guilty of destroying classified material. 

She also deleted these emails, and the backups, after being subpoenaed by congress. She said her and her lawyers thoroughly vetted them to make sure they did not contain classified materials. 

What's especially exciting is we'll know why on or before April 26th."

After my friend died of an overdose, I was thinking about how such tragedies could be avoided in the future. My first thought was something along the lines of a life alert. Basically, an arm band or something that can detect vital signs and notify someone if it detects the symptoms of an overdose. 

Then I started wondering if something like that could be equipped with a dose of naloxone or similar. So let's say it monitors heartrate. If heartrate falls within threshold A, all is well. No action required. If it falls within threshold B, potential problem, an alert is transmitted to a call center or ems, who would then attempt to contact the user. (Perhaps via built in speaker+mic. If they respond, they can assess the situation and figure out if further action is needed. If not, they can monitor the situation and send dispatch.

If it falls below threshold B into threshold C, urgent care required, it can automatically administer a dose of antidote and/or send dispatch as needed. 

The issues would be user compliance, cost, liability, and legality. I doubt such a system could work given the current legal approach to the drug use and abuse.

"5583","1461424920","I rather see him go all the way to the convention. I know he will not get the nomination with nothing short of Hillary's skeletons coming out of the closest.

So yeah it is in his best interest to hold out and play the odds, at least then we get a nominee that we know, compared to say September rolls around and they have to get someone else on the fly all but guaranteeing across the boards losses.

That's my two cents."

Plus, the more votes he gets the more leverage he has in pushing the democrats to the progressive side. And he might help to elect progressive democrats to congress, which is probably more important for actual change than having just the president there pushing forward. "

I will suspend my campaign if the secretary will release every last one of her speech transcripts. If the American people review them and find nothing disqualifying there, fine. That's it, she wins. Now she is under federal investigation. I have always believed that the investigation should play out without interference, and I am not officially going to comment on that issue in any way, however... if (and this is a big if) she produces the transcripts and the result causes me to leave the race, I will step back in if the FBI has significant concerns about the legality of what she did. I don't want to dwell on that or belabor that point, but I think it is important to mention. Meanwhile... let's see those transcripts Madam Secretary.

Should KNOWN terrorist jerks get what's coming to them?  Definitely.  But waterboarding is a torture technique used to get information.  The problem is, **it doesn't work**. It doesn't produce reliable intelligence information.    

&gt;In an article discussing the reliability of Khalid's confession and the motive for giving misinformation under torture (waterboarding), Ali Soufan, a former FBI special agent with considerable experience interrogating al-Qaeda operatives, pointed out that, *""when they are in pain, people will say anything to get the pain to stop. Most of the time, they will lie, make up anything to make you stop hurting them. That means the information you're getting is useless.""* His words are echoed by the US Army Training Manual's section on interrogation, which suggests that *""the use of force is a poor technique, as it ... can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear.""* As an example of this the article discloses that although the George W. Bush administration made claims that the water-boarding (simulated drowning) of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed produced vital information that allowed them to break up a plot to attack the U.S. Bank Tower (formerly Library Tower and First Interstate Bank World Center) in Los Angeles in 2002, this has been proven to be untrue. In 2002 Shaikh Mohammed was busy evading capture in Pakistan. Likewise the claim by the Obama administration that torture of Kahlid Mohammed led to the lead in finding Osama Bin Laden has also been shown to be false. According to U.S. Senator John McCain, ""The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times... not only did the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not provide us with key leads on bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed; it actually produced false and misleading information.""

Click bait and lies... close primaries are intermixed with open primaries to prove the value of the candidates. The point being, if all primaries are open, you can have the opposing party rally to nominate the worst possible candidate. The spoiler vote. It's a real thing. You could have a situation where the RNC actively works together with their voters to nominate a Ted Cruz on the democratic ticket.

But if you mix closed primaries in with the opens, it allows the party members an opportunity to voice their support with little spoiler vote risk.

Thus, forcing the true nominee to find support among both outsiders and party base members. 

The mix of closed and open primaries has been consistent for elections going back longer than probably anyone on r/politics has even been alive.

And it's always the same story. Of course he is going to win. I like him, and I usually get the things I want. And he's popular.

In one example noted during video, 21 Bernie votes were erased and 49 Hillary votes added to audit tally in order to match machine count. In this one precinct, this change from the actual results accounted for nearly 20% of overall votes cast. The actual tally was 56.7% in Bernie's favor. After count was manipulated by machine he lost with 47.5% of vote. A whopping 18.4% swing.

EDIT: This is probably happening everywhere. The only way anything positive will out of this is if people in Illinois share this with their Delegates and Super Delegates and ask them (politely) to look into it and consider not supporting HC during the Democratic Convention

&gt;[M]any of us opposed to ""black box"" voting machines know that they have been used to steal elections other than just Ohio for Bush in 2004.

Sounds like they *know* in their gut that electronic voting machines are routinely ""used to steal elections.""

What we see in the video is apparently based on this group ""of 20 volunteers"" trying to monitor an automatic audit that occurs in Chicago. Again from their fundraising page, their narrating that event:

&gt;In Chicago, a group of 20 volunteers from Who's Counting Chicago lead by Dr. Lora Chamberlain, monitored the recent 5% audit/recount of Chicago's Board of Elections (CBOE) vote mandated by the State Board of Elections. The audit is done as a test or check that the electronic, scan machines are counting the vote correctly. It represents a rare opportunity to see the actual, physical ballots voters marked on primary day. as the ballots were hand counted. The CBOE was required to count these ballots using a method other than the scan machines used on election day or in early voting.
But election officials refused to recognize any discrepancies -- of which we documented many -- between the hand counted numbers and the previous ""machine"" numbers and always reverted to the machine numbers. Some audit. One table repeatedly found the same discrepancy and was made to re-count the ballots 5 times! Also, the CBOE deliberately made it dificult for us to monitor the count.

Here's the group's Facebook page which gives a bit of insight into their professionalism and impartiality. Some samplings of recent posts:

https://www.facebook.com/WhoIsCountingChicago/

&gt;Dear New York - Shillary and her gang of Dem Party thugs stole your votes and your right to vote directly out from under your noses - Please Fight Back - Please do NOT sit down and take this election fraud - no matter what Bernie does - please fight back - the rest of the country needs you to fight back - our democracy needs you to fight back - this event today at 4pm in NYC should read that thousands of people are going - I am begging you to fight back! If the people who were disenfranchised were allowed to vote, if the ballots are actually counted by hand I am willing to bet that Bernie won! Thanks for fighting back!

&gt;This is probably another example of election fraud on the part of Hillary's camp - the Colorado Dems were stealing from Bernie but they got caught by the press - so is that OK - are you all going to vote for Hillary the thief - if she feels she can not win by playing fair and she gets to steal the nomination, then what will she do when she is President? - Do you think she will be true blue to you? - Think Again!"

&gt;What was basically inevitable after the March 15 primaries, when Hillary Clinton won all five contested states, is now all but official: Bernie Sanders, progressive insurgent candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, has lost. New York was the death knellhe needed to win the state, and he lost handily. Only the die-hards are still professing belief now, and that belief has crossed the line from optimistic to delusional.

&gt;Theres only one way Bernie Sanders wins this thing, and thats if one of Hillarys dozens of scandals actually materializes into something disastrous. But the Clintons have been playing damage control on scandals for their entire political lives, and the odds that theyll falter now, at the most critical hour, seem very, very small. Barring that sort of collapse, Bernie is buriedhes too far behind in the popular vote and pledged delegate counts, and its about to get worse next week when Clinton runs the table (or comes very close) in the rest of the northeastern states.

i wonder how many people upvoted the article because the headline sounded pro bernie and didn't bother reading the article."
"5965","1461168783","That article is just plain dumb. It's also not Bernie's job to be a symbolic sacrifice so Americans have a chance to vote for a truly progressive candidate for the first time in years. I sympathize with the idea, but all that is is a protest vote. Bernie may not be mathematically eliminated, but he may as well be 40-62 after the All Star Break. He's not playing in October, is what I'm saying."
"5966","1461236976","Well I agree and disagree with the article, Yes I agree he can't win. Yes I agree he should stay in the race. However I disagree that's it's not Sander's job to unite the party.

Sanders is running to be the top political leader in the Democratic party, even if he loses  he will be a major political leader in the party. He still will have tremendous influence even in defeat.

He could be the leader of the progressive caucus within the Democratic party, along with Elizabeth Warren. People are worried Clinton is to far toward the middle, Sanders could be the opposition within the party, he could push back.

To do that he has to accept leadership, and uniting the party will go a long way in putting him in a position in which when he speaks people will listen.

I think if he continues to try to tear Clinton down, and the party with her from this point on he squanders that political capital, not among his loyal supporters, but among the more traditional or regular Democratic voters.

"5969","1461174434","I disagree. If he wants his legacy to be his influence on government in a positive way (universal health care, free college, etc.), then he needs to unite the Democratic Party and work within it to push his message. 

If he wants his legacy to be tearing the DNC down to the core and paving the way for a Trump presidency, then fight on, I guess.  Because realistically that's  what the history books would remember him for"
"5970","1461180021","Wholly disagree with this article's premise. I don't believe its right or honest to align yourself with a party, label yourself as a member of that party, campaign for nomination within that party, and then turn around and say ""party membership means nothing to me, its not my job"".

I definitely agree that Sanders has every RIGHT to continue to run (Regardless of whether people think he should or should not drop out), but as someone who has aligned with the DNC to run for president, he has an obligation not to harm or leave permanent damage on the party going into the general. This means toning down his attacks on Clinton's judgement, values, and character. These are already going to be done by the Republican nominee (most likely Trump), so there's no reason to do this further, and end up alienating, disenfranchising, or fracturing the party base by doing so. He can (and should!) continue to campaign on his core platform ideas - you know, the stuff that got him popular and on the radar in the first place."
"5971","1461179504","So true, better he should fight to the bitter end, serve a spoiler rule like Ralph Nader did and hand the election to President Trump.  That would be so much better."
"5972","1461189042","No, he shouldn't, if his goals include keeping the GOP from complete control of our government. 

He will not be the Democratic nominee. Since he invited himself to this party he should be polite and respectful of his hosts. 

Having run a remarkable campaign, and changed the political landscape here, he should build on that momentum - within the only political structure available and welcoming to him. 

What he shouldn't do is squander this once in a generation movement for some petty ego trip. I'm quite sure that he won't. He's the real deal and understands that progress is made in steps. Nor should his supporters, if they want to move in this direction, and *don't want the GOP in full control of our government*. "
"5973","1461197623","And here's the problem with Sanders supporters voting for Clinton:

Beginning with Bill Clinton, the Democratic Party has been fielding candidates placed further and further to the Right.  More Wall Street support, more hawkish, more tax breaks for the wealthy, more international trade deals, less about unions, less about minimum wage, - you get the picture.

But what most Democrats actually want hasn't changed.  They see the Democratic Party moving further and further away from what they believe.  If the Democratic Party was a sports team, it would look like they were carrying the ball in the wrong direction, over the other team's goal.  The cheering has stopped.  There's too big a discrepancy, and it's getting worse.  To many Democrats, the Hillary/Cruz/Trump decision is between three Republicans.  Sanders is the only candidate left on the Presidential field who actually -  HONESTLY - holds Progressive ideals.  

So what is it going to be?  Do the rank-and-file Democrats continue to vote for the ""Democratic"" candidate - cheer for their ""team"" - even as their ""team"" year after year scores more and more goals for the opposing team?

Or have we reached a point where we say ""You know, politics is about compromise.  But we're giving away everything, the heart and soul of our beliefs: all the issues that are most important to us.  And it's getting worse year by year.""  If not now, when do we finally say ""Stop.  That's enough.  This isn't compromise anymore, we've lost everything we ever cared for.""

Simply holding up the Boogyman of a Trump Presidency isn't enough.  There will be a much worse Republican candidate next, so do we vote for the next terrible Democratic candidate who is slightly-less-worse-than-the-much-worse-Republican Candidate?  

Okay, let's go ahead and take this to the extreme to make a point.  Say you support Jesus in the next election.  But Jesus just doesn't get enough votes.  The other two candidates are Hitler and Satan.  Would you vote for Hitler to keep Satan from getting elected?  Or would you cast a losing vote for Jesus anyway, because it's the right thing to do?  In any case you're not going to proudly wear a button on your shirt boasting ""I voted for Hitler!"""

If that happens, he won't get any support from the party for his agenda. "
"5981","1461198078","Strictly speaking, if we're to say Hillary is the nominee for certain by now, then it's her job to unite the party.

Which will be difficult now that she's spent half a year campaigning against a large part of that party, regularly comparing them to children and belittling their ideals.

The reality is that nobody is owed votes. Democracy doesn't work if the candidate isn't winning over the voters. This idea that it's our responsibility to rally behind the nominee is absurd. The entire premise of democracy is that the candidate is supposed to convince us to vote for them, not that we're supposed to convince OURSELVES that we should."

"5990","1461181813","Actually it is, just like it was Hillary Clinton's job in 2008 when she lost to Barack Obama.

Most economists believe that government expenditures on education are one principal contributors to Americas becoming an economic superpower and helped produce very large political and social gains.

There was no market access for most Americans to education and only very limited access of most Americans to advanced medical care for much of our history.

That was the most informative work I've read in months it feels like.

It makes me see some of the persuasiveness of her positions, but I note that many of her decisions have failed to forecast the results of situations despite having profound access to information and contacts. It just so happens that she continually rebuffs the sources that end up being correct, in favor of a ""muscular"" stance advocated by the more dogmatic and stereotypical militarist types in her network.

"6043","1461195401","He should. He clearly isn't going to win the nomination without something drastic happening, but he's pulled enough support where you'd expect that he can force a piece of his platform into the national platform if he works from within.

"6048","1461241324","It seems like people with dissenting views are getting downvoted. But here's my two cents: I think Bernie shouldn't remain a democrat. The amount of bias and hostility that the party has shown him suggests that the party is not ready for change. They are not ready to lose billions of dollars in bribes from companies. They aren't ready to hold their other candidate accountable for the illegal actions that were committed. They refuse to hold primary elections that are balanced and for the people.

I will take my vote and ideologies elsewhere. I'm sick of people saying I'm voting for the other guy when I don't vote for the lesser of two evils that are the Republican and Democratic parties. We have a movement here that could create a strong, contesting party for president 4-8 years down the line. Yet here we are throwing negative karma at anyone who suggests such a thing. It's gross."

"6052","1461195785","Good for Bernie.  He can use his increased stature to become a more powerful and effective Senator.  And since most of what he promises in his campaign first requires Legislative action, Sanders being in the Senate is kinda where he should be.

If I sound repetitive across posts it is because this issue is not getting the attention it deserves.  It tells us that the democratic party is working against Bernie, rather than treating him as a felllow democrat.

If he were to run independent after the nomination, he could probably carry much of his existing voter base plus picking up the many independents who would vote for him were it not for being disenfranchised, where Clinton will continue adpoting his popular campaign points until she actually gets into office.  Then it's business as usual."

I got on the Bernie train to destroy the establishment not to join it.

Edit: Best one yet - ""FOR CRYING OUT LOUD SO SICK OF SLAVERLY NONE OF YOU WERE EVER SLAVES THERE WAS ALSO WHITE SLAVES AND BLACKS SOLD THEIR OWN DONT FORGET THAT DOLLAR BILLS ARE FOR PRESIDENTS NOT AUNT JAMIMMA""

Edit 2 for people PMing me angrily:  There's no argument that our currency has to stay static. In fact, Harriet will be the 11th person to appear on the $20. 8 of them were not presidents, 3 were presidents, 2 were fictionalized characters (Lady Liberty and Victory), and 3 have been women- Lady Liberty, Victory, Pocahontas, (4 if you include Harriet). Jackson would probably be happy to be removed. He despised the idea of a Federal bank and hated paper money. It's been suggested he was put there in the first place in 1928 out of irony. Santa also appeared on private bank notes issued by banks before the establishment of the Fed.

Edit 3: I literally just had a lady follow me around on the facebook post where I posted the same thing as my Edit 2 comment here (the bill has changed 11 times, etc), calling me a liar. I gave her the list of the figures and dates that appeared on the official US $20, and she claimed that only the bills made since the Fed was established count (so just Cleveland and Jackson). She said ""bank notes"" don't count, only the $20 bill. I actually had to **explain** to her that a $20 bill today is still a bank note, and that ""bill"" is slang.

"6086","1461194412","Confession time. In 7th grade we were reading about Harriet Tubman and I said to the teacher ""She kind of looks like a Monkey"". I swear to god I didn't realize that sounded incredibly racist, I just honestly thought she looked like a monkey in the picture we were looking at, much like GWB did when he made certain faces."
"6087","1461174287","&gt;It has been mentioned that Harriet never asks anything for herself, but whenever her people were in trouble, or she felt impelled to go South to guide to freedom friend or brother, or father and mother, if she had not time to work for the money, she was persistent till she got it from somebody. When she received one of her *intimations* that the old people were in trouble and it was time for her to go to them, she asked the Lord where she should go for the money. She was in some way as she supposed directed to the office of a certain gentleman in New York. When she left the house of her friends to go there she said ""I'm gwine to Mr. ____'s office, an' I ain't gwine to lebe there, an I ain't gwine to eat or drink till I git enough money to take me down after the ole people.""

&gt;She went into this gentleman's office 

&gt;""What do you want Harriet?"" was the first greeting.

&gt;""I want some money sir""

&gt;""You do? How much do you want?""

&gt;""I want twenty dollars sir.""

&gt;""*Twenty dollars?* Who told you to come here for twenty dollars?""

&gt;""De Lord tole me, sir.""

&gt;""Well, I guess the Lord's mistaken this time.""

&gt;""I guess he isn't sir. Anyhow I'm gwine to sit here till I git it.""

&gt;So she sat down and went to sleep. All the morning and all the afternoon she sat there still sleeping and rousing up sometimes finding the office full of gentlemen, sometimes finding herself alone. Many fugitives were passing through New York at that time and those who came in supposed that she was one of them tired out and resting. Sometimes she would be roused up with the words, ""Come Harriet you had better go. There's no money for you here."" ""No, sir. I'm not gwine till I git my twenty dollars.""

&gt;She does not know all that happened for deep sleep fell upon her but probably her story was whispered about and she roused at last to find herself the happy possessor of *sixty dollars* which had been raised among those who came into the office. She went on her way rejoicing to bring her old parents from the land of bondage.

Nearly a million of them held a ballot in their hands Tuesday that listed Scott Stringer at the top of the Hillary delegate list. As the second most powerful elected city official after the Mayor, and as the former Borough President of Manhattan, he's got good name recognition. Anyone who votes regularly and follows local politics knows who he is and what his job is. 

And yet, often yesterday I read posts on /r/politics from impassioned Sanders supporters promoting Stringer's announcement that he would audit the election process. None of these supporters seemed to have the slightest idea Stringer was a Hillary delegate. Did none of them read the ballot before they filled it out? Did none of them recognize Stringer's name at the top of Hillary's delegate list?

Not only that, but the fact that our own government has had this information available for many years, and still did nothing.

Here's something to think about: if we allowed civilians to sue other countries over military operations that affect them, there wouldn't be enough money or reparations in the world to stop the flood of lawsuits. How many countries would sue Russia? Or the US? More importantly, how far back can someone go in order to sue the military? 10 years? 100 years? 1000 years?

The US government could (and probably would) ignore various judgments against itself in foreign courts.  That could lead to foreign governments attempting to seize assets belonging to American citizens and corporations abroad to fulfill the terms of the judgment.  This unlocks the primary rationale the US uses for taxing income earned anywhere in the world by its citizens and registered corporations, the fact that the US government is ***supposed to*** protect you and your property wherever they happen to be, not just within the country itself.

This has the potential to lead to an interesting conflict between whatever country did the seizing and the United States and, as I said in my opening statement, the only way to force accountability is war.

He is right that if we did sue the Saudi Gov't, then so many countries would sue us for legitimate and illegitimate reasons with varying levels of success. Would that happen? Probably not, but we would then create the medium to allow it. Similar to creating the Iphone backdoor. Yes, in theory it would be good, but what could come of it could be disastrous. I'm not saying the Gov't is innocent or anything like that, but there are situations where we sincerely believed we needed to intervene and only caused more damage, and for us to sue the Saudis would lead to almost unlimited international lawsuits. The American Gov't is feared, not loved, by most of the world.

Overall tax revenue is actually still up year over year.  Brownback and his administration simply overestimated the amount of growth that they would see when planing the budget, thus they had to make budget cuts.  

Brownback gets the most flack because he has to cut funding for education to balance the budget. 63% of Kansas's 6 billion dollar budget goes to education which is one of the largest % of budget in the country. That means that he only cut the educational budget by 0.4% to help balance the budget. Also, if you look at the specific schools that are getting the budget cuts, they are definetly not in any sort of dire need for money now.  Mostly state colleges like KU, which trust me, they are not hurting for money.  "

I've had someone half my age tell me I am a self-hating cripple for not supporting their politics.

In a lot of ways some of the ""worst"" (some being authentic scum) people I've ever met have been the most respectful, and some of the ""best"" (some being virtual saints) have been the least respectful.

For a lot of people it's not really a matter of Left or Right, it's just whatever lets them act superior and strong. Textbook tribalism."
"6293","1461295160","I believe this article is geared towards the Democratic Party's disconnect with the plight of the working class.

Is a critique of Third Way liberalism more than political correctness, which I think is not treated here.

When people are depraved of jobs and economical solvency in favor of that elite, the only thing that they have to cling to is their moral values. The DNC sees this and says: they are dumb. They don't see anger or frustration.

"6294","1461297674","So, I don't disagree that smug liberalism is a thing or that it's destructive and a massive obstacle preventing liberals from bridging the gap between themselves and the white working class. But there's a bit of an anachronism here; Rensin is saying liberals need to mend the fence by addressing the thing that drove away the white working class to begin with. But that thing was race politics, not smugness itself. The smugness came after the split. So even if liberals ditch the smugness, how do they bridge the gap without destroying their political coalitions which rely heavily on blacks and Latinos? Demand huge ideological concessions from the white working class? Not really sure what he wants here."

I've seen progressives (well, BernieBros) this election cycle complain about ""voter fraud"", which is ironic since the left has for years argued against voter ID laws by saying that such fraud is non-existent.

I've seen progressives get indignant when a religious conservative expresses, well, religious conservatism - but refuse to criticize the structural misogyny and homophobia present in Islamic countries in the name of cultural relativism.

I've seen progressives snark about how ""unfair"" the rising cost of housing is in, say, San Francisco or Seattle (where I used to live) - but then advocate for *more* restrictive building policies that protect local elites lucky enough to be born there.

So if you wanted to support Sanders, what, you have to vote for two Hillary delegates in order to support Sanders???

I asked the person at the polling site about this - they said I HAD to vote for seven delegates or else the machine would not accept the ballot.

As I probably know the basics of voting better then a lot of these poll workers, I marked the ballot with LESS than seven delegates and submitted it into the machine with no problem. The poll workers just shrugged.

Ultimately - this was clearly an effort by the New York State Democratic Party to fool people into casting votes for Hillary's delegates.

"6346","1461173319","**Call To Action**

The problem I'm trying to bring a sense of urgency to: The speed in which the energy toward the election fraud in Arizona dissipated is likely to be repeated, but differently. In light of what I saw and experienced, the time to mobilize is right now.

A citizen/speaker at the election fraud hearing here in Arizona was arrested, charged with a felony for carrying a weapon and injuring a police officer. The weapon? A safety pin, it pricked the police officer while the protester was being searched due to perceived disobedience. This was in response to the growing protest from the citizens within the hearing.

Make signs to bring to light the irony: a protester protesting about voting rights is arrested and charged, for rediculous reasons, with a felony. The irony of this is palpable, that a protester risks losing their right to vote while striving for their right to vote. Bring this to light with #IHaveASafetyPin **on a sign**. A QR code on the sign, and finally #StopElectionFraud.

We strategically occupy a location.

We then all lay down, especially when police are getting involved. Or perhaps even for the entirety of the protest,  lay down among a sea of self standing signs and demonstrate the sense of powerlessness and the demeanor of docility. Imagine any pictures taken from above the signs... I imagine the effect will be chilling, people unpictured or laying down under the canopy of signs,  in peace and benevolence and non presence, perfect for the theme.

Also, it must be said: this is not necessarily about the disenfranchisement of candidate supporters. This is about to the future of our Democracy!

Please PM me if you're interested so that I can centralize our discussion in email. 

**Call For Discourse** 

I've spammed the hell out of this place trying to bring attention to this issue (sorry). I know not of a better way. **There is urgency tonight, the time for democracy is NOW.**

Our voices must be heard, we see democracy lost in an ocean of suppressive technicalities.

**There is urgency to organize right now, don't let this one slip out of our fingers, we're upset and we need to be heard.**

What I noticed in Arizona was a lot of concentrated heat and a lot of overall silence despite the energy. The problem here was that energy was not centralized. We've done just about nothing to fix this in Arizona. What I'm saying is, if there is a time to collectively work toward something in regards to the election fraud it is right now and being pro-active is a priority.

**Calling out New Yorkers. Who is available and willing? We first need an idea of potential support. This is sort of a chicken and egg situation: how does support begin and grow, and a discussion start and grow at the same time?

When I got to the party affiliation part of the form, I saw the American Independent Party, found the name weird, and decided to Google it to see what the deal was. I immediately found the Wikipedia page describing AIP as a far-right political party, as well as an LA Times article warning California voters not to register with that party if they intend to vote as independents. I also pulled up a summary of California primary rules, which stated that you could vote in the Democratic primary without being a Democrat, but only if you were registered as ""no party preference"". This all took maybe 3 minutes. 

What I'm saying, I guess, is that at a certain point it becomes the voter's responsibility to do some bare minimum of due diligence to ensure that they're registering correctly.

If that were to hold true throughout, that could put a huge dent in the Medicare/Medicaid budget as well. Because while a UBI would be very effective at consolidating and streamlining many means tested welfare programs, it would not be capable of replacing Medicaid. But if such a program were to increase overall health of the nation, it could indirectly reduce those costs. 

While there certainly is a knee jerk opposition to this idea, I believe that the historical support from conservative economists and thinkers may make it come palatable to many. 

Plus, a properly implemented UBI could obviate the need for a minimum wage or at least drastically reduce it. This would reduce the payroll burden on businesses and reduce the incentive to hire illegal immigrants. Which would definitely be a selling point with many. 

So yeah. It is definitely time to start talking about it. And hopefully soon, the idea could saturate the public discourse enough to overcome the initial knee jerk opposition. "

"6453","1461265004","Here's a way that I like to think about the justification for (as opposed to benefits of) a Basic Income:

* The government owns a lot of land. Some of this is things like national parks, but there's also public land that's leased out for mining or for logging, and then there's things like streets and sidewalks and public buildings.
* Right now citizens benefit from 'owning' public land in one of three ways either:  1 - they're free to use it (streets, sidewalks, parks, etc.), or 2 - they're paid for it (fees or leases for mining, logging, etc.) or 3 - it provides a service they use (public buildings like city hall, courts, police stations, etc.)
* But those benefits aren't distributed equally. I can drive on the street and get a little benefit out of it, while FedEx or UPS can base entire businesses on use of public streets. I almost never go to city hall, but someone who owns or buys and sells a lot of property spends much more time using services like permitting, record keeping, courts, etc.
* Basically, the more you earn, the more benefit you get from public lands because virtually every dollar of economic activity is supported in some way by public infrastructure.
* So instead of splitting up the benefits from public land by ""whoever can use it the most"" - which often leads to the classic ""tragedy of the commons"" let's instead explicitly pay citizens rent for the public land they own.
* We put a tax on using public infrastructure and every citizen gets 1/320,000,000 of that tax. Taxing everyone every time they use a road or a courthouse or storm drains is incredibly inefficient, so instead lets just tax economic activity that relies on public infrastructure (ie. all of it). Since the correlation isn't perfect (some businesses rely much more on public infrastructure than others) we'll try to be conservative with our estimates. Itl won't charge everyone exactly for they use, but it'll be closer to being fair, and as long as the tax isn't too high, everyone should still come out ahead.
* Which could end up being implemented as simple as a flat tax on income, and a fixed monthly check paid out to all citizens. If you earn way more than average, you'll end up paying more in taxes than you'll receive (but you're probably also benefitting way more from public infrastructure and services) and if you earn way less than average you'll come out ahead. Most of the people in the middle will only see a small change in their net take home income."

The GAO is reporting concerns on the jet for the F-35 - which is their job - but this problem isn't an F-35 specific problem. It's the same criticism made of the F-22 and other recent fighter jet developments in the world.

A few key things to note is that modern fighter jets are avionics driven. Everything about the plane - from how it flies (fly-by-wire) to its weapons systems are computer driven.

Forget about how you think of fighter jets as being stick &amp; rudder controlled. In the 1970s, the F-16 and F/A-18 were developed with fly-by-wire built into it. A digital flight computer now decides how to move flight controls to a pilot's stick and rudder inputs - the computer then figures out what flight control surfaces to move to keep the plane stable and to maneuver the plane.

This was revolutionary. You could make aerodynamically unstable aircraft now stable, increasing maneuvering to the limits of the human body. It made flying the plane more similar to a video game, allowing pilots to max perform aircraft easily. You could in fact program it to make it so two taps on the right rudder pedal to make the plane do a barrel roll if you wanted to. Even today, turning off an F-16's flight computer would make it simply stop flying.

The issue of avionics not being done when the plane reaches production is a valid concern, but one that also misunderstands an important part of fighter jet development today - it never stops. Much like an iPhone gets the newest iOS update every year, and apps are constantly updated, fighter jets are the same.

That's because since the 1980s, avionics have dominated. Back in the day, dumb bombs and missiles required little in the way of avionics. Today, you integrate missile sensors with infrared scopes and an advanced radar, and even datalinks from ground and other airborne sources. Anytime a new weapon comes online, it gets tested in operational or experimental testing, and then integrated into the plane's avionics.

End result? There's always something new that needs to get worked in. The F/A-18 Super Hornet was developed in the 90s using the same idea - mostly new airframe that used the older F/A-18 Hornet's avionics to save money. Today, however, the Super Hornet has considerably different and more advanced avionics than the older Hornet, which is being retired for the F-35, and even the Super Hornet is still constantly undergoing testing for new avionics and weapons.

Long story short - the F-35 program has had a lot of problems, and the GAO is giving warnings about potential problems, but a lot of things that sound bad aren't because it's the F-35, but the same concerns every single modern fighter jet has had to deal with because of how they're designed.

I can't understand how this can happen.   Yes I know that the purpose of the F-35 is welfare for the military-industrial complex. However, you'd think that for $400 Billion we'd get something that would work.  Our military has always been expensive, but at least it used to work. I'm disappointed.

"6722","1461190672","&gt;despite the impressive momentum his campaign had, winning seven of the eight contests leading up to his loss. 

Completely ignores what actually matters which is the delegate count. States don't matter, momentum doesn't matter. Demographics have been the key deciding factor this season, momentum has never translated into anything meaningful for Sanders besides maybe a bit of a bump early on when he won New Hampshire and tied Iowa.

&gt;Sanders continues raising awareness about the issues that affect Americans the most, whether they want to vote for him or not.

According to you. This attitude is the most abbrasive thing about Sanders supporters, this ""I know what is best for you"" shit is probably a big reason he isn't doing well with minority voters.

&gt; Keep in mind that there are still 1,668 delegates up for grabs in the remaining primaries

There's 1400 pledged delegates left and 4 states make up 2/3 of them. Again this has been a point that many of Sanders supporters seem to like to dance around, his entire problem is that he doesn't win big states. CA, MD, NJ and PA are essentially all must wins for Sanders because they make up 885 of those 1400 pledged delegates.

&gt;He proved the nay-sayers wrong in Michigan, he closed huge gaps in polls that indicated Clinton would beat him by large margins, and regardless of how steep the hill ahead of him is he still has a shot in climbing it.

When you are clinging to the single outlier this badly you should realize it's over. Is it mathematically over? No. But this should be where Sanders movement shifts focus to more localized elections. Because lets face it, if Clinton wins the presidency which is quite likely, you are then looking at 8 years before a new Democrat that you would hope represents your ideals could feasibly run for the presidency. And the only way for you to have those people available is by getting them into the house,senate or governor positions to start building their clout."

"6724","1461182638","So a TYT diehard refuses to face the fact that so MANY of his campaign's myths were busted tonight.

Clinton will end the night with ~+300k in popular votes, and add +31 delegates to her 210 delegate lead.

So onto the myths:

**Myth busted: Momentum**

Sanders won 8 of the past 9. It didn't matter - Clinton actually outperformed her polling average in New York, going +16 on Sanders.

**Myth busted: Sanders is gaining on the minority vote**

She reversed any claims about Sanders making significant inroads with minorities - Clinton beat Sanders with blacks (&gt;70-30 split) and Hispanics (~65-35), leading to a crushing victory in NYC and its suburbs (about 63-37 overall in the city, winning even white precincts 60-40).

**Myth busted: Sanders is closing the popular vote gap**

Clinton will gain about 300,000 in the popular vote gap after New York, expanding her lead to 2,700,000. Even if we adjust for IA, NV, ME, WY, and WA's caucuses which didn't report popular vote, she'd still still be leading by around 2,500,000. 

If the Sanders camp is trying to convince superdelegates based on the popular vote, NY didn't help his cause at all.

**Myth busted: Clinton can only win conservative states**

New York - big, diverse, and very definitely a blue stronghold.

This should also put to rest any doubt about Clinton being a regional candidate. She now has big wins in the Midwest, West, South, and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.

This also calls into question his ability to win in MD, NJ, and CA, all of which share demographics closer to NY than any of his big caucus state wins.

Finally...

**Sanders is mathematically worse off after New York than after his shellacking on March 15th**

After March 15th, Sanders trailed by 316 delegates with 2,033 delegate to go. At that point, he needed 57.8% of remaining delegates to win the pledged delegate count.

After New York, he trails by 241 delegates with 1400 remaining. He now has to win **58.6%** of all remaining delegates to win the pledged delegate count.

Mathematically speaking, his position has only gotten worse after NY, even with his win streak between March 15th and New York. And, arguments that he has a chance - based on momentum - were dashed.

It's over"
"6725","1461183687","There are two things happening in this article.

- Moving the goal posts
- Setting the bar low for Sanders

New York was originally a must win for Sanders (according to his supporters). Then when it looked like he might lose it became ""he needs to keep it close, the target is single digits"". And then when he lost it was ""we knew he was going to lose New York, doesn't change anything"". So once again, the goal posts have been moved, from New York to Pennsylvania. 

But it's not enough to move the goal posts, the bar has also been set very low. He just needs to win Pennsylvania to stay in the race? I'm sorry, but that's just not enough at this stage in the race. He needs to trounce Clinton in Pennsylvania, then he needs to get big wins everywhere else too. He can't drop Maryland by double digits. Winning 1 out of 5 states next week does not keep Sanders in the race. Even if he sweeps the states 5/5, that still may not be enough (and likely won't be)."

 &gt;Clinton appears to have won 139 of New Yorks pledged delegates while Sanders won 106. Obviously the numbers continue to widen the delegate gap between Clinton and Sanders. Clinton now has a total of 1,446 pledged delegates while Sanders has 1,200.

&gt;But there is a tiny bit of hope for those who support Sanders. Keep in mind that there are still 1,668 delegates up for grabs in the remaining primaries, and a candidate needs 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.

&gt;The primaries on April 26 have a total of 462 delegates, and a recent Quinnipiac survey found Sanders trailing Clinton by just 6 points in Pennsylvania, which has 210 delegates. 


So yes it's not over because there's still about a 1/3 of the delegates left. It's just unlikely they'll get distributed in Sander's favor. Even if you looked at the popular vote I think Sanders is still over 2 million voters behind Hilary. "

"6927","1461183299","The state of the race after New York, per [TheGreenPapers](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/D):

Candidate | Popular Vote | Pledged Delegates
---- | ---- | ----
Clinton | 10.5 M | 1,446
Sanders | 7.8 M | 1,205

Sanders is in a deeper hole than his campaign lets on. How deep?

**At the same point in 2008, Obama led Clinton by just 66 delegates (75 equivalent in 2016). Obama ended up winning by 97 (111 equivalent).**

Look at the [2008 Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2008#Chronicle) and pay attention to the chronicle: in 2008, there were 3,550 pledged delegates up for grabs (compared to 4,051 this year). 

Before DC/Maryland voted in 2008, the race was at roughly the same point it is today after New York. Except in 2008, Obama only led by 66 delegates at this point (75 equivalent in 2016 delegate counts).

Exiting NY, Clinton leads by 240 delegates.  That's 3x as much of a lead as Obama had at the same point in the race in 2008. The race isnt anywhere near as close to 2008 as people would like to think.

**This kills the argument of momentum**

A +16 margin win for Clinton  in a big state, and one that Sanders concentrated heavily on and outspent her there by nearly 2:1  kills the idea of momentum. Sanders had just won 8 of 9  most by landslide margins  and yet NY killed that argument in one contest.

It showed that he could not win blacks or Hispanics outside of caucus states, which bodes poorly in future contests (most of which are primary states). It also kills his narrative about Clinton being a regional candidate (which was silly to begin with), and one that could only win conservative states.

**Clinton proved she could win deep blue states**

Most of all, it ends the argument that states like CA, NJ, etc. are going to be won by the margins he needs to have a shot at the nomination. Those blue states have demographics too similar to NY to be anything but, at best, small wins for Sanders.

She's now won by varying margins Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts - the three biggest Democrat strongholds in the North. 

**The next five contests account for 27% of the remaining delegates.**

In one week, these states vote:

* Pennsylvania  189 delegates
* Maryland  95
* Connecticut  55
* Rhode Island  24
* Delaware  21

In sum, 384 of the remaining 1400 delegates  or 27.4% of all remaining delegates  are up for grabs next week. 

**New York increased Clintons already daunting lead**

Entering NY, with 210 delegates down and 1647 remaining, Sanders needed to win 929/1647 = 56.4% of all remaining delegates to win by one delegate.

Clinton will leave NY with nearly +300,000 more of the popular vote. In addition, it looks like shell gain around 30 delegates, expanding her lead to 240 delegates.

This means that with 1400 delegates remaining going into the April 26th contests, Sanders needs 58.6% of all remaining delegates to win the pledged delegate race by 1.

**The April 26th races account for 27% of all remaining delegates, and will be the coup de grace**

PA (189), MD (95), CT (55), RI (24), DE (21) are all up to bat. These 384 delegates make up over 27% of the remaining delegates.

The bad news for Sanders? Four of the five are closed primaries.

The extra bad news for Sanders? Given how NY voted, and how polling of those states has been, Sanders is trailing by single to double digits in all of the states except possibly RI (no polling there).

PA is closed, has similar demographics to Ohio, and its Dem voters are heavily concentrated in urban areas (Philadelphia and Pittsburgh), where Clinton has always had an advantage.

MD is closed, has a 40% black electorate, recent polling shows a &gt;+20 margin for Clinton, and has large wealthy white populations that are literally the establishment in DC. It will be a flashback to Super Tuesday Southern state blowouts.

DE is a state thats over 20% black. See above.

CT might have given Sanders a chance  but CT has a large population that is essentially a suburb of NYC. The suburbs of NYC broke for Clinton &gt; 60-40. 

If Sanders exits April 26th:

* Down 240 delegates  he will need 61.8% of all remaining delegates
* Down 270 delegates  he will need 63.3% of all remaining delegates
* Down 300 delegates  he will need 64.8% of all remaining delegates

**If Democrat races were winner take all, Clinton would be on the cusp of clinching the nomination tonight**

If proportional allocation werent used, Sanders would have essentially bowed out tonight. If Clintons wins were winner take all, shed be leading 1906-745, or +1161, not by just 240 delegates.

Finally...

**Sanders is mathematically worse off after New York than after his shellacking on March 15th**

After March 15th, Sanders trailed by 316 delegates with 2,033 delegate to go. At that point, he needed 57.8% of remaining delegates to win the pledged delegate count.

After New York, he trails by 241 delegates with 1400 remaining. He now has to win **58.6%** of all remaining delegates to win the pledged delegate count.

Despite his massive win streak, he's actually worse off now than he was after Super Tuesday 2. And as New York shows, Clinton has favorable states left too

And how did Harry come to DC as a man of modest wealth but he's now worth around $20M. And who beat him up last year too?"
"6947","1461192923","I don't know if a mass movement is being born or not, but there is a system being put into play to gather u p all the Sanders Supporters and herd the back to the Democratic party.  A lot of organizations and websites signing up anyone they can.

That being said, I'd rather have a lot more Kasich's in office than Cruz's.

While I would never vote for the man, he is at least somewhat pragmatic. He brings a little sanity back to the party."

"6963","1461208239","The GOP likes ideas, just it prefers really bad ones that have little relationship to reality."

By the way he thinks Republicans are out of ideas."

"6966","1461211582","I don't even know what the GOP stands for anymore. They're really effective at telling everyone what they oppose, but not what they support."

"6975","1461263071","To be fair, there's precedent behind not allowing ""grown, adult men"" into bathrooms with little boys, too. But what are you going to do? People have to use the bathroom. Prosecute people who victimize kids. Hey, Cruz is a Senator, lots of ""open secrets"" in DC - I'm sure he's aware of people among his ""set"" that should be prosecuted for victimizing young people - let's start there, eh?

I really did see this headline, hoping he was going to say ""Have we gone stark raving nuts..."" that we as Americans are too inept to figure out bathroom usage without politicians legislating every aspect of it.

But alas."
"6976","1461262423","It's pretty sad that his candidacy has devolved to the point where he's picking on trannies to muster support. "
"6977","1461262162","He is basically saying that all adult men are pedophiles who will go to the bathroom to stare at or commit wrongful acts towards little girls. Categorizing an entire group based on the few bad ones out there (Trump on muslims ringing a bell?)..."

When she arrived at the Queens County Board of Elections, her request for a court order was denied. A closer look at her 2004 registration revealed that her signature had been forged next to the box checked Republican. The judge's decision was ultimately reversed.

Holy shit.  Election Fraud at it finest."
"6983","1461184743","&gt; At P.S. 154 in Harlem, multiple registered voters told reporters that they weren't on the list. Asked why, site coordinator Deidre Rock said, ""I have no idea. It's just a one day job for me. I have no control over what's in the book.""

"6984","1461207791","In the General Election, I can vote for whoever I want, regardless of the Party they are affiliated with.

The Primaries should be no different.

Why can't it be this way?"
"6985","1461202201","I can't tell what would be worse, if there's something criminal going on or just plain incompetence."
"6986","1461182999","For context, in 2008, 186,000 people voted in the primaries and 460,000 voted in the general.  So they're using 34% of the GE polling stations to handle ~40% of the GE vote."
"6987","1461185293","&gt; Marion said that despite his cautious optimism about next weeks vote, its still disconcerting to know that the executive director  who is charged with making sure the election day runs smoothly  is on an unpaid suspension on primary day.

How is this guy still cautiously optimistic? And why was the executive director suspended?"
"6988","1461182315","&gt; The R.I. Board of Elections plans to open only 144 of Rhode Islands 419 polling places for the April 26 primary, cutting the number by two-thirds compared with a typical November election, **which will reduce the cost of administering the vote.**

Sounds familiar. Also, to be clear, this is 1/3 of the polling locations compared to what is used in the *general election*. The problem is voters don't know, so we will wait to see if it proceeds smoothly, which considering recent elections seems unlikely."

"6990","1461184573","Rhode Island is tiny, 144 polling locations is more than enough. "
"6991","1461184702","The results of New York probably decreased the number of likely primary voters across the board for subsequent states, especially small ones that won't receive much campaign focus. Clinton doesn't really need RI and Sanders will be forced to go hard in PA and MD instead. 

Also, how hard and expensive can it be for the state to use the postal service to put a 3x5 card in every mailbox that says ""Some voting locations are closed this year! Check so-and-so.com to see where to vote.""?"
"6992","1461197868","Every state, after observing every previous state's election debacles, is still committed to their lack of commitment to genuine democracy. ""To cut costs.""

An old Pogo quote comes to mind. "

Lol, he's got my vote.  "
"6995","1461270592","The ONLY reason I want Trump to win Indiana is just to see how Ted Cruz spins it.  I still remember Marco Rubio's 3rd place victory speech in Iowa, or when John Kasich lost in a landslide in New Hampshire by like 20%, yet he gave a 1st place victory speech.  I still remember Ted Cruz a month ago telling John Kasich to drop out because he has been ""Mathematically eliminated,"" only to see him just yesterday say he is not dropping out even though he has now been mathematically eliminated.

Oh, the amount of denial this election has been wonderful and cringey all at the same time.  I just can't wait to see how the media and Ted Cruz is going to possibly spin an Indiana loss."

If he continues to imply that Clinton is a corrupt tool of wall street and fossil fuel then his ego and personal ambition will destroy everything good his campaign has accomplished.

He has brought a lot of young people into the electoral process, but will leave them feeling alienated from the process they believe betrayed them.  He promoted a progressive agenda but is burying it in vicious personal attacks and smears.

When she asked to see the documents, it was discovered that a form showing the change had a signature that was definitely not hers. In the photo above, you can see a comparison of the two signatures.

She represents the new Democratic Party that has jettisoned the working class and the New Deal politics since Bill Clinton  ( a must  read: Listen, Liberal by Thomas Frank or What ever happened to the Party of the People).

This is why I cannot understand any reason Bernie should sacrifice what he stands for and endorse (let alone campaign for) Hillary.  What would that do to his core supporters. The movement would be demoralized perhaps beyond repair.  The candidate everyone trusted now throws it all aside - a higher truth thrown aside by the political good manners of supporting your rival.

How can someone who equates their economic values (calling them correctly moral values) and concern for the majority of people here and around the world, a belief he shares with the Pope, now say he supports Clinton  -- which means her values -- immoral ones.  And he sacrificed several days of campaigning to do what he knew he had to do -- as the most important thing he could do: go to Rome.  

And remember, Sanders has pointed out that change comes from the bottom and there is no need to go thru the list (he does not mention the anti-Vietnam war movement but that and civil rights spurred on many of the other fights for democratic rights in the 1960's - 70's.  

And the presidents during those periods were not those that would back these positions -- just look at the history.  The government may be the mechanism that puts the change in place but only because it is forced to by the massive support for these positions -- whether in the streets, thru union action, and sometimes thru revolution (we have had 2 of them if you count the civil war which was really the second part of the American Revolution).

If you want a president  that represents militarism, the one percent, the continuator of the new democratic party, then you will want Bernie to support and campaign for Hillary.  

Finally, keep in mind the impossibility of really reforming the Democratic Party from top to bottom.  All parties in this country have been formed from protest parties and protest movements. 

And don't think Hillary will support any major changes to the status quo.  And it doesn't matter a hoot what the party platform says.  Its worth fighting for at the convention - to get out Sander's positions, but not with any hope they will be followed.

Make sure you vote in your local elections if you want to see candidates that represent you. Heck, email, write to, or even tweet at local politicians.

&gt; It is the correct point. I believe that starting yesterday, the Democratic Party has got to start planting flags in all of those states. Now, they may not win it in 2016 or 2018. But you're never going to win it unless you begin somewhere, unless you mobilize the grassroots in those states, come forward with good, strong candidates.

Also, his argument that these aren't GE election states doesn't hold water: Why play up wins in Wyoming and Idaho if those states similarly would never vote Dem in the GE?

"7225","1461195272","Lol at the downvotes being thrown at this thread. They don't change these facts though.

**FACT: Sanders is in a worse position today than he was after Super Tuesday 2**

After Super Tuesday 2, Sanders was down 316 delegates with 2,033 left. He only needed to win 57.8% of all remaining delegates to win by 1.

Today, Sanders is down 240 with 1400 remaining. He has to win 58.6% of all remaining delegates.

His math got worse **despite** winning 8 of the last 10 contests, most of which were in landslide fashion.

**FACT: Clinton is favored in all four states that have been polled next week**

Recent polls in PA, CT, DE, and MD - all of which came out in the past two days - have Clinton in high single digit or double digit leads in those states.

**FACT: Four of the next five states are closed primaries. The next five states account for over 27% of all remaining delegates**

PA (189 delegates), MD (95), CT (55), RI (24), and DE (21) account for 384 of the remaining 1400 delegates. All but RI are closed primaries.

**FACT: A delegate tie after April 26th puts Sanders in an even worse spot than he is in today**

* If Sanders ends April 26th down 240 delegates, meaning no change from today, he needs 61.8% of all remaining delegates. That's a larger % of victory than any of his primary states that wasn't Vermont.
* If Sanders ends April 26th down 270 delegates, meaning losing the same amount as he did in NY which had only 2/3rds the delegates, he needs 63.3% of all remaining delegates. That's bigger than the average % of all his caucus victories.
* If Sanders ends April 26th down 300 delegates, which is possible if the current polling is accurate (MD looks like it will be a blood bath), he will need **64.8%** of all remaining delegates. That's a bigger % than Obama beat the corpse of McCain in 2008 by in California in the general."

It didn't make any difference then, of course, as Carter lost by a landslide.

3rd party candidates can make a difference, though.   Bill Clinton was elected because Ross Perot siphoned off enough GOP votes.

And George Bush would have been defeated had Nader supporters in Florida voted for Gore.  You can talk all you want about election fraud, the fact remains that the 3% that went for Nader would have tipped the election to Gore, and the world today would be a different place.

Think about that before you vote.  Remember, a Republican in the White House means that ""legalized"" pot will go away.  All it takes is one executive order to enforce existing FEDERAL marijuana laws, and pot dispensaries in Colorado and wherever will be raided by the DEA and the owners put in jail for very long sentences.

NYC has 4,475,157 registered voters [as of April 2016](http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_apr16.pdf). Divide that number by 365 and you get 12,260 people with the same birthday for any given day of the year.

&gt;""The soonest that a new $20 note will be issued is 2030,"" the source said, citing a lengthy process convened by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence steering committee, which includes representatives from the U.S. Secret Service, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve.

&gt;Future Treasury Secretaries -- of which there will be several -- could reverse or alter the decision regarding the $20, making Lew's announcement far less of a clear-cut victory for the movement pushing to place a woman on American currency. 

Following that story, a poll was conducted about which woman people would like to see on the twenty. Harriet Tubman won... and now suddenly, CNN is reporting things as though all of this is set in stone.

This story is essentially clickbait."

The fact that they bother to bring up the negative issues surrounding her may indicate that they're not going easy on her on the surface but that simple fact alone does not prove fair coverage. Where you really see them going soft on her is with respect to the explanations she gives, or the fact that they will bring up an negative issue and then go into almost no detail regarding the implications. The Clinton campaign gives answers that no self respecting journalist would accept from any other candidate. When Bernie gives a vague answer they press him repeatedly to go into specifics (and rightly so). When Clinton gives a vague answer (or worse, one that is a flat out deflection) they accept it and move on to something else almost immediately. It's like they're afraid of her.

At the time of this article NY was still apart of that, he has now lost that state and it makes the remaining 4 even more important. He really can't afford to lose any of these states.

There were three lines at my polling place and the line next to me had 4 people aged 20ish get absurdly angry even after they themselves said they had mailed in party paperwork 2 days before to the worker. All of them stomped out without voting because of ""fraud"". Later a friend on FB whine about how she wasn't allowed to vote and democracy was broken because she's an independent and refuses to declare democrat to vote for Bernie. Do these people know what a primary is? It's how a PARTY SELECTS THEIR CANDIDATE. You want to be in on that? Be in the party or shut up and wait for November. 

The best part is when I asked for a paper ballot because I was voting out of district (I live in Queens but I work in Manhattan and was voting on my lunch), the handed me a democratic ballot without asking. I asked for a republican ballot and was told 'they were out'. I said I refused to believe that and she had a pack of them, still shrinkwrapped RIGHT THERE. The best part was she didn't even try to make a show of it and go ""oh here's some!"" or something. She rolled her eyes and me, slapped one down and said ""next."""

As a result, you had ridiculously long lines at most voting locations, people waiting hours to vote and because the presidential preference poll was done before the caucus, people--if they actually stayed in line to vote--didn't stick around to caucus. This, to me, displays a combination of malice by the GOP and a bit of ineptitude from the Dems.

I am not an election law lawyer but I am an attorney who frequently appears in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.

As you can see from the linked order by Judge Seybert, the marking is ""TRO application denied.""  That means none of the initial relief sought by the plaintiffs was granted. That means the situation continues as if the lawsuit was never filed.

  That was the law on Monday before the lawsuit was filed and it is still the law on Tuesday afternoon after the plaintiffs were completely shut out.

Yes, the lawsuit continues, but that was not the question Judge Seybert was considering at the hearing today and the case was sent back to a different District Court Judge ([Sandra J. Feuerstein](https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-sandra-j-feuerstein)) where the case will proceed on a regular track and, following the filing of an amended complaint, the Boards of Elections of every New York county will move to dismiss.

This was not a ""win"" for Bernie Sanders supporters by any definition of the word and I don't know which is worse, the misleading headline or the redditors so willing to swallow that misleading headline as the truth.

**Edit**:  Thanks for the gold kind stranger.  Permit me to take this opportunity to apologize for my last sentence about ""redditors so willing to swallow misleading headlines.""  One commentor called me a ""dismissive jerk"" for that and, having thought better of it, I plead guilty as charged.  All of us depend on accurate reportage on subjects we are not formally trained on, and it was wrong of me to blame the readers rather the author for failing to understand what actually transpired in the United States District Court today.  My anger was misdirected and for that I take full responsibility."
"7811","1461105604","Why does this have to be a win for one politician or another? Can't it just be good?"
"7812","1461095244","Wasn't this like, the opposite of what Bernie Supporters wanted, how is this title accurate at all?

It basically means anyone who was purged unintentionally can... more or less go through exactly the same process they would have gone through had the lawsuit never even happened."
"7813","1461104115","How is this a win for Bernie Sanders? This is a win for anyone who had their registration changed regardless of what changed it."
"7814","1461095888","Do you remember the days back when you didn't need a court order to vote? "
"7815","1461095081","The lawsuit still stands but the court hearing has been postponed. Reporter is present at the hearing - https://twitter.com/JordanChariton/status/722501669880115201

-

So - if you were ""purged"" (did everything right, but got ""magically"" switched to independent or republican or are not even in the system) you CAN get a court order to still vote. Demand a court order at your polling place. 

If that doesn't work __demand__ a provisional ballot and fill out and sign __the affidavit__. The lawsuit still stands and your vote may still be counted!

If you didn't register in time or change your party affiliation to Dem in time - you can fill out the provisional ballot but __don't fill out the affidavit__. But chances of it being counted are very low so only do it if there is no line behind you."
"7816","1461109710","So to be clear, how is this a win for Bernie Sanders Supporters?

Democratic and Republican voters, who PROPERLY registered to vote, are still able to vote after signing an afadavit stating that to the best of their knowledge it is not their fault they are not on the voter roll.

If the discrepancy is the fault of the state, their vote will be counted.  If not, it won't.

so basically THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PROCESS AND NOTHING CHANGED!  

Why is this even a headline?  Judge affirms process for voters already exists, recommends using that.  How hard is that?"
"7817","1461108714","This is a win for Clinton supporters.  A win for Sanders supporters would be letting independents vote.

The long time democrats who had their affiliation switched are statistically Clinton supporters.  "
"7818","1461114771","The title is misleading as hell, and it would be a win for Clinton"
"7819","1461096325","The update is that there is no update. Everything is proceeding as before."
"7820","1461095136","The article doesn't appear to support anything in the headline.

Another day on /r/politics I suppose."
"7821","1461111687","This is heavily-favored Clinton territory. How this is framed as a win for Bernie is baffling. "
"7822","1461101384","How is this different than the existing law in NY?  They can still vote now if they believe they were erroneously removed from the rolls or party changed, they fill out a provisional ballot.  "
"7823","1461109711","Wouldn't most long registered democrats who had their party purged more likely be Hillary supporters than new independents who registered recently or am I missing something?"
"7824","1461110307","So if you didn't bother to register at all, you're still out of luck.  Thanks and remember to register on time next time. "
"7825","1461111079","This is like one of those Bernie primary losses that were really wins because reasons."
"7826","1461111114","Is there a source that says that Sanders' supporters were unproportionately purged from voter rolls? Shouldn't this just be a Win for voters in general?"
"7827","1461111154","Why were the purges seen as specifically anti-bernie sanders?"
"7828","1461111650","I really wish people would understand that the DNC is not the organization that maintains the voter rolls.  It is the State Board of Elections"
"7829","1461115613","You guys know this is a win for Hillary Clinton right? The demographic for these voters are 

1.) Registered Democrats 

2.) people who have voted before 

3.) those who have not voted for the last two national elections (as in they voted at a minimum 6 years ago)

4.) Brooklyn, Hillary is winning 60-40 in King County right now

Obviously this is a good result, but in terms of the Democratic election, this is actually a win for Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders"
"7830","1461108837","&gt;The ruling was seen as a win for supporters of Bernie Sanders, who said the actions disproportionately targeted them.

I don't get it (not American), can someone ELI5 to me why this affects Bernie Sanders supporters more than Clinton supporters?"
"7831","1461117135","This shouldn't be ""In a win for Bernie Supporters,"" it should be ""In a win for voters' rights."""
"7832","1461102850","Just as a question. How are delegate allocations determined for a state? 

Is it population or registered party voters?
Would a simple solution not be to make delegate allocations for a coming primaries based on the number of eligible voters? That would encourage open primaries and accurate and up to date voter registration at the state level without these damaging and largely difficult to substantiate claims of systemic bias and restricted access. If a state did that, they would simply be worth less and have their ability to determine the election for candidates that suit their needs diminished."
"7833","1461108651","Good deal, though I'm not sure this is great for Bernie supporters - NYC is very much Clinton territory, and the demographics in places like Brooklyn are in Clinton's favor. 

Voter suppression in NYC favors Bernie, since he does much better upstate. 

This is what happens when you nullify voting rights laws.  "
"7834","1461109595","This is what puzzles me. We all have a right to vote if we're citizens in this country, but we have restrictions in place to prevent a small percentage of non-voting people to not vote. Does that small fraction of the population really have the ability to hurt the overall election process? Are we concerned with a small group that we who all have a right to vote get purged ""on accident"" and make it harder to actually exercise that right? 

I would understand if non-voters made up 50.1%+ of the population that this would make sense to put hurdles in place to count actual citizens votes, but this is god damn lunacy people. "

"7836","1461113981","How is this a win for Sanders?  He relies on independent voters, and the ones who were affected here are Democrats.  This will hurt him, not help him."
"7837","1461098477","Poll workers are suppressing them regardless.

People who were purged were turned away from polls and not even allowed to fill out a provisional ballot.

"
"7838","1461114933","Hillary does better with registered Democrats than Sanders does.  We are talking about people who are registered Democrats who lost their registration because they became inactive. Many of them were actually sent notices and had moved without a forwarding address.  This isn't some big conspiracy either. "

"7842","1461119790","something tells me their votes still won't be counted in the end"
"7843","1461113203","This is great, but my polling place still told me that ""there are no provisional ballots in New York "" I wonder if they were just confused, but they claimed the board of elections told them that. I fought them enough to end up voting but I imagine many wouldn't argue for 30 minutes. There's no way this is fair. 
"
"7844","1461115120","Jeez. It's possible that hillary supporters were actually more affected by the purge.  /r/politics, keep up the circle jerk!"

Trump was chosen by Heaven.

To the skies
See the Donald rise.

With the Don my protector.
Make them bow to his will.
To the skies
See the Donald rise.

To the skies.
See the Donald rise.

Proved in battle, led centipedes to victory.
No man alive or dead commands him, I answer to the Trump! 
Hear his orders, question them and die.
What he says was said in Heaven, and so it shall be done! 

I know Trump was destined to rule alone! 
All for his self he will claim the throne, born to rule! 
Trump's time is now.

Trump was chosen by Heaven.
Say his name when you pray.
To the skies.
See the Donald rise.

With the Don my protector.
Make them bow to his will.
To the skies.
See the Donald rise.

To the skies. 
See the Donald rise.

All this might shall be Trump's, there's no stopping him.
All over USA, his rule shall be questioned by none.
All Trump sees, give to hiiim - that is his decree.
Trump's will be done! 

*Solo* 

They thought Trump was too young to rule the land.
Just as they failed to understand how to rule. 
Trump's time is now.

Trump was chosen by Heaven.
Say his name when you pray.
To the skies.
See the Donald rise.

With the Don my protector.
Let them bow to his will.
To the skies.
See the Donald rise.

If the powers that be refuse to listen to voters, we have only two options. We can accept the fact that we no longer have a voice and democracy is dead like cowards, or we can demand to be heard like the founding fathers of this nation intended.

**Predicting the Democratic Primaries:** 
--

An apples-to-apples comparison of the non-caucus elections this year.
--


With 19 primaries in the bag, I feel comfortable doing an apples-to-apples, primary only comparison and ranking.

The scoring system I use is designed to generate an ""accuracy score"":

&gt;* **Constant number** 0.1 (to make the numbers greater than zero, purely aesthetic)
* divide by **absolute error** %
* divide by large **miss greater than 10 points** %
* divide by **range of error** %
* divide by square root of (**3 point accuracy** rate inverse * **5 point accuracy** rate inverse)

For the math-y's in the room, this means that the smaller you can make your inaccuracies, the higher the score.  

We now have our rankings:

#1 - [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) Best Model

* Accuracy Score: **110.3**
* **2.7% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **1.5 points**

While mathematically awesome (Nate predicted that 58% of the polls-plus would be superior, and 42% of the polls only would be superior), **this model cannot stand on its own.** Technically  but not intuitively (and Nate maybe will appreciate this more than most, being a master of uncertainty), he's created the best model of prediction.  Consider his Polls Only **along with** his Polls Plus forecast, and you have the best model, period.  

Unfortunately, you have no way of knowing which model will be better.  So this ""system"" gets my top ranking.  However, it's just a testament to how sturdy Nate's overall modeling is, rather than something you can use for prediction prior to a primary.

#2 - [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) Polls Plus

* Accuracy Score: **57.9**
* **3.1% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **2 points**

While Nate gets the best score above on a technicality, his ""Polls Plus"" model wins outright all on its own.

#3 - [Benchmark Politics](http://www.benchmarkpolitics.com)

* Accuracy Score: **47.0**
* **3.1% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **2.1 points**

While not as well-known as fivethirtyeight, this two-man outfit has designed a district and demographic based system that allows for some granular predictions.  Originally designed to *call states early*, they have put their hand in on predicting outcomes.  They benefit from this primaries-only analysis because their attempts (um, admirable as they were) to predict caucuses would have tanked their score.  Taking that failed experiment out of it, Benchmark ranks very strongly, only losing by an edge to 538.

#4 - [RealClearPolitics](http://realclearpolitics.com) Raw Average

* Accuracy Score: **35.5**
* **3.7% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **1.7 points**

Ranking stronger than I would have expected, just looking at the raw average of recent polling is good enough.  A whopping 63% of the raw polling was within 3 points of the actual result.  If you don't care for fancy math, just take a gander at the RCP average.

#5 - [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) Polls Only

* Accuracy Score: **22.8**
* **3.4% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **3 points**

The raw average of RealClearPolitics outperforms Nate's Polls-Only model.  But remember, it shines 42% of the time, combining with the Polls-Plus model to knock it out of the park.  

#6 - [How Will America Vote](http://howwillamericavote.com)

* Accuracy Score: **13.1**
* **5.0% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **4.4 points**

We're getting into ""not very helpful"" territory here.  I think this a model that may prove itself much more reliable in the general, but there is something about the ways that past and recent results interact to just skew the results.  Following these sites over time, the fluctuations on HWAV are quite wild.  Maybe time will vindicate the model, but it doesn't look hot for the democratic primary.  The only advantage over those who rank under it, is that the 3-point and 5-point call rates are superior by a small amount.

#6 - [Last Poll Posted](http://realclearpolitics.com)

* Accuracy Score: **9.1**
* **4.5% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **3.8 points**

I created this model as a joke.  It is not last place.

#7 - [Tyler Pedigo](http://tylerpedigo.com)
* Accuracy Score: **7.0**
* **4.8% average error**
* 50% of calls are within **3.8 points**

(*For a full disclosure: he recently blocked me from his twitter.  It doesn't stop me from reading his site, or including his scores here, however I'd assume this means that he's not appreciating the place I'm putting him here.*)  

Tyler has been nice to me (prior to the above, which came out of the blue, with no argument or discussion) in conversations.  He has discussed accuracy with me on reddit.  He has insisted this is just a hobby for him. Overall, he is trying something new and bold, using social media activity and other ""enthusiasm"" factors online (google searches, for example) to predict the primaries.  I give him points for that, however those points are not in my formula. 

**This model performs worse than just taking the last poll before the primary**.  Worse, his site is filled with statistical manipulations that are verging on obscene for anyone into statistics, and [his recent post about his accuracy overall](https://tylerpedigo.com/2016/04/06/political-forecasting-an-imprecise-science/) ... well, lets just say that the external analysis of prediction *disagrees*.  To put the horrible spread this model generates into perspective, if Tyler Pedigo calls a state 50-50 for Bernie, it is as likely to be Bernie -15 as it is Hillary -15.

**CONCLUSION**
---

**Nate Silver, and the Benchmark Politics Crew, are using demographics and polling in a way that truly works.**  For this cycle, they have been remarkably accurate.  Michigan's result aside (no really! we need to set it aside for about 100 more primaries to know what it means), this traditional but advanced mathematical way of looking at polling and demographics represents an advancement of polling prediction.  With a number of states to go (Though... Senator Sanders, Mr. Devine... please know that for those of us who understand math... really? how many more states do we have to go?), we'll be able to continue to monitor the progress.

&amp;nbsp;

Many of us use resources like PolitiFact.com to inform our political leanings regarding the various candidates. Obviously these resources are most helpful when they are accurate and unbiased and these resources certainly portray themselves in this light. I like to at least believe that the website is attempting to be fair and unbiased; however, a review of various determinations shows the website to be extremely nit picky regarding various Bernie Sanders statements and very forgiving to several Hillary Clinton statements. What do we know about PolitiFact?
 
PolitiFact is a project of the Tampa Bay Times. Note that the TBT openly endorses Clinton: ""[She] has been battle-tested, and she is better prepared to be president than when she lost to Obama in the 2008 primaries. The fight for the Democratic nomination may last far longer than anticipated, but only Clinton can win in November and is prepared for the nation's highest office. For the Democratic nomination for president, the Tampa Bay Times recommends Hillary Clinton."" [from Editorial: Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination].
 
That the Tampa Bay Times is obviously and admittedly pro-Hillary does not necessarily imply that PolitiFact.com is biased and it is at least reasonable to assume that the platform is maintained with an interest to remain unbiased regardless of the views of those affiliated with the project. With that said, facts speak louder than words. Let's review some PolitiFact outcomes:
 

*****

[Bernie Sanders: We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-repeats-flawed-claim-about-us-healt/) Additional quote: [We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation on Earth.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/20/bernie-s/sanders-says-us-doubles-every-other-country-capita/)
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Rated FALSE x2
&amp;nbsp;

* First note that this double whammy (the same basic quote is scored twice) is costing Bernie Sanders two ""false claims"" for the exact same claim stated earlier and repeated later. Under this type of analysis we may as well double dip on Hillary and Trump EVERY SINGLE TIME they restate anything that was scored false/mostly false. A review of Hillary's page does not find repeated statements piggybacking to tank her false/mostly false record (instead, this type of double dipping favors her, providing extra trues)
&amp;nbsp;

* This is even more asinine when you actually read the quote Bernie was scored on in light of the facts and the PolitiFacts analysis. For example, PolitiFact states in part, ""The United States spends more on health care per capita than other countries, but not always twice as much."" (emphasis added).
&amp;nbsp;

* Sanders should be evaluated on what he ACTUALLY SAID, which is that we spend almost twice as much per capita. Any REASONABLE person can see the below data and decide for themselves that **this statement is AT BEST partially true and is certainly NOT FALSE**.

[Bernie Sanders: ""I helped write"" the Affordable Care Act.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/18/bernie-s/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-he-helped-write/)
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Rated MOSTLY FALSE
&amp;nbsp;

* While he originally supported his own version he wrote a provision worth 11 billion to this bill. how does this not quality as ""helped write""?
&amp;nbsp;

* He did not claim to have written the entire act; at best Politifact seems to base their rating on a supposed inference Bernie made to making a greater contribution than he actually made (rather than rate his actual quote &amp; and judging for themselves whether they consider adding an 11 billion dollar provision to the bill counts as ""helping"").

[Bernie Sanders: federal government, not McDonald's or Walmart, is biggest low-wage employer](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-federal-government-not-mcdonal/)
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Rated MOSTLY FALSE
&amp;nbsp;

* The quote in its entirety: ""There is no justice in America when the largest low-wage employer is not McDonalds; it is not Burger King; it is not Walmart; it is the United States government,""
&amp;nbsp;

* Based on PolitiFact's own findings: Federal Govt employs nearly 2 million low wage earners. McDonald's: 580,485; Walmart: 901,600.
&amp;nbsp;

* **Note that the statement is patently true**; however, PolitiFact then goes out of its way to (1) make a comparison of the total federal government low wage jobs vs the TOTAL COMBINED jobs provided by McDonald's and Walmart and (2) move the ball to point out the the federal government is likely the ""largest vendor of just about every kind of worker -- high, medium, and low-wage workers"" and then uses the above as the basis for providing the rating.
&amp;nbsp;

* PolitiFact goes on to mention that the federal government pays low wage earnings more than the private sector (you would think this is a point in Bernie's favor...)
&amp;nbsp;

* PolitiFact uses statistics of questionable value for analyzing the quote for truth: ""90 percent of workers across all levels of government make more than $12 per hour in half of the 50 states"".
 
&amp;nbsp;

Now let's discuss Double Dipping aka let's rate several equivalent Bernie statements false while we rate several different equivalent Hillary statements true:

&amp;nbsp;

Bernie Sanders: ""Never said ... a newspaper endorsed us that did not."" &amp; ""Says he was endorsed by the Valley News newspaper""

&gt; Each is rated FALSE
&amp;nbsp;

* This quote is not actually a quote from him at all and instead is taken from a political ad spoken by a narrator on his behalf (that is to say, at best, he ""endorsed"" the message). If we are going to expand Politifact ratings to include all statements made on behalf of various candidates in all of these political adverts I suggest we include everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Rated MOSTLY TRUE
&amp;nbsp;

* First of all this is a sweeping statement that, under the Bernie level scrutiny, would certainly be rated FALSE. However, PolitiFacts notes that ""In January, 2000, the average worker earned $334 a week. By January, 2015, that figure was $341  a 2 percent increase.""
&amp;nbsp;

* PolitiFacts instead decides to rate her statement against the fact that the Inflation-adjusted median household income has decreased while earnings have increased a ""modest 2%"".

[Hillary Clinton: ""He voted for what we call the Charleston loophole. \(referring to Bernie Sanders\)](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-hillary-clintons-claim-bernie-sander/)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Rated MOSTLY TRUE
&amp;nbsp;

* In NO terms did he ""vote for"" any gun loophole or Charleston loophole and for this statement to be rated Mostly True is mind-boggling.
&amp;nbsp;

* At best Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady bill five times... also note that in November 1993, Sanders voted for an amendment imposing an instant background check, as noted by PolitiFact.
&amp;nbsp;

* **PolitiFact equates a vote against the Brady bill as equivalent to a vote for the Charleston loophole - a GROSS misrepresentation**.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Rated MOSTLY TRUE
&amp;nbsp;

* Sure would appreciate some of that Sanders level nit picky scrutiny here... **the fact is that her statement is only sorta true for specific periods within the 1960s with several caveats** as is admitted by Politifact.
&amp;nbsp;

* PolitiFact rates the statement MOSTLY TRUE in spite of finding: (1) ""Its true that segregation for blacks is worse today than it was in 1968, but its certainly not worse than 1964 and before""; (2) fewer black students attend [overwhelmingly black] schools now than they did in 1968 (four in 10 versus six in 10), signalling a decline in segregation; (3) a study found ""segregation has been declining since the 1970s, albeit at a slower rate in the past decade.""; and (4) Overall, experts say and the data shows that the United States has taken two steps forward and one step back, but hasnt quite reverted to pre-Civil Rights levels of segregation.

"
"8195","1461088854","Wow.  I read through the first point and then stopped at how little it factually covered Glass-Steagall and the Subprime Mortgage crisis.

Here's some more things that contributed to the Subprime mortgage crisis.  Hint:  They are because of regulatory government actions in the economy, NOT because of deregulation.

When the Government enacted the Freddie and Fannie Enterprises. The GSEs forced banks to take higher risk loans that they otherwise would have never given.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis#Role_of_Fannie_Mae_and_Freddie_Mac

That combined with using the Federal Reserve, the Government forced artificially lower interest rates that made people borrow from Subprime loans that normally would never have been able to.

&gt; In a free market, lending large amounts of money to low-income, low-credit borrowers with no down payment would quickly prove disastrous. But the Federal Reserve Boards inflationary policy of artificially low interest rates made investing in subprime loans extraordinarily profitable. Subprime borrowers who would normally not be able to pay off their expensive houses could do so, thanks to payments that plummeted along with Fed rates. And the inflationary housing boom meant homeowners rarely defaulted; so long as housing prices went up, even the worst-credit borrowers could always sell or refinance.

I say this as someone still bitter about the fact that they gave ""lie of the year"" to ""Republicans want to end Medicare as we know it"" when the Ryan budget they pushed through the House that year did exactly that, and Politifact's complaint was that Democrats exaggerated who it would affect in campaign ads. Basically every other nominee they had that year was more clear-cut, but hey, they'd picked Republican lies for the previous several years. That was when I and many others decided they were themselves still too caught up with maintaining the appearance of being even-handed for a world with gross party asymmetry on truth-telling.

Serious critiques of Politifact are not what's going on here on Reddit though.

"8252","1461127287","Here's what isn't being discussed:

**While Clinton and Sanders are relatively close in pledged delegates, superdelegates support Hillary overwhelmingly.**

Though the effect is difficult to measure, this has helped Clinton in the primaries because most media outlets have reported total delegates only. This misleads uninformed viewers into thinking that the gap in the electoral race is wider than it really is.

Right now superdelegates do not reflect the will of the voters because they disproportionately back Clinton. **If Bernie were to flip superdelegates to his side, this would only serve to bring them closer to the will of the voters. This is absolutely the right thing to do strategically and ethically.**

If all the superdelegates go for Sanders while Clinton is winning the popular vote then we can have a discussion about hypocrisy."

The Democratic National Convention comes after the RNC. If polling shows Bernie is a significantly stronger candidate than Hillary against the Republican nominee, as a Democrat I want the superdelegates to do what's right for the party. This is also the logical fallback plan if Hillary becomes too damaged a candidate to continue due to some scandal or other gaining traction. 

I want Bernie to stick around because Hillary isn't a very strong candidate. It could also give him some leverage to build a movement going forward. His message needs to stay part of this campaign."

There's also a lawsuit going before a Federal judge today, which may open the primary.

EJU filed for an emergency injunctive action for declaratory judgement to open the New York Primary for thousands of voters purged and for voters who had registrations changed without consent.

    For a voter who believes she or he is a registered Democrat or Republican and does not appear in the poll books, Ryan said there is another option.

    If for some reason there's a processing error and the person's name does not appear on the book, they can vote by affidavit ballot at the poll site, said Ryan.

    Affidavit, or provisional, ballots are paper and are not put through the scanner. But it still gives a person the ability to vote and those votes are counted.

    If a voter experiences a problem at their poll site, State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office has set up a hotline that will be staffed by attorneys in the office's Civil Rights Bureau. That number is 800-771-7755. Complaints can also be submitted through email at civil.rights@ag.ny.gov at any time between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Tuesday.

Because I believe a legitimate argument exists that independent *should* be able to vote. And they should petition the process to change to include independents.

So if you want to engage in some protest of civil disobedience, go ahead and do it. Just be aware you're breaking the law by signing that affidavit. And if you were purged from the Democratic registration list, sign that affidavit with confidence! It's for specifically for your use. 

One of the lessons this primary season is know your state's rules. A lot of them are finicky and institutionally a device of suppression. But a lot of them like closed primaries are legal even if they are arguably a means to suppress independents.

"8417","1461105689","I think there is the potential - but absolutely not a guarantee - that Sanders could siphon off some GOP voters. But I wouldn't describe these voters as orthodox conservatives. Instead the voters I think about are those that tend to identify with the GOP and might even identify as conservative, but tend to support a broad range of progressive - as well as traditionally conservative -  policy positions when asked. 

There is even a name for this group, a guy named Donald Warren called them them ""Middle American Radicals""  (MARs) in a book called ""The Radical Center: Middle Americans and the Politics of Alienation.""

&gt;These voters were not college educated; their income fell somewhere in the middle or lower-middle range; and they primarily held skilled and semi-skilled blue-collar jobs or sales and clerical white-collar jobs. At the time, they made up about a quarter of the electorate. What distinguished them was their ideology: It was neither conventionally liberal nor conventionally conservative, but instead revolved around an intense conviction that the middle class was under siege from above and below.

These are the voters that the GOP has ridden like rented mules over the past 40 years, promising much to secure their support but advancing a libertarian agenda that isn't really in their interests. They are alienated from the establishment and they are ready to be alienated from the GOP.

I think alot of these voters are Trump supporters - attracted especially by his nativist emotional appeal - but could become Sanders supporters if the GOP doesn't nominate Trump, or his act becomes threadbare with repeated viewings, or he implodes in some other way, or if Sanders tailors his message to go after them more effectively."

The main points are:

Pollworkers are required to show you a ""notice to voters."" This document tells you that you have two options: affidavit ballot or court order. IT IS MY OPINION THAT YOU SEEK A COURT ORDER. Is this going to be extra work? Yes. If you're unsure about your voter status, give yourself plenty of time to vote [...]

If you seek a court order, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET WITH THE LOCAL STATE SUPREME COURT JUDGE ON CALL, and the Board of Elections. MANY OF THESE JUDGES ARE VERY LIBERAL IN THEIR RULINGS, often side with the voter. You will then be issued a document that you can bring to the polling place that allows you to cast your ballot INTO THE MACHINE.

If you choose the option to vote by affidavit ballot, you will be directed to a station within the polling place dedicated to this process. You will then be required to fill out what is essentially a registration form. TAKE YOUR TIME FILLING THIS OUT. It will be scrutinized by Election commissioners of both parties after the election. Your registration and party enrollment will be checked, and voted on by each commissioner to determine if the envelope should be opened and ballot counted.

AVOID voting by AFFIDAVIT BALLOT, unless you have no other option. Chances are good that affidavit ballots will not be counted. "

As well as the affadavit ballot, there are court orders available: http://i.imgur.com/nqA5aie.png  Neither should be used by people who know they didn't register/switch affiliation in time. These options are for people who believe the registration/affiliation has been altered without their consent. For the court order vs. affidavit I think people should call the hotline if they are refused but it comes down to a timing thing really.  If they can get the court order, that's better since they KNOW their vote will be counted since its on the machines.  If they cant do that, then at least vote provisional/affidavit so there is a chance it could be used. So, court order if possible, affadavit otherwise.

If you absolutely can not make a vote the standard way, DEMAND court or affidavit ballot."

Motivational speakers, journalists and celebrities are just some examples.  One of the big reasons that they pay so much for these luminaries is to give their employees the impression that they work for a large dynamic organization, i.e a retention tool and morale builder for their own people.  So, while this is clearly an example of Hillary cashing in on the speaker circuit in a way that she clearly should have avoided given her presidential ambitions, to treat it as if it was some mysterious political corruption scheme rather than the standard, banal  corporate event circuit is off base.

There's an unstated assumption  that it is somehow wrong for Clinton to make more in a speech than he makes in a year. The argument is unstated, and left for the reader to infer, without the author having to actually back up the argument.

Another example:

&gt; Stephanopoulos Again Fails to Disclose His Donations During Clinton Interview

There is an unstated assumption there that he did something wrong - that he should have disclosed donations. It is left unstated, in an attempt to let the reader create the conclusion for themselves.

What is that technique called?

For example, if i said:

&gt; Bernie Sanders has yet to disclose the religion of his grandchildren.

By phrasing it that way, the reader is being pushed to draw the conclusion that the author intends. When in reality, it is just a statement of fact.

What is the term for the technique of pushing the reader to draw the intended conclusion, but without having to directly state it, or even argue it:

&gt; - Fox News discovers Reddit is hosted on Amazon cloud servers

But in finally unsealing some of these materials last week, a federal judge named Margaret Sweeney said the government's sole motivation was avoiding embarrassment.

&gt;""Instead of harm to the Nation resulting from disclosure, the only 'harm' presented is the potential for criticism,"" Sweeney wrote.

The ACA needs to be different, I guess I could've tried for Medicaid, I don't think I would've qualified and besides that is not how I was brought up.

"8637","1461080397","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus

&gt; Muhammad Yunus (Bengali:  ; born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, economist and civil society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ""for their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below"". The Norwegian Nobel Committee noted that ""lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty"" and that ""across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development"". Yunus has received several other national and international honours. He received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.

http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/yunus-facts.html

&gt; Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 for their work to ""create economic and social development from below"". Grameen Bank's objective since its establishment in 1983 has been to grant poor people small loans on easy terms - so-called micro-credit - and Yunus was the bank's founder.

&gt; In 1972, following studies in Bangladesh and the USA, Yunus was appointed professor of economics at the University of Chittagong. When Bangladesh suffered a famine in 1974, he felt that he had to do something more for the poor beyond simply teaching. He decided to give long-term loans to people who wanted to start their own small enterprises. This initiative was extended on a larger scale through Grameen Bank.

&gt; According to Yunus, poverty means being deprived of all human value. He regards micro-credit both as a human right and as an effective means of emerging from poverty: Lend the poor money in amounts which suit them, teach them a few basic financial principles, and they generally manage on their own, Yunus claims.

By whom?

Brooklyn is [32% black and 22% Jewish](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Demographics_of_Brooklyn), and Clinton is favored among each of those groups.

Brooklyn is blacker than the state of Louisiana by %.

There are 4x as many black people in Brooklyn as there are in Louisiana.

Suppressing 160K votes in Brooklyn helps Sanders.

Hell suppressing *every vote* in Brooklyn would radically help Sanders.

"8704","1461097686","Of course they are."
"8705","1461124525","This place is predictable; right after the debate I said the delusion would make them scream corruption.  Yelling and booing in a room full of people does not win a primary. Connecting to voting constituents does. 

Do people not understand how much new yorkers hate people trying to tell us who we are? Sanders assumes to much and SOME I do mean only SOME of his supporters, mainly online entities believe their thinly veiled racism is some how selling points on their candidate. Most people in New York were never going to vote for a dude they have only seen in a month, I don't care what borough he was born in. 

The fact that it was his selling point is absurd, guns actually matter to us. I know reddit may not like that, but we legit don't care how those states feel about our laws. Just like other states don't care how New York feels about their laws. Just cause you see the place in media doesn't mean you know the people, or our problems. Yet that condescending attitude from Sanders and some of his supporters just smugly kept coming in. Rick Lazio was actually from New York also, he didn't win. 

You can be on reddit and the net all you want. You can spout racism for 4-8 years all you want but there comes a time where actions meet consequence. Today is that day, in the so called liberal bastion he was shot down. Understand nobody is going to back somebody that never supported them before beyond getting arrested 30 years ago. Many sure as hell aren't going to support his fans after the myriad of racism that has been seen the past years.  So I legit don't know where this campaign goes from here, but in another 4 years this will happen again, make connections today. 

It really didn't have to be this way I saw a world where Sanders won, but at the end of the day sides were chosen. You can't start a revolution by stepping on the people at the bottom. I am sorry college students you aren't the poorest or the most disadvantaged in the country, no matter how much some want to believe that. One group dominates higher education more than any other, I am ok with it if the majority is also. But when you are ok with this, don't ask for support from the ones left behind; that is just delusional. Do what works for you and people will do what works for them. "
