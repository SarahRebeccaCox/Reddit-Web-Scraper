"263","1460773810","Well, I don't want to question the clearly keen legal scholarship of Ms. Dawson, but what exactly about *Citizens United* is it that she wants overturned?

First amendment protections for corporations?  That was established long before *Citizens United*, and is the whole reason the New York Times is able to do really any of the things it does.  Nor is there any basis in the first amendment for extending press rights to corporations but not free speech.

Money as speech?  Okay, but that opens up a *lot* of side-door maneuvers to suppress both freedom of speech and of press.  If money spent to create or disseminate speech is not protected as speech, criticism of the government which requires any resources beyond ""going door to door"" could be limited.

Corporations aren't people?  Completely irrelevant and (as even Lawrence Lessig accepts) did not factor into the decision.

Sincerely,

Your source is 5 or 6 years old. Wealth has continued to consolidate quite a bit since this paper.

 However think about it this way. Out of all the wealth the 8%  from your source holds, what percentage of that is controlled by the 60 wealthiest people on the planet? Most of it. Somebody who has 1 million dollars is in the 8%, along with people with 50 billion dollars. The top 60 are all billionaires. 

In 2015 the 60th wealthiest person was worth 15.7 billion and the wealthiest was worth 79.2 billion.

"300","1460773311","""I see that hope and sense of possibility every day among America’s young people. Our youth are no longer satisfied with corrupt and broken politics and an economy of stark inequality and injustice. They are not satisfied with the destruction of our environment by a fossil fuel industry whose greed has put short term profits ahead of climate change and the future of our planet. They want to live in harmony with nature, not destroy it. They are calling out for a return to fairness; for an economy that defends the common good by ensuring that every person, rich or poor, has access to quality health care, nutrition and education.


As Pope Francis made powerfully clear last year in Laudato Si’, we have the technology and know-how to solve our problems – from poverty to climate change to health care to protection of biodiversity. We also have the vast wealth to do so, especially if the rich pay their way in fair taxes rather than hiding their funds in the world’s tax and secrecy havens- as the Panama Papers have shown.


The challenges facing our planet are not mainly technological or even financial, because as a world we are rich enough to increase our investments in skills, infrastructure, and technological know-how to meet our needs and to protect the planet. Our challenge is mostly a moral one, to redirect our efforts and vision to the common good. Centesimus Annus, which we celebrate and reflect on today, and Laudato Si’, are powerful, eloquent and hopeful messages of this possibility. It is up to us to learn from them, and to move boldly toward the common good in our time."""

Say what you will about Bernie but he is giving her a run for her money and really making her look bad in the primaries. He's a tough opponent to attack without making her look conservative.

It would reveal that the massive campaign and super-PAC contributions Clinton has received from Wall Street did indeed, as Sanders has alleged, influence her ability to get tough on Wall Street malfeasance either in Congress or behind closed doors.

If it wasn't for unions fighting the ""job creators"" we would be working seven days a week from the age of ten until we died. There is something wrong with that. The fact that wages were allowed to stay so low, all while corporate profits and equity markets soared prove there is a problem. If the lowest paid workers among us get paid wages that are below poverty levels. Then every single one us will be paid less. Maybe the price of goods and services would rise with an increase in the minimum wage, but I guarantee that those price increases don't outpace the rise in wages.

As you praise capitalism, I encourage you to also take a step back. Look at the larger picture and in a more a abstract sense, try and dissect what capitalism is and why it's been successful. It's not that capitalism is some magic wand, it's a system that has underlying mechanisms which have brought us this growth. Ask yourself what those mechanisms are, and how we can strengthen those mechanisms. At the same time, look at the problems it has been unable to solve, and how we can fix that. Because while we've seen great growth, you can't deny the crummy materialistic consumer culture it promotes through constant manipulative advertisements to sell us products we don't actually need, and the amount of environmental damage we've caused for the sake of cost savings and convenience.

To me, what I believe has made capitalism successful is that it distributed power. It gave people much more control over their lives and their communities, where previously the decision making had come from the top down and people had mostly pre defined roles. It was too rigid. The people making the decisions were too far removed to even know what was going on or how their decisions affected the people, and obviously those making the decisions have their own interests held above others. Capitalism smashed this idea at first, but it hasn't solved it. Time and time again, our economic power gets concentrated again in the hands of the few, and the engine stalls."

"556","1460739412","If you understand Spanish, please watch this interview from the now assassinated Berta Caceres (16 minutes):


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7vrgwbS074


It is crushing to hear the world-known activist listing all the oppression in Honduras, how the illegal coup was carried out to benefit the oligarchs, how Hillary Clinton was the main thrust behind legitimizing the military coup, how her friends are getting assassinated for standing up to the foreign special interests that toppled Zelaya's government, the list of issues/demands the poor in Honduras are dying for...

... but most crushingly... she predicted her death and was fearful then for her life (before getting assassinated by the coup heirs to power in Honduras). She did not care... she was going to continue to fight on for justice and for the people of Honduras who don't have Hillary an email away to shill for their interests (unlike the oligarchs)."
"557","1460750718","Just in case anyone's interested in a more nuanced take, including arguments for why the coup was actually a legal transfer of power (though maybe carried out illegally) and the surprising fact that people on the right criticized Hillary at the time for *opposing* the new government, here's some stuff I pulled together in a discussion on another forum:

First, criticism from the [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204518504574423570828980800) for not supporting the coup/transfer of power:
&gt;Ever since Manuel Zelaya was removed from the Honduran presidency by that country's Supreme Court and Congress on June 28 for violations of the constitution, the Obama administration has insisted, without any legal basis, that the incident amounts to a ""coup d'état"" and must be reversed....""The administration is standing by its ""coup"" charge and 10 days ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went so far as to sanction the country's independent judiciary. The U.S. won't say why, but its clear the court's sin is rejecting a U.S.-backed proposal to restore Mr. Zelaya to power....""Since June 28, the U.S. has been pressuring Honduras to put Mr. Zelaya back in the presidency. But neither Mrs. Clinton's spurious ""rule of law"" claims or the tire iron handed her by Mr. Obama to use against this little country have been effective in convincing the Honduran judiciary that it ought to abandon its constitution.""

Then, apparently the idea that the removal of Zelaya from office (though not his exile from the country, and perhaps not the way it was done) was legal and constitutional has a lot of support. (So does the idea that it wasn't, of course.) Here are some examinations of it, pro and con: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27état#Legality_of_ouster), [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2009/0721/p09s02-wogn.html), [CNN](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-295913).

That last is by Miguel Estrada, whom some of you may remember as a George Bush nominee to the US Court of Appeals who was rejected for being a conservative ideologue. So take it with however much salt you need. He is Honduran himself, though, and that article offers the most detailed account of Zelaya's actions that allegedly led to his ouster."
"558","1460734295","Clinton is a war hawk with the blood of thousands on her hands already. Electing her president will just continue this pattern of spreading death and destruction around the globe. More money for military contractors and war profiteers, none for infrastructure, renewable energy, universal single payer healthcare, and education.

We have to break this cycle and with the president controlling the executive branch, not electing Clinton is the most effective way to do this. Sanders would crush in the general election and his willingness to say no to more irration action like what happened in Honduras can make more of a difference than most are willing to acknowledge."
"559","1460744738","Not quite, here's a less biased view from the Washington Post:
""Instead of condemning the figures behind the uprising, suspending support to the illegitimate government of Zelaya’s successor, Roberto Micheletti, and demanding a restoration of the democratically elected Zelaya, Secretary Clinton decided to move on. In her memoir “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that after the coup, she went about hatching a plan with other leaders in the region “to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.” The United States pushed for elections, and in November 2009, despite a boycott by opposition leaders and international observers, elections were orchestrated by the same figures behind Zelaya’s ouster.""

So is it fair to ask questions of why she didn't do more?  Sure.  Is it correct to say there was a coup we supported?  Only in the fevered imaginings of Bernie and Trump supporters.

Only dropping cannabis to Schedule 2 is the liberal version of conservatives making *some* leeway for racial equality. I use that example because normally a liberal desires *complete equality* and the only way to gain parity for the cannabis issue is to remove cannabis as a Scheduled drug **at all**.

Campaign contribution corrupt politicians
Overthrowing regimes in ME and Latin America has lead to mass instability in these regions

Gone against free trade policies
Talking about the consequences and mistakes of the Iraq war
Talking about mass incarceration and criminal justice reform

Personally, I'm not as liberal as Sander's but I appreciate that he is bringing topics in to the political dialogue that wouldn't be out there otherwise. This is one of the first few primaries where it feels like there is an actual debate and differences between the two candidates which are very substantive. There's no chance that we would be having the same political conversations about things like income inequality unless Sander's was in this race. For that reason Sander's has already succeeded in expanding the Overton window. The question is if people in the party will let that window shut and we'll be stuck with solely establishment politicians next primary or if more true progressives follow Sander's lead and continue to expand that window. I highly doubt that a candidate like Clinton will be elected again, but who knows

This is how you know someone is bought and paid for when they make excuses about something that is clearly immoral to every one else. It is like a bad relationship. Your friends can see it, your family can see it, only you cannot see that your significant other is abusive, cheating, etc because you so desperately want to hang onto that hope that things can get better. I know Hillary supporters will see this is unfair but they are acting exactly like that hurt teen that only believes their family is just trying to separate them from their happiness, when in reality the family has seen the partner do something that is clearly immoral. The only way those supporting Hillary so passionately continue to do so is because they are just like that Hurt teen. They have resorted to calling Bernie supporters all sorts of names because we refuse to vote for Hillary. But we, like the family members, see Hillary for what she is and thus refuse to vote for her because we know she is immoral. 

The fact is simple. Taking money from anyone who is a conflict of interest is nothing short of Bribery. it is a means that has been employed by all sorts of organized crime, dirty politics and dirty business since the beginning of time and there is no difference here other than our politicians decided it should be legal. Making it legal, however, does not make it moral and the fact remains that taking money from a conflict of interest only openly invites that particular party to influence policy. It is how we have gotten into the current economic and environmental messes we are currently in. Because lobbyists for these industries have hit the pavement daily pounding on the doors of our congressmen/women with huge financial backings. The ration between lobbyists supporting corporate interest lobby's vs Lobbyists for the people is around 1000:1. So you cannot say that the money they provide doesn't influence the politicians. All the evidence you need to see that it has indeed influenced them is just by looking at the wealth distribution over the last 30 years. 

So to claim that there is no issue with Clinton taking that money in the forms of speeches, money to her superpacs, money to her foundation is completely false and a clear indicator that her supporters are indeed the emotional drama teens that clearly cannot see reality. "

Sorry but when you are a president you are supposed to be the leader and others should follow you and not the other way around. This is something I miss in Hillary. She hardly ever takes the initiative and just goes with the flow (also applicable on her stands towards most important progressive topics). 

Another trait of a good leader is taking the blame when it is yours to take and not blame somebody else for the mistakes you made! Yesterday in debate you could clearly see she that she doesn't understand this (she solely blamed Obama for some mistakes she was as much responsible for.

Great movements in America have always required being human before being a politician. Hillary is getting huge sums of money for being a Clinton.  She says she represents the people,  but she isn't talking about her ideas. She criticizes Bernie's ideas, and tries to find loopholes. When I watch her, it almost seems like she is arguing in court trying to use long articulated sentences while replying to simple questions.   She acts like what's done is done, and that these changes Bernie speaks of shouldn't be attempted.  In the 1700s, England was in its prime, and mighty.  The colonists were at their mercy, yet they stood up, and fought for what they believed in despite the situation being ""imlossible."" When Lincoln dropped the emancipation proclamation on the world, much of the United States didn't support this, he was even assassinated.  Here we are now.

It's simply not possible for a person to have always held a simple position on a complex issue such as the second amendment, social security, abortion. There's also a sense that her eyes and the words coming out of her mouth don't sync, as though she's just going through the motions because she has to but she's quietly simmering inside, ""I can't believe I have to debate this unqualified fool"", the same simmering we saw in 2008, the ""I can't believe I might lose to this amateur.""

"876","1460739546","I like how the main issue anyone has with Bernie is that he doesn't have a fully laid out plan on how to handle certain situations.

Breaking up the banks?  Well, we can't even begin to address that until we know how the banks are connected.  We know there are some loop holes they are using to circumvent illegal acts, but until he has all the information, he won't be able to make a plan that works.  And he can't get the information he needs until he's in office.

It's not that it's an unrealistic plan, like Trump's wall and having Mexico pay for it.  It's that even if he said, the first step is to re-enact Glass Steagall, there might be new loop holes introduced after the fact thanks to Frank-Dodd.  So everything has to be taken into consideration, or else he'll say something he can't back up and therefore be considered a liar or a flip flopper, etc.

The difference between him and Clinton is he wants to break up big banks, while Clinton accepts money from them.

Then comes issues in the Middle East?  I'm sorry, but I'm sure he's not privileged in his current position on all the operations and things going on in the Middle East, so simply saying ""we need to stop"" isn't enough.  And coming up with a plan without all the facts is something inexperienced, ignorant people do.

So, from what I see here, the only issue anyone can find with Bernie is that he doesn't like making false promises with plans that are made without all the information?  That's the hallmark of a critical thinker, and I think that's actually a pretty great quality to have in a President.

Why is it seen as a negative that Bernie Sanders couldn't specify differences between his and Trump's stance on NATO? If anything, to me, it shows that this is one issue that both parties can agree to cooperate and actually do something about since their beliefs are similar on this topic.

I personally don't think that because Bernie Sanders agrees with one side of the republican policies, that democrats should see that as a negative. To me, thats a positive.

the fact that bernie couldn't point out a single difference between his stance on nato and trump's stance on nato isn't likely to win him any points among democratic voters either.

she called bernie out on how much his healthcare and college proposals will cost, and reminded everyone that his college plan leaves states on the hook for 1/3 of the cost (a fact that routinely gets glossed over). when bernie tried to defend his plans by saying ""some economists agree with him"", hillary pointed out that most economists don't.

hillary could have been even more aggressive in attacking his college plan by pointing out that the countries offering free college have lower percentages of their population attending/completing college than america currently has, but the moderators were calling time.

i missed the first half hour of the debate (got home right when hillary was reminding everyone how terrible she is on gun policy, and bernie chimed in that he can be terrible too even if he's from a gun friendly state), but the last 90 minutes was completely lopsided against bernie."

&gt;It's that in the history of political rhetoric, no one has ever been inspired by a pragmatist...What Sanders has going for him is that Democrats want to believe in his vision. And when people are asked to choose between their dreams and hard realities, they tend to pick their dreams.

I'm a fairly realistic person so to pragmatism of Hillary really speaks to me.

- Bernie's best moment was really just when Hillary couldn't come up with an answer about her transcripts.

- As a Hillary supporter, I think her response to the transcripts question was awful. Just awful. Lowest point in the debate for either side.

- Hillary trounced him on basically every issue when it came to specific, in-depth policy

- Bernie's inability to come up with even a single time Hillary was influenced by her campaign donations made him look really stupid

- Bernie flat-out misrepresented Hillary's position on the minimum wage, and made it seem like the nationwide $15 minimum wage is the objectively better option, when it's not.

- The crowd was awful. Debates aren't sporting events. These people should shut up regardless of who they're there to support.

- What the hell is with Bernie's taxes? There is tons and tons of precedent for candidates releasing all of their taxes. Why is he being so shady about it? His excuses are lame and shouldn't be accepted"

"938","1460751991","﻿ I have disagreed with Paul Krugman's blogs about Bernie Sanders--his faulty analysis of the Daily News interview, and his sneering depiction of Sanders at every turn as in ""the revolutionary isn't cute any more."" His inability to say anything positive about the man, such as his passion, vision, his consistency, his strength in Congress sponsoring and co-sponsoring bills (across the aisle and with Sec. Clinton), his resonance with many, many voters, any of his policies. This indicates to me not reasoned, authentic political thinking, but a smear campaign. But today Paul Krugman and I agree on something. I found it deeply disturbing that in the Brooklyn debate last night that Sanders reiterated his remark that he lost the South because it's conservative. He lost among African American voters. His remark effectively dismisses them as conservatives, and that's a problem. I don't think the remark accurately reflects his positions and actions concerning systemic racism in this country. But he should hear the problem in his remark and stop saying it, and say why he was wrong to say it. I have been pondering why many African Americans in the Southern primaries (including in my small Virginian town) voted for Clinton. Of course, there are multiple reasons and points of view. But I don't think it has been conservativism. And I don't think it's necessarily affection for the Clintons. People I know said, ""She's electable."" I think African American voters deeply understand the gravity of the situation, more than most white voters probably. A white friend in a predominantly Black union in Philadelphia said that when she asked the question, people said, ""Bernie who?"" The longer the campaign goes on, the more people will be able to answer that question. But Bernie Sanders needs to understand what's wrong with calling a predominantly African American vote (in my town almost all Democrats are Black and almost all Republicans are white) ""conservative."" And he needs to fix it, publicly."

It's so hard to tell what's really going on at a geopolitical level, but Hillary's legitimization of the new Honduran regime just seems super suspect to me.

Many other countries refused to recognize the post-coup government and refused, in protest, to observe the quick fix ""free election"" Hillary negotiated.  

Our allies wanted nothing to do with the election, because it was a sham - 

&gt;While observers were touched by the commitment, courage and enthusiasm of the many Hondurans who participated in this process in good faith, they were also saddened by the numerous discrepancies, lack of preparedness and resources, bribery, voter intimidation, violence and fraud that they witnessed. According to Dale Sorenson of the Task Force on the Americas, the observations documented in the delegation report “demonstrate a clear pattern of systematic undermining of the Honduran people’s right to a free and fair election.”  http://afgj.org/honduras-election-monitoring-report

EDIT:  Now I think about it, there are only 2 possibilities

1) HC had some conflict of interest to support the coup leaders. I can't begin to guess what but I guess Obama did too, since ultimately it was his call.  

2) HC was naive enough to think the leaders of a coup would be sure to run a free and fair election.  Or, let's say it wasn't a coup, she was naive enough to think the kind of people who would issue a secret warrant, arrest the elected President in the middle of the night in his pajamas and extradite him in violation of their own constitution would be sure to run a free and fair elections.

"955","1460770154","This is a repost about the US involvement in regime change in Honduras -   
  
&gt;Dude, it's Honduras. They have by far the highest homicide rate out of any country in the world. More than half as many people are murdered there per year than in the United States, even though their population is only 8.5 million. Their GDP per capita is about $2400 per year, making them one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere.  
  

&gt;Honduras wasn't going to turn into a utopia if the US government cut off much needed aid, which was not required by law, because it was not a military coup, and normal constitutional and electoral function resumed very quickly afterwards. The supreme court was legally entitled to order the president out of office.
  
  
&gt;The real goal in a situation like that is to avoid a civil war, which was a very real possibility. And if the US had taken a strong stance against the new government, and war broke out, they would have been obligated to intervene. That point cannot be stressed enough.
  
  
&gt;To drive that point home, I will give you an example of how you can really fuck that kind of thing up.
  
  
&gt;At the end of the Gulf War in 1991, anybody that had anything to do with the military or foreign relations in the US government was badly in need of a vacation. Thousands people who normally work 40 hours a week had been working 70 hours a week for six months, and more than half a million US military personnel had been in full war mode for even longer.
  
  
&gt;Time to take a breather, right?
  
  
&gt;Wrong. Really wrong.
  
  
&gt;At that exact point in history, the USSR was collapsing. So no time off for anyone.
And in that context, the US made some rather subtle mistakes in their messaging, which is understandable. Unfortunately, as a result, the Iraqi Kurds got the impression that the US would support them of they rose up against Saddam.   
  
  
&gt;But the coalition had avoided invading Iraq precisely because they had achieved their objectives, and didn't want to get caught up in Iraq's ethnic squabbles.
  
  
&gt;The Kurdish uprising was subsequently brutally crushed.
  
  
&gt;It was a lesson for future US administrations. If you give even tacit support for a resistance movement, they might expect you to help them.
  
  
&gt;So when Honduras happened, they kept their mouths shut, and maintained the status quo.
Since you are clearly passionate about this (which I appreciate) I would ask you what you would have done if you were the president of the US when that happened.
  
  
&gt;Keep in mind that at that exact moment, the following things were demanding attention and resources from the Whitehouse:
  
  
&gt;-There were 135,000 troops in Iraq. There were also 50,000 in Afghanistan, where the violence was spiralling out of control.
  
  
&gt;-The global financial crisis was still a huge issue, and the US economy was struggling badly. People were abandoning their homes in large numbers, and tent cities were becoming a common sight in major cities.
    
  
&gt;-The ACA battle, which was to be Obama's signature legislative achievement as President, was in a critical stage.
  
  
&gt;-The Tea Party movement had picked up real steam. People were bringing assault rifles to protests, and talking openly about overthrowing the government by force.
  
  
&gt;-The new H1N1 virus was spreading rapidly in the US. By the end of the year, it would kill more than 3,000 Americans, and put more than 25,000 in hospital, making it more substantial in terms of human damage than either Pearl Harbour or September 11th. "

&gt; The smart cookies, and the authorities on polling data also won’t explain why Bernie Sanders beats both Trump and Cruz by wider margins than Hillary Clinton.

I'm fairly certain it's been explained repeatedly. Bernie doesn't have the electoral history of Hillary and isn't as extensively well known as Hillary. Once he is subjected to attacks from the right, this will change. It's similar to Kasich. 

&gt; ""Bernie Sanders is also ahead of Clinton in the Ipsos/Reuters national poll, 49-28 percent."" 

This is clearly a typo; it's 49-48. 

&gt; ""I explained last year that polling trajectory would lead to Bernie Sanders surpassing Clinton in national polls.""

You said he'd win the nomination - not simply tie or lead her in a couple of polls once most of the primaries have ended and Hillary holds a 200+ pledged delegate lead. 

&gt; Finally, for all the pragmatists in the Democratic establishment, please explain how an FBI investigation makes Hillary Clinton qualified to run our nation. You couldn’t get a job at McDonalds, or a job anywhere in the country, telling your employer that you have an upcoming interview with the FBI. 

I'm fairly certain McDonalds has hired worse. And since when is an investigation equated to guilt? Hell, Presidents have done worse than this. How was a genocidal Native American killer able to become President? How about a man who served for 3 years despite never even being nationally elected?

Nides was also involved in the [scandal](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/12/ethics_complaint_seeks_to_uncover_facts_in_hillary_influencepeddling_scandal.html) involving Clinton’s efforts to provide special access to State Department officials for hedge fund clients of her son-in-law, Marc Mezinsky.

Wow.

"1067","1460750890","&gt;Judicial Watch announced today it has obtained new documents from the Department of State containing the telephone transcripts from the evening of September 11, 2012, in which then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informs then-Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil that the deadly terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi “had nothing to do with the film.”  The documents include previously unreleased telephone transcripts with world leaders about the Benghazi attack.

&gt;Clinton’s admission to Kandil was first produced to the Select Committee on Benghazi on October 13, 2015 and publicized on the day of Mrs. Clinton’s testimony, October 22, but court filings in Judicial Watch litigation show that the record was only produced after two federal court judges ordered the State Department to produce more Benghazi-related records to Judicial Watch.  Similarly, Judicial Watch litigation also forced the release of the September 11, 2012 email in which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed her daughter by email that the attack had been staged by an “Al Qaeda-like group,” rather than as the result of “inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” as Mrs. Clinton had claimed in her official public statement one hour earlier."

Well for one it puts the lie to her claims that Benghazi was touched off by the video, which is what she and her envoys preached for weeks afterward, including to the families of the dead.

At 10:08 p.m. on September 11, Mrs. Clinton issued an official State Department press statement, approved by the White House, placing the blame for the attack on an Internet video:

...

Yet the next day, in her 7:49 PM September 12 conversation with 
Kandil, Clinton said, “We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do 
with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest.” Kandil 
responded, “You’re not kidding. Based on the information we saw today we
believe that group that claimed responsibility for this is affiliated 
with al-Qaeda.”

So by the very next evening she was talking to world leaders and telling them they knew it wasn't about a video. It was terrorism, straight up. But they changed the talking points to hide the terrorism angle because it was an election year and Obama had been running on the platform that al Qaeda and other terror orgs were ""on the run.""

It was a baldfaced lie told to the American people, and it was told so Obama could retain the White House and Hillary could still pretend that Libya was a feather in her cap for 2016, instead of a miserable failure."

1.) to keep the pressure on and keep talking about these subjects and not let the media push them into the shadows again.
2.) to aggressively challenge any and all voter dis-enfranchisements. Voting should be a constitutional right! Americans should have the right to vote in a fair process free of party corruptions, free of gerrymandering, and free of false choices between 'lesser of two evils'. How to accomplish that technically?

a) All citizens should be mandated to vote, but given the options of 'None of the above' also. There should be a fine of $2,000 for failing to mail in ballot (see step 'e' below).
b.) Congressional districts should be fairly drawn. Look to Arizona's recently upheld laws about a process that can work.
c.) Voting should be preferably Olympic style, where you rate each candidate on a scale from 1-100; alternatively, a ranked voting system.
d.) Voting laws and statutes should be federalized. This silly hodgepodge of state laws that have incompetents running them is a gigantic embarrassment.  
e.) All states should switch to vote by mail.
f.) Each ballot should have a durable carbon copy record for auditing purposes that shall remain legible at least 10 years in the humid Southeast.
g.) Vote tallying or counting machines must be audited regularly and rigorously using statistical sampling. "

"1178","1460758575","From the Jerusalem Post: http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Bernie-Sanders-deserves-our-support-450911

&gt; As someone whose family members perished in the Holocaust, Sanders knows about the ongoing threats to the Jewish people, and our need to respond to those threats decisively. You may not agree with everything he says, but you can trust that when he says he is “committed not just to guaranteeing Israel’s survival, but also to its people’s right to live in peace and security,” he means it. All the presidential frontrunners declared their commitment to Israel, but only one has a true and honest relationship with the state. Given his record, his courage and his word, he deserves the support of the Jewish people."
"1179","1460760058","Bernie is right and it takes enormous courage to speak out about Isreali over reaction.  Bravo, a man of his convictions who refuses to pander.  "

"1182","1460763115","Accusing Israel of ""disproportionate response"" is meaningless nonsense that makes zero sense. Should Israel fire exactly one missile for every rocket fired by Hamas? 

Sanders himself couldn't explain what he meant by that, or what he would have done differently if he was in Israel's shoes.

The truth is that war isn't a game. It doesn't work that way. Based on his logic, the US response to pearl Harbor was disproportionate as well.

""Needs more research,"" to me, sounds like ""we need more time to get our ducks in a row before legalizing it so we can profit as much as possible."" No more research is needed. Marijuana prohibition is outright wrong, when you consider alcohol and tobacco, and *especially* when you consider the medicinal benefits of marijuana."
"1184","1460728673","I think this issue can be won in a similar fashion to gay rights.  Already there are a number a organisations pushing MJ reform, but what's needed is what happened with gay rights - people to make public their 'secret lives'; to admit they've smoked MJ and have been successful in life, have chosen it perhaps as an alternative to alcohol, or to say it's their lungs, their head.

Citing hundreds of thousands of annual marijuana arrests, racial and economic disparities in marijuana enforcement, and the role of prohibition in keeping marijuana prices high and lucrative to violent drug dealers, the physicians say that creating a legal and regulated marijuana market is the best way to ensure public safety, combat the illicit drug trade and roll back the negative consequences of strict enforcement policies on disadvantaged communities."

Bernie Sanders wasnt supposed to happen. A radically left (by American standards), 74 year old man with a squeaky clean past and a progressive message comes out of nowhere and gains huge support. Who would have guessed this would happen? If it wasnt for Bernie Sanders, the attacks on Hillarys integrity would never have gained steam, at least not among anybody other than hardcore republicans and hardcore leftists. 

Hillarys biggest problem is she is treating the race for the Presidency like a job application process. If I worked somewhere and I saw people rising through the ranks through nepotism and corruption and being pat on the back the whole way through, but then when I tried to do the same thing everybody was quizzing me about corruption and nepotism, then I'd be pissed off. I'd demand a fair playing field. This is how Hillary see's the election. The thing is, the electorate isnt interested in fairness of consistency. The electorate doesnt feel like they owe Hillary anything just because she played all the right cards and shook all the right hands. The electorate wants change, and Hillary represents everything but change.

I'll offer one thing further. Are guns designed to primarily kill people with malicious intent?

But he hasn't had the negative campaigns against him for years on end that she has. If Sanders had been targeted by the GOP and right wing media in the way that Clinton has, I expect that public opinion about him would be pretty different to what it is now. 

It reminds me of a recent UK poll on whether people trusted David Cameron more or less a week after his Panama Papers exposure. Belief in his trustworthiness plummeted in that week. A Sky News anchor commented drily that it was hardly surprising, given that for a week Cameron had been the target of all the news media who slammed him in the most derogatory and dramatic way possible. 

Personally I don't trust somebody who paints themselves as a saint. I believe that we’re seeing the real Bernie Sanders now, and that he’s doing what he's always been champing at the bit to do; attacking Hillary Clinton as strongly as he can. It's very obvious how much he is enjoying it.

"1400","1460703012","You can almost understand what she is saying: *if a left-wing Dem congress put a $15 federal minimum wage bill on her desk*, she would sign it. But she doesn't believe the political will is there, so she won't advocate or fight for it, because that's not ""pragmatic"" or politically viable.

This has been the Dem party for years: we're with you on single payer, ending the drug war, raising minimum wage, free education, etc. But it's too hard, we need incrementalism! This crazy left-wing shit will lose against the GOP.

Hillary is basically saying: elect me President because I'll bargain down what we believe into what we can get. But it's a hugely uninspiring message from a leader, so she twists herself into knots trying to explain how she's with you, but not, but really she is, except she can't be.

And it's all made so absurd by the guy standing next to her, who against the huge stacked deck in Hillary's favor is running neck and neck with her in this primary, has higher favorability and polling better in all the GE polls and actually is openly advocating for those things.

The Clinton revolution was basically founded on ""New Dems"" newfound role as hippie punchers, so triangulating against a hippie is making Hillary sound increasingly schizophrenic."
"1401","1460692526","She looked so bad in this answer because it truly seemed like she was trying to mislead people into thinking she's for a $15 federal minimum wage. If that's not what you're for just explain your stance please."
"1402","1460719015","it seemed like a fairly straight forward answer. Her stance is to push for a federal minimum of $12. If a bill somehow passes for $15, she is more than happy to sign it. 

But the bill she would put forward to congress if there isn't already legislation in the works, is $12"
"1403","1460692438","Hilary is very confusing and obtuse in her answers."
"1404","1460694201","At least she gave a long diatribe on why @12 minimum is a step toward $15.  She couldn't give one reason for why she would oppose breaking up big banks.  Instead she refused to answer the question, repeatedly.  Then she claimed that it wasn't ""fair"" to ask her to release her $200,000  Wall St. speech transcripts because the ""other candidate"" won't.  We all know Bernie has no Wall St speeches but she is pretending otherwise. She will say anything no matter how ridiculous to win. "
"1405","1460723100","You have to be pretty dense to not understand her minimum wage argument. 12 as a baseline and a push for 15 in places that can handle economically. How is that hard?"
"1406","1460721331","Not confusing if you understand how the world works. Same with converting to renewables. You have to make huge changes in phases, otherwise you get very bad side effects.  You can't just jack up minimum wage to 15 everywhere (nor should you as the cost of living in Manhattan and San Francisco is WAY different from places like Alabama and Montana ) immediately without bad consquences."
"1407","1460705894","There was nothing confusing about it at all. She's in favor of a federal, nationwide minimum wage of $12. She's in favor of higher minimum wages in states and cities like New York where the cost of living is higher."
"1408","1460709046","Honestly, I felt way more persuaded by Clinton than by Bernie. And wtf, that wasn't a hard answer to follow at all? A $15 minimum wage would work in some states, but what about the inner ones? What about small businesses? And just how feasible is getting $15 passed under a Republican congress? In essence her answer seemed like ""$15 is the long term goal, let's work in increments towards that goal, $12 seems more feasible,"" no?"
"1409","1460715245","I don't see how any reasonably intelligent person could be confused. She supports a $12 minimum wage, but she would also encourage officials in areas with a high cost of living to go to $15.

Also, let's be clear: an immediate doubling of the minimum wage on a national level is a recipe for disaster. $15/hr is more than 85% of the current median wage, and it would be the highest minimum wage in the world.

As Clinton says, we can get to $15, but we need to do it incrementally. We saw under Bush what happens when you implement large, immediate economic changes. At a time we've finally gotten back to low unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates, why would we want to risk throwing it all away? 

Why would we refuse to be cautious when most economists of all political stripes are saying that a $15 minimum wage is too high?

It seems to me that the problem here isn't Clinton's perfectly understandable answer during the debate, but Sanders' refusal to compromise or listen to others' points of view."
"1410","1460720963","The answer seems weird but it makes sense when you consider how hard it is to get any legislation to the desk of the president. I'm sure Hillary's first choice would be a $12 national minimum wage, but if congress were to pass a $15 dollar one I'm sure she wouldn't veto it. It makes perfect sense."
"1411","1460725471","I'm a Bernie supporter, but this is where I agree with Clinton. I believe $12 is a fair minimum wage nationally. Some areas like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco need more. However, I think $15 nationally is too high. Some 15 year old kid in bumfuck Nebraska doesn't need $15 an hour. It could dry up jobs and push automation along faster."
"1412","1460721217","Minimum wage hikes hurt small businesses. Makes sense that a local place out in the countryside wouldn't have to pay as much, even more so since living in the country is cheaper."
"1413","1460729765","So the REAL answer is NO.  She does not support a $15 minimal.  She supports $12, but isn't willing to say that, because that $3 could cost her some votes. "
"1414","1460733003","It's not that she was inarticulate. She was trying to say something technically correct that would still mislead a casual listener to believing she favors a $15/hr minimum wage. She did the same shit with her answer about carbon taxing, and a similar thing with her nonanswer about whether Israel's bombing of Gaza was disproportionate (a fair yes or no question).

 She doesn't even want to say clearly what she believes when it's about a divisive issue because any clear answer is bound to piss off some group of people, so she mealy mouths her answers and tries to have it both ways. It's goddamn infuriating to listen to."
"1415","1460714202","What's so confusing? It was pretty clear: if you support the $15 min wage, then I support the $15 min wage, if you support the $12 min wage, them I support the $12 min wage.

It's very much in line with the rest of her platform: I support whatever gets me more votes."
"1416","1460695682","This is a clear example of HRC displaying her moderate tendencies. She touts herself as a ""progressive that likes to get things done"", but she simply whiffed on her confusing answer. 

Raising the minimum wage to $15 is the one of answers* to the growing welfare problem. If all these people making minimum wage of $7.25/hr and  receiving welfare benefits are making $15/hr, it disqualifies them for many welfare programs.

Edit* changed from the one answer"

&gt;""No, I won't release the transcripts, and here's why. **Bernie Sanders doesn't care what I said**. Not one bit. He hates that I made the speeches. He acts like he doesn't understand how professional speakers make their money. If I gave a corporate group a ra-ra luncheon speech or told them to clean up their acts, he doesn't care. He will vilify me if I don't release the transcripts, through insinuation and suggestion, and he will pick apart every word of every transcript if I do, to try and show me as a corrupt person. Unlike Senator Sanders, I am used to the damage, pain, and unnecessary energy that gets dedicated to useless endeavours like this.

&gt;After I left the public sector, for a while I worked and made money giving speeches. It's called private sector employment, something Senator Sanders probably doesn't remember. I'm proud that I built up a resume that allowed me to make good money giving speeches, like inspirational figures all over the world do. Business, charities, universities, all valued my time, and I was happy to give speeches about topics of my choosing.

&gt;No matter how much he insinuates, or how many sarcastic comments he makes, it will not change the fact that I will not release the transcripts of those speeches, my private work, unless I see a good reason to do so. If he wants to google ""speakers bureau"" and educate himself on how professional speaking works, he can.""

Yes, it's condescending. Yes,  it's denying some people what they want. But I don't see how her obvious lie and dodge is benefiting her, particularly as she has to repeat it over and over.

The president did not understand how “Don’t do stupid shit” could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that **“the questions we were asking in the White House were ‘Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus?

The only way these rules will ever change is to know them, follow them, and then vote for candidates who promote something simpler, something more democratic, something more open.

How does this change anything? The transcripts are to establish whether or not there is a conflict of interest. Why would people make this into a petty ""omg you go first"" argument? They can both be guilty, so why wouldn't you all expect to see both things? 

Hillary supporters should be all for her releasing the transcripts if they truly believe they were innocent little speeches, it'll make it all go away and prove she's on your side.

Bernie supporters should be all for the tax returns to prove he's putting his money where his mouth is and not dodging taxes.

This isn't a fucking game, it's not about picking teams. You should be expecting whoever you support to release their respective things, to further your support, and prove that they deserve it. 
"
"1688","1460698361","I would say that I don't understand why this is such a big issue but I do understand why. Sanders hasn't released them, it's been weeks and he hasn't released these tax returns the same returns which Hillary has released. People make the claims that he couldn't be bothered to return home while on the campaign trail but Mitt Romney was also on the rigorous trail and Romney didn't get a pass for it. Neither should Sanders. He claims that his wife handles the taxes, and that is good and fine, but if that's true there is no reason why she can't fly to Vermont grab em' and fly back. The wait to get them has caused this mess and he could've easily put it to bed. "

Francis’ view that a global economic system focused on maximizing profits was destroying the poor and the environment has landed hard in a country considered the world headquarters for capitalism.
Sanchez Sorondo insisted Francis is not anti-capitalist and said the pope admires America for the principles of the Founding Fathers, who influenced the independence movement in his native Argentina. But Francis’ outlook is also shaped by another history, including U.S. ties with Latin American dictators, America’s treatment of Mexican and Central American immigrants, and longstanding U.S. policy toward Cuba, Sanchez Sorondo said. Francis recently helped negotiate a historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations that has led to restored diplomatic ties between the countries."

People really didn't understand how bad it was until the seafood canned goods industry was partly exposed for using slave labor while the US took no stance on the issue until it became a public outrage.

The other public outrage is they don't use tariffs, or enough tariffs, to increase the cost of goods coming out of those regimes where workers are treated like disposable condoms.

Opponents have at least as good of a basis for their counterargument: That advocates for trans acceptance are playing misleading language games by calling ""trans girls"" girls (when clearly most of them are not) and attempting to foreclose any argument that way. 

As for the scenario being fictitious, I have yet to have someone explain to me in a non-hand-waving way why only bona fide trans women, and not any male poseur, would be able to use the women's locker room under these ordinances.

But if I were the DNC, I'd look very hard at two things:

First, Clinton is losing steam at a terrifying rate. She's a terrible candidate with more baggage than a cruise ship. The people who seem to like her the most are the ones terrified that Trump or Cruz has any chance of winning. Ironically, she seems hell-bent on giving one of them a good shot at it.

Second, young people are sick and tired of both parties. Their natural affinities seem mostly to be on the Democratic side, but there are hardly any real, old-school Democrats left. Elizabeth Warren and who else? Sanders, but he only just joined the party.

Yet instead of courting the generation of voters who represent the future of the country, Clinton and the DNC have doubled down on the neoconservative, top-down, war-loving, corporate police state policies that wrecked America's trust in government. The policies these young folks hate, because they're crushing their chances of a decent future.

So right there you have about the stupidest positioning I have ever seen from the Democratic party. It's damn lucky the Republicans have gone completely insane. Otherwise it would be the Democrats going down in flames.

"2013","1460713913","Because people are tired of protests that are nothing more than attention grabbing with no actual plan beyond ""look at me!""

Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to **waste** energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does **nothing** by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT HE COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. The marches were just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength of what MLK and Marshall did was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not the protests.

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the protests by themselves.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 


TLDR; Protests by themselves have NEVER been effective. Look what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective. Nothing else. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself in isolation is the best way to make an change. "

She showed an incredibly in-depth understanding of energy policy when putting her plans into action in Alaska. She simultaneously put into place plans to increase oil and natural gas production, while creating a committee to manage and monitor climate change, and monitor it's impact to Alaska. 

So she says that climate change is real, but the claim that it is man made is unproven, and steps currently being taken nationwide to fight it are a hoax, and she fought special protections for beluga whales and polar bears.

But on the flip side she made many appointments and created an apparatus for Alaskan's to more and better informed control of their environment.

She went through a layer of laws, appointments and policy to create plans for oil, natural gas and reconfiguring gasoline tax policy for the state.

What this all amounts to is that she has likely spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in hearings on oil, gas, the environment, endangered species, pollution, environmental impact, etc. and has heard from both private and public sector experts on these issues.

Somebody is going to be convicted of something. The only question is, will Hillary be amongst the convicted, and if she's not, will she survive politically if people close to her are convicted?

I feel like the obnoxious way she's dismissed any allegation that her or her associates did anything wrong will make her look a bit ridiculous when the FBI convicts someone in her circle.

Also, the fact that they're moving SO carefully and SO slowly, and the business with extraditing Guccifer, etc, it seems to me that they would not go to such painstaking lengths and seemingly be walking on eggshells if they were not going after Hillary but merely one of her aides.

If any of you have worked in the DoD or anything remotely like it... you should be familiar with the stringent policies involving handling classified or even unclassified data.

You can lose a security clearance simply for having too much debt.  Or for earning lots of unexplainable income. Having foreign national ties etc etc.  

So how is it, that a person who attempted to delete thousands of emails from a private server that never should have existed in the first place... is even remotely able to hold any level of a clearance.  The fact is that holding a clearance is largely determined by ones trustworthiness.  How is it that she is even eligible to hold a clearance?  Adding to that.. if she isn't trustworthy enough to hold a clearance... how can she even remotely apply for a job that requires her to have a clearance.



If literally any other person in the world had done anything even remotely similar... they would lose their clearance and get walked out of whatever building they worked in. No questions or debate.

It doesn't even matter if they indict her.... the fact is that she has proven that she isn't careful enough with sensitive material to hold a clearance, which by all principal should mandate that she actually in fact is not qualified to run for any office.

Most importantly, however, FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan site, debunked this drivel a year ago: http://www.factcheck.org/2015/04/gender-pay-gap-in-clintons-senate-office/"
"2358","1460669425","""The top 10 highest-paid staffers on Bernie Sanders’ campaign are all men. However, looking at the campaign as a whole, women’s average salaries are a little under $1,000 *more* than the men’s salaries."""
"2359","1460690407","Politicians should be held to a high level of scrutiny, but journalists have a responsibility to do their homework. At best this article is sloppy reporting perpetuating a trope of HRC that is in my opinion unfair. 

Saying that ""Mrs. Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents to every dollar that male staffers were paid -- a fact confirmed by the Clinton campaign"" follows a lazy line of logic and reasoning that ignores the reality of why women are paid less than their male counterparts. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, women are paid less than men because of ""the high cost of temporal flexibility [which is] the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable."" For various reasons, because women desire greater flexibility in the work week, this impacts take home pay. For someone to insinuate that a woman who has staked her career on gender equality is being hypocritical about gender equality is... well... dumb.   

NPR link is to a 4 minute interview with Professor Goldin explaining this concept.

If a male doctor is paid 100k and a female nurse is paid 50k, you could say that women are paid 50 cents for every dollar a man earns but that really doesn't account for the fact the jobs are different.  

With Ms. Clinton, that probably means the senior staff that got paid significantly more, were weighted more to males.  While there may have been bias, the given statement is misleading at best. "
"2365","1460691052","Let's say she hired two people:

1 male CFO – $100,000 salary

Youths paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for courses that have no practical application or no job opportunities is stupid. Its unfortunate that action needs to be taken to stop this but clearly today's kids who are so infatilised that they can't handle chalk shouldn't be provided easy access to such massive sums of money and organisations shouldn't be given the opportunity to manipulate youths into spending that special credit.

We're nearing the general election and I thought since they were in Donald's home state I might as well get a glimpse at what's coming towards us in the general election. Besides that, I wanted to have a look at Bernie Sanders debating live on TV.
I assume, everyone has seen Hillary Clinton in some way or another over the last twenty years. I'm sure everyone has at least once seen her talk, debate, shriek, or barf on national TV. Bernie on the other hand?
I mean, I read the guys policies, listened to his ideas and studied his tax plan and got a general idea of the BrownShirt-crowd that supports him. I knew the guy is extremely delusional, a patronizing racist, a socialist, voted against cracking down child molestation, voted against the anti-sex offender legislation, claims he never flip-flopped despite the fact he's on tape flip flopping on almost everything (including gay marriage) was unemployed until he was like 40, never worked a day in the private sector in his entire life, probably doesn't even know how to spell 'economics' and is a pathological liar about his financial situation... But that's nothing compared to how incompetent this guy is at debating.
He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

He can't stand still for more than like 2 seconds, he flails with his arms like an idiot when he talks and looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum, he has absolutely no charisma or body language, is a rhetorical catastrophe, and, again like a toddler, he simply starts shouting and screaming when he hears questions or remarks he doesn't want to hear.
And his answering the questions. Oh my god...
I mean from the god emperor we know by now that he will answer any question directly. He gets heat for that, but at least you know where he stands.
Clinton, on the other hand, is the perfect establishment example. She's capable of not answering a question in at least 5,000 different ways. ""Madam secretary, why don't you release your Goldman Sachs speeches?"" - ""Well, during 9/11, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla"" - ""Madame secretary. I was talking about the Goldman Sachs speeches. Will you release them?"" - ""Look. We don't have an issue here. During the wall street crisis, I was the only candidate on this stage that... blabla""
Sanders, though... Let me put it this way: I really wish Chris Christie was at this debate too, just so he could call out Bernie the Robot. It was practically a Rubio-bot moment over and over again. They guy did answer every single question with the same stupid sentence over and over again. I mean, if you thought Rubio was a bad debater because he repeated himself 4 or 5 times, wait until you have the pleasure to listen to this guy repeating himself for an entire evening!
When he gets asked about a specific topic a second time he just repeats the previous answer shouting a little louder and flailing a bit more.
Imagine that guy going up against Putin. It would be a complete embarrassment for the United states.
Tl;DR
I honestly don't get why Reddit glorifies this complete loser?
Nothing about Bernie Sanders is even remotely presidential. Between his condescending, sarcastic, and sloppy demeanor to his unorganized ranting, he comes off as an unprepared, ornery, crotchety activist loser who repeats the same unsubstantive answer over and over again. The fact that he's garnered this much support among young people (anyone actually) absolutely baffles me.

Starting with New York.

New Marist College poll has Clinton up 17 points: 	Clinton 57% to Sanders 40%.

538 just bumped up Clinton as a result to +15 point lead.

Also current Clinton chances to win NY bumped up to 99% from 98%.

 http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-york-democratic/

According to 538's revised goals Bernie's' targets have risen from 125 out of 247  to 128.  But since these were calculated, even though Bernie has won both Wisconsin and Wyoming, he was a total of 6 delegates short of his new targets in those two races.  

Winning the original goal in New York (125 delegates) means about a 1% vote margin.  

Winning the revised goal (128) means about 4%.

Also catching up the 6 delegates (+134) means about 6% win in New York.

Clinton is still about 16 points ahead (approx 40 delegates), but it is closing and just over a week to go.  




(http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-really-hard-to-get-bernie-sanders-988-more-delegates/) 

What do the current polls look like the the remaining primaries?   According to 528, he is behind in every primary on their list.  Clinton's lowest lead is 6 percentage points, her largest 25 percentage points. (These numbers are two days old.)

Conn Clinton +6

Maryland Clinton +22

Penn  Clinton +14

CA  Clinton +11

NJ  Clinton +25

"2689","1460701278","Most aren't denying the importance of infrastructure.  Most are debating the methods which should be used to pay for it.  The author makes anyone who is against ""sticking it to the man"" appear unintelligent.  The reality is, money which a company makes, can only have 3 things that can be done with it:

1.)  It can be paid out in the form of salaries, shareholder dividends, and bonuses.  All of these things are taxed.

2.)  It can be reinvested in the company by buying new equipment, paying off loans, hiring new employees, and expansions.  The more the company expands, the more it will require new employees, who will grow the tax base.  If they buy machinery, another company grows, or stays afloat.  People work for that company a day longer because of that.  Those people are taxed.

3.)  It can be saved, or as some say, ""hoarded.""  While I doubt the people who say this will call squirrels who bury their nuts as greedy hoarders, I will further clarify.  Corporations like Apple are always viewed as greedy and terrible for having such large cash reserves.  When a company gets that big, it damn well better have a big cushion.  Remember how crazy it sounded when the government bailed out banks and insurance companies that were ""too big to fail,"" and we were up in arms about tax payers subsidizing their mistakes?  Well, if Apple ever has some crisis like that, they are billions of dollars of cash reserves away from begging for tax payer money to keep the company and its thousands of employees afloat.  Technology changes.  Apple won't always be the front runner.  That money will eventually be spent.  There is no long term incentive to just stash the money under a mattress.  When the money gets paid out to PEOPLE...then tax it.  

I didn't like it when Mitt Romney said corporations are people.  I don't think corporations should be allowed to use corporate cash to pay for political campaigns...because they actually aren't people.  If you're not a person, you should not be taxed to keep a government afloat that exists for the greater good of the people.  The people should.

If you need more tax revenues, fine.  Tax us people so we can show up at the ballot box when they tax us too high.  If you want companies to stop lobbying to influence elections, stop taxing them.  The money will eventually be taxed....I'd rather 300 million people angry about their taxes influence politicians instead of 100 corporations angry about their taxes."

Look at Canada's debates: well moderated discussion between the candidates without audience. You get straight to the issues, there's less sarcasm, and you hear straight forward answers.  Retorts are made to the candidate and not to the audience.  When candidates agree, they say so directly instead of diverting to a stump speech.

While debates are good, god do I hate the spectator sport that it's become."

So, it looks like it included social media and blogs and other online media along with traditional cnn.com, abcnews.com and fox.com..

Irritating and disconcerting, but no tide-turning scandal. 

My own problem was having a poll worker set me up in the machine as a Republican, then getting pissed off when I pointed out this was wrong. I had another problem with same poll worker on some recent millage tax, insisting that I wasn't in the book until I firmly moved his hand to show I was clearly there. This isn't even the second time I've noticed him pulling stuff like this. It's nearly every election since I moved across town. He does seem a little addled from age, but that might actually be the reason why it's so easy to catch him, not why he's doing it. 

Edit: probably should add that while this doesn't quite merit /s tag, my cynicism runs deep. I well understand proportional award of delegates,  but also know how broken the system is, especially in places like Louisiana. If I called breathlessly to a local election official with how several people I know plus dozens upon dozens of people on Internet were disenfranchised, it would all be shrugged off.

&gt; 1) In Yavapai County Arizona exit polls made by the Daily Courier pointed to a Sanders victory Sanders 63%, Clinton 37%. Main stream media reported a Clinton victory in the county: Clinton 59%, Sanders 43%. This reflects a 37% flip in outcome and this makes questions of election fraud not unreasonable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By including the unadjusted exit poll data from NEP (National Exit Poll organization) we can see that Sanders’ exit polls are higher than his reported vote shares in 17 of 18 primaries. This observation alone lets the statistical cat out of the bag. It is as if we flipped a coin 18 times and it came down heads 17times. The chances of that happening with a fair coin are 7 times out of 100,000. The reported pattern of election data for Sanders is equally unlikely, and we would not be unreasonable to conclude that the data indicates election fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) We also note that Sanders has done better in caucuses than in primaries. In primaries Sanders has a 41% vote share. In caucuses he has a 66% vote share. There is a 97.8% probability that this difference is not due to chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, statistical analysis of election data from presidential elections from the previous six decades indicate the likelihood that four presidential victories were fraudulent.

Additionally Richard Charnin has posted analysis that proposes that the democratic primary results for both [Massachusetts](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/) and [Wisconsin](https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/a-preliminary-probability-analysis-of-the-wisconsin-primary/), are suspect. Finally, because the National Election Pool, (NEP), Exit Poll data is privately owned, the Election Integrity organization [states](http://electionintegrity.net/faq.cgi);

&gt; The data needed to fully investigate the integrity of the election has never been made available to independent researchers. Rather, it remains the property of the NEP consortium that commissioned the exit polls, which says it cannot be released. Data has been made available, but not the data that could be used to verify the validity of the election. In the future, it’s unlikely that any media poll will even let us know about any exit poll discrepancy. (For this reason and more, we have undertaken to develop an independent exit poll.)

They're working to change this and maintain a [website](http://electionintegrity.net/) and Google Groups forum, ([1](http://electionintegrity.net/forum.cgi)., [2](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ElectionIntegrity).), to discuss these issues."

Anyways in order for this to be a conspiracy the change would have to benefit someone. I just don't see how anyone could benefit with certainty. Sure you could say Hillary benefited from me not being able to vote. But no one would have any idea if I was going to vote for Hillary of Bernie. It would be a crap shoot as to which vote got nullified.

I have to error more on the side that this more of a database type problem. I saw tons of people in line with me that experienced that same issue.

Then every vote is recounted and the voting records with matching IDs are checked. There's no voter fraud and there's no need to register beforehand. Oh yeah, and we don't deny people the right to vote just because they've had trouble with the law before.

Local, regional and national parliaments are then divided based on the corresponding voter percentages. No first past the post shit. No gerrymandering shit. No electoral college shit. It's basic and it works because it's damn hard to corrupt it.

"2851","1460744196","This column encapsulates Reddit, /r/politics, and /r/SandersforPresident in a nutshell:

&gt;What you see, on this as on multiple issues, is the casual adoption, with no visible effort to check the premises, of a story line that sounds good. It’s all about the big banks; single-payer is there for the taking if only we want it; government spending will yield huge payoffs — not the more modest payoffs conventional Keynesian analysis suggests; Republican support will vanish if we take on corporate media.

&gt;In each case the story runs into big trouble if you do a bit of homework; if not completely wrong, it needs a lot of qualification. But the all-purpose response to anyone who raises questions is that she or he is a member of the establishment, personally corrupt, etc.. Ad hominem attacks aren’t a final line of defense, they’re argument #1.

&gt;I know some people think that I’m obsessing over trivial policy details, but they’re missing the point. *It’s about an attitude, the sense that righteousness excuses you from the need for hard thinking and that any questioning of the righteous is treason to the cause.* **When you see Sanders supporters going over the top about “corporate whores” and such, you’re not seeing a mysterious intrusion of bad behavior into an idealistic movement; you’re seeing the intolerance that was always just under the surface of the movement, right from the start.**

I started out as neutral. I'm not American and I like to watch American politics from afar because I don't have to get emotionally invested and I don't have to eventually pick a side. But then the Sanders supporters got just so very toxic.

**Sanders supporters, you need to pay attention to this:** Your movement is toxic. You've taken it and tarnished it and smeared shit all over it. You've treated everyone who wasn't a True Believer in Bernie Sanders like a pariah, or like they're an evil paid corporate shill. You've acted like condescending assholes that nobody wants to associate with.

You will look back on this one day and you will cringe with embarrassment. You will get involved more deeply in politics one day and you will realize that your actions helped strangle Bernie Sanders's presidential bid in its cradle. You will look back at this and realize that you acted completely contrary to how people need to act in politics to win supporters.

But the thing is, you can't run a campaign based on the premise that your opponent is ""bought"" and then pussy foot around, and then when Hillary plays the victim and says ""you should apologize for suggesting I'm compromised"" and he backpedals instead of saying ""yes you ARE compromised! ""

Everyone in the establishment is warning that Bernie had better be careful and not do anything to permanently damage Hillary. But you KNOW if Bernie were leading Hillary would do everything she could to permanently damage Bernie without hesitation, because all she cares about is winning, despite her claims to the contrary. And nobody in the establishment would come to Bernie's defense and say ""hey back off don't destroy our potential nominee."" And hillary would just be like ""I'm gonna destroy him and then the only choice left will be me whether you like me or not.""

Either the Democrats and Republicans go back to a back-room closed-door nomination process, and then take their chances stuffing that candidate down our throats in the general, or they conduct their primaries and caucuses consistent with election law and basic fairness.  

Both conventions this year will be hotly contested.  We'll see delegates switching, terrible accusations being made, etc. But what we'll mainly see is a question of ""Who is the Party?  Is it the people who register and vote for that Party?  Or is it the few wealthy elites behind the scenes that are the Party?""

"3055","1460652034","I don't expect my comment to get much attention, but I'd like to refute the notion that politicians ALWAYS bow to big donors.  History proves otherwise.

In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt ran a presidential campaign that was rumored to be [75% financed by oil barons and railroad tycoons](http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0807/080797.us.us.2.html). In fact, J.P. Morgan donated $150,000 to his campaign which would be worth over $2 million today.  How did Roosevelt repay their generosity? By passing the [Tillman Act of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) which banned corporations from donating to political campaigns. He's also known as a [trust buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) who broke up big transit, big railroad, and big beef. He even repaid J.P. Morgan directly by breaking up his Northern Securities Company.

I know there are an overwhelming number of Sanders supporters who believe Bernie, and Bernie alone, can challenge the status quo, and save our country from devolving into an oligarchy, but history proves otherwise.  Teddy Roosevelt was the ultimate political insider. A Republican party leader from the age of 22, he was a blue-blooded elite who hobnobbed with the wealthy and well-to-do.  On the surface, he was the LEAST likely politician to stand up to corporate interests. 

He also didn't demonize the elite and wealthy like Bernie Sanders tends to do.  He never called for a ""revolution"".  In fact, he saw socialism as evil and radical - something ordinary citizens will dangerously turn to if their voice is unheard.  It should be avoided. He understood that big business was a vital component to a healthy society, and that business and labor must be kept in balance. Tipping the scales too much in either direction was bad. [Here's what he had to say in 1906](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/tr-muckrake/?flavour=mobile).

&gt;For years, the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in Citizens United was depicted by Democrats as the root of all political evil. But now, the core argument embraced by the Court’s conservatives to justify their ruling has taken center stage in the Democratic primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders – because Clinton supporters, to defend the huge amount of corporate cash on which their candidate is relying, frequently invoke that very same reasoning."

I think this highlights the difference between good law and good policy or morality.  Even when something is legal, it can still be morally wrong.  Just because Clinton legally can solicit donations from Big Finance doesn't mean it reflects well on her as a principled politician.

She's not doing anything illegal but we should still critique her for doing something that is both legal and wrong that compromises her as a champion of the people and shows her to be a sell out to the interests of the rich."

They should do away with super-delegates, caucuses (instead just have a vote), and have all primaries finished by march-ish. The candidate with the most pledged delegates wins, end story. With all the talk of the super-delegates in '08 I am surprised they still exist in this cycle.

In fact, it's that understanding which was behind [the Federal Reserve's lending decisions](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12842.htm) (they opened up multiple lending facilities during the crisis), the [Treasury's insurance of $3 trillion worth of MMF shares](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf), the [Fed reforms of the tri-party repo market](https://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html) and [the SEC reforms of money market funds](https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679). 

Warren doesn't know anything because she's an ideologue, not an intellectual. She doesn't care about what happened or how to prevent it from happening again. Many of her ideas, like the Federal Reserve should not act as a lender of last resort, would *decrease* financial stability and would make it far more likely, that when the next set of runs occurs, the recession will mirror the Great Depression (Great Depression caused by the Fed failing to act as lender of last resort).

"3431","1460646328","&gt; On Friday, Krugman argued that the financial crisis wasn’t really a problem of too big to fail, but rather a failure to regulate so-called shadow banks — a broad term including just about every financial activity beyond traditional loans and deposits.

__

No he didn't, he said that big banks were not alone to blame, and that only regulating big banks wouldn't safeguard against or de-risk future financial crises.

He said that regulation of ""shadow banks"" -- hedge funds and other investment firms that act like banks but are not regulated like banks -- is also needed... and that Sanders' single-minded focus on big banks would leave blind spots in regulation that need more attention.

____

&gt; The easy slogan here is “Break up the big banks.” It’s obvious why this slogan is appealing from a political point of view: Wall Street supplies an excellent cast of villains. But were big banks really at the heart of the financial crisis, and would breaking them up protect us from future crises?

&gt; Many analysts concluded years ago that the answers to both questions were no. Predatory lending was largely carried out by smaller, non-Wall Street institutions like Countrywide Financial; the crisis itself was centered not on big banks but on “shadow banks” like Lehman Brothers that weren’t necessarily that big. And the financial reform that President Obama signed in 2010 made a real effort to address these problems. It could and should be made stronger, but pounding the table about big banks misses the point.

The geographical makeup of the country also gives an unfair advantage to populated areas.

""This is not a question of theology: it is a matter of basic reading comprehension. The FSM Gospel is plainly a work of satire, meant to entertain while making a pointed political statement. To read it as religious doctrine would be little different from grounding a ""religious exercise"" on any other work of fiction."" 

I get what is being said here but it isn't like there is a wealth of supporting evidence for the bible. It's just older fiction as far as any one can prove. Sure there is some evidence that some of the event in there happened in some fashion, but there is nearly as many parts it blatantly gets wrong (i.e. Jewish slaves exodus from egypt) or self contradicts. If you look at all the elements of other much older religions the bible could read like a poorly written satire with out much stretch of the imagination.

Holloway, who worked as a cook in Illinois but is now unemployed and disabled, living with his family in Milwaukee, got a ride downtown to the Vital Records System to try to fix his birth certificate. Vital Records said it would cost between $400 and $600, which Holloway could not afford.

&gt; Three forms of government ID were not good enough; rather, an unemployed cook on disability had to come up with at least 400 clams to fix his own damn birth certificate. 

&gt; The saga continues.

&gt; &gt; He then called the Illinois Vital Records Division, who said he had to personally come to Springfield, the state capitol, to amend his birth certificate. So Holloway bought a $180 round-trip bus ticket and traveled four hours back to his home state. Once in Springfield, the division said it needed a copy of his high-school and vaccination records. Holloway went to his hometown of Decatur to get his school records, paying $20 to his friend for gas money, but after returning to Springfield, Vital Records said it needed his full Social Security statement, which he didn't have.

&gt; &gt; He also visited the Illinois DMV, but had no luck there either. He left Illinois without getting the documents he needed to vote in Wisconsin. Back in Milwaukee, Holloway got two copies of his Social Security statement and asked Illinois Vital Records if he could e-mail or fax them over. They said he'd have to appear in person again. But Holloway didn't have the money to make another trip to Illinois and gave up trying to get a voter ID. He'd spent $200, visited two states, and made seven trips to different public institutions, but still couldn't vote in Wisconsin.

* almost all encryption experts think it is a bad idea, and makes it impossible to secure personal, medical, and financial data.

* terrorists and criminals will always have their own encryption, like PGP.   Or use foreign services.  This will affect only ordinary citizens.

* This bill will hurt US industry, and force anybody who incorporates security to move offshore.

Result: CA nearly went bankrupt in the 80s and 90s because they couldn't raise taxes to generate new revenue.

Just look at Michigan where he was down 20 points, but was able to catch-up and surpass Clinton by focusing a lot of his time and efforts there.
  
Also, regardless of how he does in the debate tonight, he needs to be in NY the next few days spinning a poor performance, or riding the momentum of a good performance.
  
As far as I understand it, he's not meeting with the Pope, and the speech he's giving is closed to the press. So the only reason I can think of why he's going, is that Bernie thinks this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it's just something he personally wants to do.

Sanders will be at the debate till 11pm in New York. Rome is 6 hours ahead of EST so he won't be done with the debate till 5am there. The best travel time to JFK (no traffic) is 34 minutes according to google maps. It is now 5:34am in Rome. The quickest flight time I can see from a quick google search is 8 hours and 35 minutes. This brings us to 2:09 pm in Rome. Assuming no traffic from the airport there to the Vatican it is another 29 minutes of travel, bringing us to 2:38 pm.

He is set to speak at 4:00 pm. All of this does not factor in the time to actually leave the debate following it ending at 11 pm, traffic in either city, the debate running over even by a couple minutes, or any potential delays in either location. Even in this best case scenario he shows up at Vatican City with 1 hour and 20 minutes before he speaks. And the likelihood of there being zero delays is slim to none.

The debates have almost always run over. And the candidates usually linger to talk to reporters, supporters, shake hands. He for sure won't have time for that. Zero traffic in two major cities, especially leaving a large event in one is also very unlikely.
All in all it just seems like a really tight schedule for 10 minutes of speaking. And not to mention the cost of chartering a private jet since no flight leaves in an acceptable window for this trip for him."

"4313","1460660064","&gt; Why are Bernie fans attacking Hillary when ... priority should be defeating Trump or whoever is the Republican nominee?

Not my priority. I don't think Clinton is better than other candidates. This is a myth the DNC wants us to believe. I'm done with voting strategically. I'm voting who I think would make the best president. If Trump gets elected because people vote for Bernie--NOT MY PROBLEM. The Democrats shouldn't have backed a corrupt candidate and expected me to support her. 

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so angry at Hillary when Hillary fans aren’t angry at Bernie?

She's unethical and corrupt. I think she is unfit for high office on those grounds. Besides someone who thinks that Clinton supporters aren't angry at Bernie clearly hasn't spent time in r/HillaryClinton.

&gt; Why are Bernie fans so mean to Hillary fans? 

Don't accept the premise. But, if true, maybe it has something to do with enabling corruption. 

&gt; If Hillary fans are so willing to support Bernie if he’s the Democratic nominee, how come some Bernie fans say they won’t do the same for Hillary? 

Hillary fans clearly don't understand that progressive voters like progressive values and that ethical people don't support corruption. I don't support Hillary because she's not a progressive and she's corrupt.   

&gt; Don’t Bernie fans want America to have its first female president? 

And, bingo!, IMO, there's the actual argument behind most of Hillary's supporters. There's some implication that if I don't support Hillary, I must be against women as president. People are so eager to get a female president they'll vote for a corrupt politician. This is sad.  People, Hillary is not the right person for the job.

"4348","1460679229","Jackson was a ~~badass~~ fucking insane person:

&gt;The next 100 times Andrew Jackson should have died were in duels of honor—the old-fashioned variety, where sometimes men fired their pistols into the air and sometimes they didn't. Often, these run-ins were instigated by talk of Jackson's wife, Rachel, who'd previously been with an abusive husband. Jackson valiantly rescued her from the nasty situation, yet the finality of her divorce at the time of their wedding was questionable at best. Needless to say, this was a sore spot for Jackson, and he wasn't afraid to draw his pistol at any mention of it. In fact, things only got worse when he decided to run for president, as it became the topic of a massive smear campaign. Rachel was called a bigamist more times than she could handle, and she died of a heart attack before she could even make it to the White House.
Although not all of Jackson's duels were near-death experiences, at least two of them were. Once, for instance, he was shot squarely in the chest. Normally, that sort of thing would signal the end of a duel, but Jackson simply staunched the wound with a handkerchief, and then shot and killed his opponent. The bullet, however, was lodged so close to Jackson's heart that it couldn't be removed, and he suffered from chest pains and excessive phlegm for the rest of his life. In another fight, two bullets shattered Jackson's arm and left shoulder. Doctors wanted to amputate, but Jackson refused for fear it would ruin his military career.

Many Verizon employees are being placed on emergency work assignment to fill the position of these union members. My mom has had this lingering assignment weighing over her head since these strike talks began. She also had to participate in this same issue in 2011 when the first phase of strikes began. It is not just the union workers that are being mistreated by this corporation, but the other employees that work hard day-to-day without going on strike to ask for increased wages/benefits. There is more to this story than what is being covered in the news. "
"4731","1460582922","These companies hold private court with our elected officials and then pretend not to see that as an advantage over their employees. I know the only reason I ever contact or send contributions to politicians is either hoping their vote will influence a law or to thank them for great representation.

 A lot of people aren't even making enough to save and yet people will call them greedy for wanting decent wages and working conditions. And a lot of the avenues that we once had to represent that have been eroded away over the years by folks like the heads of Verizon. It's not just Clinton turning a blind eye to or gladhanding this situation, but as far as I know, it ain't Sanders. He seems to be the only person that gets the part I'm worried about."

Remember SOPA - the ""copyright"" legislation before Congress last year that public outcry stopped cold? Well, the same corporations behind SOPA have pushed to insert its most pernicious provisions into TPP. Says who? The organizations that stopped SOPA like the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU.
Under this TPP proposal, Internet Service Providers could be required to ""police"" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.
Violations could be as simple as the creation of a YouTube video with clips from other videos, even if for personal or **educational purposes**.
Mandatory fines would be imposed for individuals' non-commercial copies of copyrighted material. So, downloading some music could be treated the same as large-scale, for-profit copyright violations.
**Innovation would be stifled as the creation and sharing of user-generated content would face new barriers, and as monopoly copyrights would be extended**. The TPP proposes to impose copyright protections for a minimum of 120 years for corporate-created content.
Breaking digital locks for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines. Blind and deaf people also would be harmed by this overreach, as digital locks can block access to audio-supported content and closed captioning."

Totally inverse to the ideal situation: Consumption (VAT) shouldn't be taxed at all, unless you WANT to curb consumption of a certain good because it's harmful for society, things like meat, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, sugar, fat. Labor should be taxed as little as possible, to encourage employment, backed up by that lower tax on consumption and the additional consumption that generates and the jobs that come with it.

"4797","1460647105","As someone with a degree in one of the humanities, it has always made me a tad bit ill that this country has been so willing to sack the arts when it comes to schooling. While math skills and basic literacy are very important, the humanities provide the student with context for the things they've learned elsewhere. Math is a-ok on its own, but we seldom speak of how math came to exist, or how math and the arts have often intertwined. Some of the most important discoveries of all time came from people who meshed together the rigors of the scientific method and the recognition of some greater beauty at its core. If you are to take out the latter, you might not get the best results from the former. The humanities give that additional context; they bolster STEM fields, not weaken them. 

I write, and that's my art. I'm not the best writer of all time, or even all that attentive to the rules consistently. But my appreciation of math and science is borne of my craft, and would probably not exist without it. Being able to recognize that there are deeper truths with wide ranging consequences is important, and that recognition extends to science and math. We teach now, though, shallow truths built around passing standardized tests... And we wonder why students can struggle with them. Humans don't want to get good at something just to pass a test -- they want to feel like their actions have merit and meaning. 

The problem with so much of what we teach is that it is taught as-is, and young people can see it as ultimately meaningless. If you want young people to actually engage, it is better to share the stories with them. We are a species of storytellers, and we would not have a society at all were it not for stories. We are too quick to treat asking ""Why?"" as an annoyance -- but it is perhaps one of the most important questions to ask and find an answer to. 

Standardized testing is the sort of method a society sick of hearing that question would use. I don't have a good solution myself, but I know our current system is sorely lacking. A generation of automatons is not surprising as a result."

* Massachusetts has ~1/3 of New York's population, but has open primaries. This shows either the huge opportunity for either candidate to drive voter turnout on Tuesday, or just how much closed primaries affect turnout, or both.

"4999","1460737844","The points raised in the article are all likely true, but that does not mean that the issue should be dismissed out-of-hand.

If part of the effect is due to ""Women also tend to leave the workforce for periods to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay, and choose careers that tend to have lower pay."", then we need to look at a way to address this. 

When my child was born, I asked my boss if I could work part-time for six months to help my wife out. I wanted to work a ""90%"" schedule where I could take off every other Friday to give my wife a break (I had used up my vacation for parental leave). He looked at me like I had two heads and told me that the logistics of that were too hard to work out (the company is mid-sized, with over 500 employees). He would not let me do this even though I assured him that I could still do 100% of my duties in 90% of the time.

A number of women had part-time schedules in the company, but they were almost universally looked down upon. So there was not only a different standard in allowing part-time work (women could grudgingly get this, men could not), but there was a different opinion given when this was used.

Of course, the ""corporate"" message is ""yes, you should definitely be penalized, career-wise, if you choose to work less"". That is the assumption that needs to be challenged, because we are all humans, we have parents, we have children, and we wouldn't have much of a society if we make child-rearing a taboo corporate activity."
"5000","1460739221","&gt;(BLS data show that women who have never married have virtually no wage gap; they earn nearly 94 cents for every dollar a man makes.)

This still should not be minimized because over time it adds up.  6% of 50,000 is $3,000.  Over 40 years, that is a $120,000 difference.  Or if that difference is invested at 7%, that equates to  almost a $600,000 difference over one's lifetime. "

I feel like the whole concept of a career is completely changing and my generation won't ever see the kind of working environment that generations before us have. Most of the large companies in my area (Microsoft, Amazon, etc) are largely hiring only contract positions, usually they're indefinite but it allows them to withhold benefits and be able to drop large amounts of employees at any time with next to no repercussions. 

I think this approach really makes sense in today's society tbh. I don't know of anyone young that is excited by the idea of knowing they'll be with the same company for 20+ years. Unfortunately the contract workers aren't compensated fairly to be able to provide those benefits for themselves. This 'trend' doesn't seem like it is going to end anytime soon as it is very beneficial for large companies that can replace talent very easily. And it makes more sense to me that the 'benefits' be paid for with our taxes rather than out of pocket. Obviously the cost of it is daunting, but I think it will only makes sense moving forward.

"5123","1460615853","Lies, Damn lies and statistics.

Let me twist the statistics in a few other ways for you:

What if we compare the number of guns to the distance that state is from New York? (which would be implying that people are traveling back and forth between said state and New York to smuggle guns).

Source state | Distance from New York	| Number of guns (2014)
-------------|----------------|------------- 
Connecticut | 97 Miles	| 59
Pennsylvania | 200 Miles	| 371
Vermont | 240 Miles | 55
Virginia | 410 Miles | 395
West Virginia | 484 Miles | 66
North Carolina | 512 Miles | 279
Ohio | 534 Miles | 152
South Carolina | 723 Miles | 256
Georgia | 770 Miles | 386
Tennessee | 918 Miles	| 57
Alabama | 1068 Miles | 91
Florida | 1149 Miles | 292
Texas | 1769 Miles | 103
California | 2438 Miles | 49

So Pennsylvania, which is a bit further away than Vermont provides 7 times the guns. Tennessee, which is more than 3 times the distance from New York to Vermont provides just about the same number of guns as Vermont, and Texas, which is more than 9 times the distance provide almost twice the number of guns Vermont does. West Virginia, which is relatively close to New York provide a rather low number of guns compared to the 2 states that are at similar distance (this will be relevant below).

Hillary's claim that the per capita number of guns is relevant is implying that Vermont **residents** are commuting to New York to commit gun crimes. But how about if we look at how many people actually **move** from a given state to New York instead? (implying that these people people may be bringing their guns with them).

Source state | Number of guns (2014) | Migrants to New York | Migrants per gun
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
West Virginia | 66 | 271 | 4
Georgia | 386 | 6111 | 16
Alabama | 91 | 1662 | 18
South Carolina | 256 | 4796 | 19
Virginia | 395 | 9743 | 25
Ohio | 152 | 4766 | 31
Vermont | 55 | 1933 | 35
North Carolina | 279 | 12174 | 44
Tennessee | 57 | 2957 | 52
Pennsylvania | 371 | 21930 | 59
Florida | 292 | 22356 | 77
Texas | 103 | 12941 | 126
Connecticut | 59 | 14649 | 248
California | 49 | 22241 | 454

Here Vermont is smack in the middle of the field, with the surprising finding that people from West Virginia is more than 4 times more likely than people from ANY other state to be bringing guns with them, when moving to New York (if that is actually what is happening). Texas is now in the opposite end of the scale compared to the previous finding.

If ANY single state should be singled out according to these statistics, it would be Georgia though. It provides the second highest number of guns on an absolute scale *and* when compared to how many people move from that state to New York *and* it is pretty far away from New York as well.

&gt; HILLARY CLINTON: Well, let me again try to put this in context. The Legislature—or the national Legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya. Now, I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it, but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the Constitution and the legal precedents. And as you know, they really undercut their argument by spiriting him out of the country in his pajamas, where they sent, you know, the military to, you know, take him out of his bed and get him out of the country. So this was—this began as a very mixed and difficult situation.

Hillary is stating that the Legislature and the national judiciary followed the law in removing President Zelaya. This is consistent with the Library of Congress legal analysis that the removal was legal and constitutional, but the military did not follow the constitution. The exile was unconstitutional.

[From here.](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/honduras/constitutional-law-issues.php#authority)

&gt; Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system. 

&gt; However, removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution, and apparently this action is currently under investigation by the Honduran authorities.

It's a complex issue. Obama referred to it as a coup, and did cut some aid, but decided to never officially declare it a military coup, since only the exile was technically unconstitutional. As Hillary said in the interview

&gt; If the United States government declares a coup, you immediately have to shut off all aid, including humanitarian aid, the Agency for International Development aid, the support that we were providing at that time for a lot of very poor people. And that triggers a legal necessity. There’s no way to get around it. So, our assessment was, we will just make the situation worse by punishing the Honduran people if we declare a coup and we immediately have to stop all aid for the people, but we should slow off and try to stop anything that the government could take advantage of, without calling it a coup.

later she says

&gt; So, I think, in retrospect, we managed a very difficult situation, without bloodshed, without a civil war, that led to a new election. And I think that was better for the Honduran people. But we have a lot of work to do to try to help stabilize that and deal with corruption, deal with the violence and the gangs and so much else."

"5262","1460576863","Note to all - Hillary was not responsible for the coup. She reacted to it in a way that lead to free and fair elections a few months after it. 

I would like to hear how she and Obama SHOULD have reacted to the coup. 

Label it a military coup, cease aid, and then what -- Try to force Zelaya out of leadership? How do you do that peacefully?

""At a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board on April 8, Clinton was asked about her direct involvement in “the coup in Honduras,” which took place when she was secretary of state.

&gt;As you know in 2009, the military overthrew President Zelaya. There was a period there where the OAS was trying to isolate that regime, but apparently some of the emails that have come out as a result of the State Department releases show that some of your top aides were urging you to declare it a military coup, cut off U.S. aid. You didn’t do that. You ended up negotiating with Oscar Arias [former Costa Rican president] a deal for new elections.

&gt;But the situation in Honduras has continued to deteriorate. There’s been 300 people killed by government forces, and all these children fleeing and mothers from Honduras over the border into United States. And just a few weeks ago, one of the leading environmental activist, Berta Cáceres, was assassinated in her home. Do you have any concerns about the role that you played in that particular situation, even not necessarily being in agreement with your top aides in the State Department?


Clinton responded, **“The legislature, the national legislature in Honduras and the national judiciary actually followed the law in removing President Zelaya.** Now I didn’t like the way it looked or the way they did it but they had a very strong argument that they had followed the constitution and the legal precedence.”


Nearly one month after the military removed Zelaya from power, on July 24, Ambassador Llorens wrote in a U.S. State Embassy cable, “The Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the
military, Supreme Court, and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution.”

The U.S. embassy in Honduras rejected all of the coup defenders’ rationalizations for a “patently illegal act” and outlined the following: “the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the
country”; “Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a Honduran president”; “Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process”; and “Zelaya’s arrest and forced removal from the country violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and right to due process.”


***TL:DR - Hillary got called out for her role in the Honduras Coup, and she backtracked saying it was all legal. At the time of the coup, her ambassador told her it was blatantly illegal. ***"
"5284","1460562093","*insert Trump hairpiece joke here*"
"5285","1460592937","I was one of Dana Frank's graduate students. She is one of the most intelligent human beings I have ever met, and has devoted her life to combating the international injustices committed in South and Central America. I am really excited to see her being critical of Hillary's actions here; if anybody knows anything about the US government's role in Honduras, it is Professor Frank."
"5286","1460588235","The scarier thing about all of this (I mean, really who gives a fuck if yet another latin american banana republic has a forced change of leadership?) is hillary's fluency in revisionist policy.

Beyond that two other things strike me as making her particularly unelectable:

1 - either she knew about US involvement in the coup and was willing to parrot back party line

or 

2 - she was oblivious and just willing to violate US law"

"5288","1460625392","So many people don't know the history of Verizon, and by extension the history of AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T was born from Graham Bell inventing and patenting the telephone in 1876. They spent the next 15 years cruising into a national monopoly on the back of Bell's patent, and when the patent expired, they kept the monopoly by buying up all of their competitors. The US government intervened time and time again with anti-trust suits, but they figured out new ways to keep their monopoly. Vertical integration and consolidation of manufacturing. Lease agreements on hardware that locked out third-parties. List goes on and on.

The government eventually broke AT&amp;T (""Ma Bell"") up in the 1980s into several smaller Baby Bells, but these small regional Bells still had regional monopolies just as a byproduct of infrastructure ownership. Bell Atlantic, with a monopoly in the East Coast spanning New Jersey through Virginia, eventually became the Verizon we know today. Verizon, along with AT&amp;T and other post-breakup telecoms, pumped millions into local governments in the 90s in order to sign franchise deals into law that locked out competition in their regions. They've taken billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies and infrastructure contracts, and they haven't delivered anything they promised in return. We've basically traded the AT&amp;T national monopoly with an oligopoly of post-breakup telecoms that are bending us over the old copper cables and fucking us dry with price hikes non-stop.

The telecom industry is seriously messed up beyond belief. These companies have never been anything other than anti-competitive monopolistic assholes in their entire existence. For the 100+ year history of the industry, it's been just an endless stream of crony capitalism. They don't know how to do anything else. They don't know how to be anything else."

&gt; His first accusation – that Verizon doesn’t pay its fair share of taxes – is just plain wrong. As our financial statements clearly show, we’ve paid more than $15.6 billion in taxes over the last two years – that’s a 35% tax rate in 2015, for anyone who’s counting. We’ve laid out the facts repeatedly and did so again yesterday (see “Sen. Sanders needs to get his facts straight” at Verizon.com/about/news). The senator has started to fudge his language – talking of taxes not paid in some unspecified “given year” – but that doesn’t make his contention any less false.

and

&gt;Sen. Sanders also claims that Verizon doesn’t use its profits to benefit America. Again, a look at the facts says otherwise. In the last two years, Verizon has invested some $35 billion in infrastructure -- virtually all of it in the U.S. -- and paid out more than $16 billion in dividends to the millions of average Americans who invest in our stock. In Sanders’s home state of Vermont alone, Verizon has invested more than $16 million in plant and equipment and pays close to $42 million a year to vendors and suppliers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses. Just yesterday, we announced a $300 million investment to bring fiber to the city of Boston, which will make it one of the most technologically advanced cities in the nation and expand broadband access for its residents. Boston’s Mayor Walsh is partnering with us on this initiative, calling it crucial for providing the foundation for future technology growth. We’re making significant investments in New York City, Philadelphia and other metro areas throughout our wireline footprint.

Verizon creates a ton of jobs and has invested pretty heavily in the United States. They're a really stupid target for Sanders to try to paint as the ""poster child for corporate greed"".



As to this article, this stood out:

&gt; Among the supporters, Tanner McMhan, 22 a New York University student, said that the most important reason to support Mr Sanders was his promise to reform campaign finance, which was, in his view, “so messed up”.

"5296","1460627474","What people tend to forget is that Verizon and other US utility companies are stewards of a publicly owned resource.  Mainly the utility poles, trenches and limited usable frequencies that all traverse public space to connect us all together.  It is very similar to our interstates and roadways.  Imagine the horror if those were privately operated.

Utility companies main value is derived from selling us access to these publicly owned resources.  Their infrastructure was built and is maintained with the help of taxes and fees (the ones you see on your phone bill) under the assumption that they operate in the public's interest.

Over the years they have used this publicly funded infrastructure to become some of the largest and wealthiest companies on the planet.  From that position they have been able to influence laws an regulations to entrench their position and prevent meaningful competition which has severely stifled innovation in the US as compared to other countries that better regulate these public resources.

The US economy is being deflated, one sector at a time, and has been for a good 20 years if not more. The cost of clothing has probably gone down the most because the labor is now in Malaysian sweat shops. Food is somewhat cheaper because of huge agri-business and the fact that a lot of food is sourced from overseas. Housing hasn't gone down that much, though illegal immigrants working in the building trade have had a small impact.

Things like toys, books, electronics, cars, and most of the rest of our consumer economy have gone down (or at least haven't risen as much as inflation) due to these global pressures. I remember in 1990 when a VCR (made in Japan) cost $500 - now you can get something similar (DVD recorder) for $200, which is like $100 in 1990 dollars.

The cost of government, however, has not gone down, because there is no global pressure. So as people in many different industries have lost their jobs to overseas pressures and have had to find work for less money, government workers have not.

I'm not saying this to make the case that we should pay government workers less - I don't think that at all. I'm pointing out, however, how the dismantling of our economy directly impacts this issue. "

The U.S. Constitution says nothing about political parties, which are private enterprises able to set their own rules. It takes a blatant example like the recent Republican caucus in Colorado — where voters were entirely cut out of the process and Cruz was awarded all the state's delegates — to make that abundantly clear.

&gt;I think the big takeaway in this election cycle is how little the popular vote matters because of Citizens United.

Continuing:

&gt;Are we really a democratic republic, or are we an oligarchy because of Citizens United ? The U.S. Constitution says nothing about political parties, which are private enterprises able to set their own rules because of Citizens United. 

&gt;Voters may feel disenfranchised, disgusted and downright angry because of Citizens United.

Revolutions happen in history books and in other parts of the world, not in modern-day America because of Citizens United.

I know that nuclear power is generally considered safe, but accidents can and do happen, and by increasing the exposure to that risk we greatly increase our chances of a catastrophic event.

Then if you're accepted, it costs $200,000 to register! (The whole state is allowed 50 growers/processors and 25 dispensaries. Becoming a dispensary isn't this costly btw. But let's focus on growers because there is no dispensary without product and the law says that dispensaries cannot also grow.) This is before you invest any money into the actual business. Okay, that's bad. But wait! The risk increases and becomes quite substantial as you go along and start to realize that there is no pricing structure in this bill. That means no one knows or can predict what this medicine will cost. And the state is not regulating it. Wouldn't you want to regulate the costs of a medicine? Especially if you are trying to ""help the children""? Don't want to price out poor kids, right? Well, maybe. On top of all of this, is that there has been no market research done on medicinal marijuana. As a business, I would want to know my potential market and the risks before plunging, at minimum, $210,000 into starting a business. No one knows how many patients will be eligible for this program. How many have sought medical marijuana. Et cetera. But, wait! There's just a little more burden to throw on top of the business owners. You aren't allowed to sell just plain old marijuana! Or edibles. The bill states that only processed oils and tinctures (paraphrasing) are allowed to be sold. Now you've just turned into a marijuana chemist as well. So not only are you out $10K just for asking and then $200K to try and then a lot more than that to just grow marijuana on a commercial scale. Now you get to figure out how to process this marijuana into specialized products afterwards! GOOD LUCK to your bottom line. Oh yea, you get to spend $10K each year thereafter to re-register. With no guarantee that you'll be re-accepted. ::whew:: Are you ready to invest boys! Line'em up!!!

And of course, the high intro costs will lead to only rich people controlling the marijuana growing industry here. That creates another future problem. What if people in Pennsylvania realized, like they should, that legal marijuana is a better alternative than illegal marijuana? (In all facets: higher tax revenue, less people in prison, less police expenditures, so on) Well, hold on a minute! There are at least ~~25~~ 50 very rich people/organizations that are making a lot of money from being the sole proprietors of growing marijuana. (I'm not even counting the dispensaries) Do you think they want sick people growing their OWN marijuana? Do you think they want anyone to be able to grow their own marijuana? Now you have ~~25~~ 50 very rich lobbyists that will do damn near anything to kill a legal marijuana initiative. If history is any indicator, that is not going to turn out well for legalization proponents for a long motherfuckin time. And just when you thought all of that wasn't so bad (I hope not. Are you retarded?), the fucking HEALTH DEPARTMENT of PA is in charge of the business side of this debacle. Pricing. Managing the growers/dispensaries. Et cetera. What in the hell do they know about business management? CHIP can't even properly and timely accept payments for my 2 year old daughters health plan!

One of the requirements inherent in the right of free speech is that those that have it also have the responsibility of accepting the consequences of what they say/express using that free speech.

The thing is corporations that expect to do business publicly have to conform to the laws of the land they wish to do business in.  If that land has laws protecting people from discrimination, and your corporation wants to discriminate, they are breaking the law and should face legal action.

Sure, the corporation can bitch and moan about how they hate this group or that group all they want.  Now that is free speach.  But as soon as they start refusing to serve those people based on the ignorance the speak about, the the corporation is discriminating and breaking the fucking laws.

So what these ignorant fucking corporations are having problems with is anti-discrimination laws, not their freedom of speech.

The irony us, if they use their free speech to speak against the people they are wanting to discriminate against, they will get the same results in the end, because most people prefer not to do business with ignorant bigots."

There, representatives of the coup regime were placed on an equal footing with representatives of Zelaya’s constitutional government, and Costa Rican president Oscar Arias (a close U.S. ally) as mediator.  Unsurprisingly, the negotiation process only succeeded in one thing: keeping Zelaya out of office for the rest of his constitutional mandate.  "" http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/09/24/hillary-clinton-emails-and-honduras-coup"

Not only that, the idea that ""the customer is always right"" mentality is the biggest load of shit I have *ever heard* as it makes people just forget that the people they're talking to are people, ergo, learning that those people aren't people, not caring about them, which leads to ""they're just lazy and that's why they have a job like that"", and you have nobody on your side, it's hard to keep going. 

Honestly, this country is lucky that it's as stable as it is now, because with the way most of us feel, we all could literally say, ""fuck work, fuck bills, let's save my humanity"", all join together, and just fucking *go* downtown, or to our respective state capitals, and just *protest*. 

but that would never happen, because we are all living in fear of not being able to pay rent, and some people literally are so blind to the horrible system they live in that they'll complain all day about it, but do nothing and then vote for the party that shafted them in the first place. 

It's like, why keep going? What incentive do I have to do anything? 

There are two classes: The ruling class, and the working class. 

And of the working class, there are so many niches that people buy into, so we don't go after the ruling class and instead fight amongst each other. "

Outsourcing is taking work out of the country and in many cases degrades quality of the work. 

But for Automation, realistically, if the job can be done cheaper by a machine than a person, without the loss of quality, then the only thing keeping them from doing that is a sense that those people 'need the work'. As if they were obligated to hire people just because people need to work. 

Its sad to say, but im kinda of the opinion that we shouldn't be hanging on to less efficient methods just for the sake of giving someone a job. Now, if the person can still do that work with better quality, then yes, there is justification for not automating it. 

The side issue here is, the minimum wage has been stagnant for so long, that everyone demanding a sudden jump in it could cause a major imbalance in wages. Suddenly cashiers and burger flippers are making as much as entry level professional (ie degree requiring) jobs, which could prompt that level to demand a wage that would justify the time (and massive cost) it took to get that degree to do that job. 

And that is presuming that the sudden minimum wage spike doesn't also trigger a sudden cost of living hike as well. IT cost more to employ people, so the price of everything goes up, which could effectively nullify the minimum wage hike, and were back at square one.  

This is all theoretical of course, but its one scenario keep imaging with this situation."

WHAT ARE the main issues in this contract fight?

THERE ARE a lot of issues that we've been bargaining concessions over the past several contracts. Verizon is attacking our medical, our pensions, disability, overtime--all of our compensation is under attack.

What's different about this contract is that they're attempting to destroy Article 8, which protects our right to show up to work in the same place, every day, a reasonable distance from where we live.

They're pushing to change transfer rights to favor the company to the point that they will be able to transfer us anywhere in the company footprint for up two months at a time, during which we'd live in hotels away from our families and communities.

There's also been an erosion of call center work and an increase in contracting out, and this contract would allow for closing more call centers and transferring members up to 80 miles from their current job sites, as well as opening the door to increased international outsourcing.

IS JOB security also a major issue?

WE CURRENTLY have two tiers of job security. For people hired before 2003, we have essentially ironclad job security. People retire of their own volition or take an incentivized buyout. For people hired after 2003, it's much easier to be laid off, which we've seen in New York City, where it's very hard to find anybody working on the technical side with less than 15 years on the job.

For this contract, they'd like to eliminate job security across the board, no matter how long you've been in the company.

VERIZON HAS made $39 billion in profits over the last three years. They don't seem to need concessions in order to survive. What do you think are the company's goals with these contract demands?

THEY'RE TRYING to streamline their operations. They're transforming the company to be more oriented on Wireless, and they'd like the wireline side to be more flexible and modeled more on the workplace culture of Wireless, which is still overwhelmingly non-union.

The issue with the transfers is that as the company replaces the 100-year-old copper-based network with the fiber-optic network that carries their FIOS product, they need short-term, high-intensity workforces to build the network, and then move on to the next build.

So their vision is a migrant workforce that follows the work from state to state. Obviously, this model favors younger workers who are not tied down and have much lower expectations for how they should be treated within the company.

THE CONTRACT expired last August. Why have things come to a head now?

I THINK it's become clear now that the company has drawn a line in the sand, and they're not going to shift without a major action on our part. They've essentially stuck to their proposals since August, and even though the union volunteered $200 million in concessions in the late winter, the company wasn't interested at all.

The company made noises that this was its last best offer on medical and other major issues, and in a situation where the union and the company can't agree to terms on specific articles, the company has the power to impose its version of the settlement.

So the stakes are very high. If the union accepts this horrible transfer concession, it's going to spell the death of the union. Too many of us are older and have established families and roots in our communities to pick up and leave for two months at a time. This is a make-or-break issue for the union.

THE CWA is the biggest union to endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the strike will be happening while the Democratic candidates are competing in the New York primary. Is that a coincidence?

THE UNION is looking to use the Sanders campaign to highlight everything that's wrong with Verizon. Verizon maps perfectly with everything that Bernie's campaign has said about the 1 Percent and Wall Street's greed and transferring wealth and control from workers to bosses. So this is a real boon for the union that the class anger that's boiled for years under the surface is being exposed and validated by the Sanders campaign.

This is a critical week because of the New York primary, and the union will be participating in various Sanders events. CWA President Chris Shelton will be introducing Bernie at a rally on Wednesday in NYC, and numerous local rallies will be happening around the primary to build a connection that this is bigger than Verizon.

But winning at Verizon would be a good first step in the kind of political revolution people want to see Sanders bring.

WHAT DO you think it will take for the union to win a strike?

I THINK it's a scary prospect to be on strike right now. This can be a protracted and brutal strike. I think the union will have to look very strategically at how we're building community support, which it's already begun to do around issues of the digital divide.

There are glaring holes in the FIOS network that has replicated the lack of access that predominantly Black and immigrant low-income neighborhoods already suffer from.

But the heart of this strike has to be militant participation by the union membership. Because the company is so focused on finishing FIOS builds in high-density, high-income areas like Manhattan, stopping scab operations should be the forefront of the union strategy.

WHY SHOULD people support Verizon workers, and what can they do to help?

LIKE I said before, Verizon could be the poster child of corporate greed. It's not just about money, it's about companies that pay no taxes getting to dictate your life outside of work as well--that you won't get to see your families for two months. They want to change the overtime rules so that you have a seven-day workweek and never get two days off in a row.

Then there's the issue of high-speed Internet access--it's ridiculous that anybody lacks high-speed Internet in their home in the wealthiest country in the world.

People can support us by showing up to picket lines and rallies, by stopping automatic bill pay [if they have a Verizon account] and wearing buttons in support of the union--and by organizing a union in their own workplace!"

No, he doesn't. I understand that the families are upset and what they went through nobody should ever have to, but you can't blame Sanders for it.

Adam Lanza is the one to blame here, but he killed himself to prevent being held responsible for his actions. It could be argued that his mother was to blame for not locking the weapons away to prevent her mentally unstable son from reaching them, but she also paid the ultimate price for not doing so.

After this tragedy, there was legislation introduced to reinstate the Assault weapons ban, Sanders voted Yes. Had he not voted yes then I could understand some resentment and an apology. 

I'm sorry to say, Mrs. Smegielski, but you should seek an apology from the 44 Republicans, 15 Democrats, and 1 Independent who voted against the legislation. Not one of the forty who stood for it."

You want to know who is that person? 

The maniac who shot your kid. And he's dead. 

Maybe we do need tighter gun control, background checks, access to mental healthcare, yadda yadda yadda. I understand that. But you can't just ignore the constitution and ignore the needs of people in rural states. Bernie Sanders is a senator for Vermont. When he voted against that bill he was representing the people of Vermont. Should they all apologize also? Should the governor of Vermont apologize? 

Where does this end? 

Bernie Sanders has a fucking D from the NRA. He's tougher on gun control then pretty much every republican running right now. Even many democrats. 

But that's not even the main thing that pisses me off about this, what really pisses me off is Clinton using dead children to attack Sanders. 

Fuck her. What happened in Sandy Hook happened for a lot of reasons. But you want to know perhaps the major reason? The dehumanization and personal alienation caused by neoliberalism and consumer culture. Two things people like Clinton are highly in favor of. Should she apologize too?

Or are we still doing this thing where we pretend that guy somehow came out of a vacuum? He called into a radio show once and compared himself to Travis the chimp (chimp who mauled his friend's owner). Namely like somebody being forced to live an unnatural and absurd existence in a society that doesn't care about them. 

Maybe I'm wrong for treating Adam Lanza like a human being, but why the fuck is that aspect, something that crops up whenever these kinds of shootings happen, never talked about? 

 I don't bring that up to attack Clinton but to pinpoint the hypocrisy of this entire argument. The shallowness and stupidity of it. What happened in Sandy Hook was everyone's fault, it was our whole culture's fault.

You really want to stop this shit? Look inwards. Don't get pissed at Bernie Sanders for doing his fucking job.

Violence against the police only makes people STOP liking you.  You can get your message heard these days, thanks to mass media and social media, so easily.  But, there is also the side-effect that all the douchey stuff you do becomes noticeable too, on both sides, right away.

Seriously, if any of you are planning on protesting, do it peacefully.  Don't turn into one of those mentally challenged protesters, ""But you're a white male!"" as you scream in someone's face that they can't possibly relate because of that.  As soon as you start blocking ambulances and throwing stuff at police, I instantly think you are a scummy person of low intellectual capacity.

Seriously, think about it for a second, what does blocking an ambulance on the street actually do.  What is the purpose of your protest.  Do you think people are going to become enlightened to your message and flock to you and be inspired by you by doing that?  Now, I assume most of you reading this are reasonably intelligent people to agree with this idea that ya, that is dumb.  But you see, that is why I think I am completely justified in questioning the intellectual capacity of morons that do things like that because they lack so much self-awareness as to not realize the stupidity of it all.  It can't just be mob-mentality.  It can't just be brainwashing.  Brainwashing happens, but a smart person will at least approach and follow the cause in some meaningful and intelligent way...

TL;DR - Protests are fine, just don't be stupid.  It doesn't help your cause, it only hurts it. DON'T BE STUPID!"

Way way way way way way fucking WAY more people, and growing all the time, and increasingly scarce resources.  We always want to invent a story where we have control over things, but we are to a large extent barking up the wrong tree.

This is the problem with WaPo and other MSM outlets today. It's not that they are knocking Sanders' message in particular, it's that they are strongly implying that anything other than a strategy of change that operates *within* the status quo is completely absurd. It's the constant defeatism and uninspiring approval of the truly meager progress being made that shifts focus away from the biggest problems in today's political landscape, which *are* structural and pervasive, not specific and discrete. How can anyone possibly endorse the system as it works today? What has been done by recent US governments that anyone can look at and **really** be proud of?

The rise of both Sanders *and* Trump is showing us that people are *not* happy with status quo politics or politicians. That the majority of people want *drastic* change, not faux pragmatism that is really leading us nowhere fast. The fact that the media is doing more to instill complacency than shine light on the problems that millions of people are already realizing without their help is not only depressing, it's scary."

&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;LeBretton said a representative for the Obama administration then asked New Balance to accept a compromise version of the trade deal, **partly** in exchange for a pledge of help getting the Department the Defense to expedite the purchase of US-made shoes.

""Partly""? This allegation needs to be a lot more specific to be taken at all seriously. Who exactly is he claiming promised something and who did they promise it to? Does ""partly"" mean the linkage between the trade deal and the military bidding process was inferred? As he also mentions a ""compromise version of the trade deal"" being discussed was this a USTR rep running some potential trade deal changes by someone from the company who was serving on one of the advisory committees? Finally, LeBretton says nothing about anyone being asked not to ""bad-mouth"" the deal -- where does that allegation come from?

&gt;The presidential campaign for Democrat Hillary Clinton is hosting a number of fundraisers overseas in the coming weeks, despite past issues with money from foreign donors.


&gt;This Friday, while her opponent Bernie Sanders is in the Vatican discussing global poverty with the presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador among others, ex-Goldman Sachs partner Gary Gensler will host a fundraiser for Clinton in Hong Kong.


&gt;That will follow his Wednesday event in Beijing, China looking for campaign cash.

&gt; Among large, profitable entities, 19.5 percent paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2012, said the report, which came at the behest of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, whose campaign circulated the study.

Maybe this is why Verizon had a negative 2.8% effective income tax rate for 2008-2012, while simultaneously claiming they can't afford to provide their employees with reasonable benefits.

&gt; That $1.8 billion in relief from Goldman that's supposed to help homeowners in distress? Miller says that in these cases, the terms are kept vague, and Goldman can use that money to do things that are in its best interest anyway, like writing off debt that's obviously not going to be repaid, demolish foreclosed upon houses, and modify mortgages that are in distress.

&gt;""It would be like me agreeing to be right handed all day today or to wake up tomorrow morning and have coffee,"" Miller says of the settlement agreements. ""Those things are going to happen anyway.""

&gt;He also pointed to something critics have called the ""bullshit-to-cash ratio"" as one indicator of how little the penalty will affect a giant like Goldman. Basically, it's important to note that only about $3 billion of the $5 billion will be paid out in cash. On the other hand, about half is tax-deductible and will be placed on the backs of taxpayers––even though the median American family lost about 40 percent of their wealth during the worst stretch of the crisis.

&gt;What's more, the New York Times notes that after incentives and tax credits, Goldman can chop about a billion dollars off the total penalty. According to a chart attached to the settlement, for every dollar Goldman puts into community investment in New York, they get a $2 tax credit."

"7146","1460558485","Banking Execs: #Too Big Too Jail"
"7147","1460564042","One thing I have never understood is HRC's slogan that she loves to say:

&gt;No bank is too big to fail, no executive too power to jail

Maybe someone can explain to me what that means.  Like when she says ""no bank is too big to fail"" does she not understand what that concept means?  She says it like she is trying to get people riled up about how anti-banking/anti-Wall Street she is...but that is not what too-big-too-fail really has to do with.  Too big to fail is just a concept that certain financial institutions are so interconnected with the rest of our economy that their failure represents a systemic risk that could cause a major, likely global financial collapse.  So when she says that is she saying she does not currently believe any SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) exist?  That seems more like pro-banking sentiment and basically claiming:

&gt;Yeah the banks as they are now on Wall Street are totally fine and do not require legislation

Maybe she is right about this but it seems odd to say it the way she says it and then juxtapose that sentiment with

&gt;But I am totally willing to throw anyone in jail in the banking industry

Like they certainly are not necessarily related statements.  But it is a weird slogan comprising two kind of different view points.  It is also weird for a few other reasons:

1)  Clinton voted for the TARP funding that was used to bail out the banks after the 2007 financial crisis.  So clearly in that case she believed they were too-big-too-fail, right?  So when she says that slogan she means it in a specific sense I guess? Like, ""well right NOW they are too big to fail.""  But honestly it seems like she means it more categorically which is contrary to her support for TARP.  But even if she did mean it specifically now it still does not make sense because 3 banks are BIGGER now than they were prior to 2008.  So if she thought they were too big then how are they not too big now?

2) If she believes no executive is too powerful to jail, how does she feel about the fact that none were jailed in the sub-prime mortgage crisis? Does not seem like she has spoken out against it.  But if she does believe they should have been jailed, then why does she constantly claim that all the money Obama took from Wall Street did not influence him?  If she was all about jailing them and Obama did not jail them, should not she be questioning his motives?  Rather than defending him as the ""Candidate who took the most money from Wall Street in history yet was not corrupted by it.""

If anything, he ran to the *right* of Hillary on some issues, such as his rejection of the individual mandate.

Even today both of Virginia's senators are Democrats while New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and Colorado have 1 Republican and 1 Democrat as senators. Sanders is writing off a major chunk of the Democratic party which is bad politics (duh) and also makes it harder for Democrats to do well in those areas in the future. Unfortunately for Sanders the race isn't entirely out of the South yet. Maryland and Kentucky were below the mason-dixon line and they still have yet to vote, I would be surprised if he won either.

Furthermore,  Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, Alaska, etc. are all darker red than the ""Deep South"" states Bernie is trying to dismiss.

For example in New York a candidate winning by 10 points equates to the delegate difference Sanders got in his 59 point blow out in Utah.  

Wyoming itself being a 7 7 split, and we aren't counting supers since they can change their mind, is that if I understand it correctly they are rationed out through a mix of popular vote and then by congressional districts.  but even if you go by the straight popular vote it'd be an 8 to 6 split.

I see people, the media and the mass of online platforms (many breeding grounds of Trump or Sanders supporters from what I can see) spewing and churning out ill thought out nonsense constantly. There is a lack of nuance to opinions, there is a clear lack of shade between the black and white, there is no focus on vetting the detail of proposals and plans - its simply good v bad, an angel v the devil... SPIN SPIN SPIN. Publish post from here, share post from here, send out blog from here... all treated as gospel!


I had a recent discussion, my first in fact with a Sanders supporter regarding the whole pope situation. When linked directly to the various press releases that clarify the situation, the clarify the role of the conference, that demonstrate the Pope did not extend the invitation nor will he even be here I might as well have been branded a witch for the torrent of abuse the came as a result was insane.


Broadcasts such as the one shown from MSNBC re Wyoming do nothing to help educate or inform the general public - they mislead and obscure the facts. In this particular article concerning rigged elections... theres a clear misunderstanding to begin with about what an election is. An 'election' the primaries are not! And here re Wyoming Delegates tied 7/7... clearly these are issued at a lower level than the 56/44 figure they keep parroting and some areas are more delegate rich meaning you can win less but come out with more or in this case equal.


Then super-delegates. Clearly this system is there to prevent a catastrophe like Trump from being the nominee. If I was a US republican right now I would kill for some superdelegates!! If the system as pro-ported benefits Clinton then why did it not in 2008? Clearly super-delegates will do what is in the interest of the party... and right now Hillary Clinton is winning by significant margins. Why would they back the runner up? Yes he has won the last however many open primaries and caucus states. That does not mean he is winning. 


Perhaps what is a more reasoned argument is that superdelegates should simply not be awarded until or in the run up to convention time where they can fulfill their purpose and not have an early impact on voter perceptions. Perhaps the caucus system, which you could argue has unfairly favoured Sanders, needs removing. I could go on. And so could all of you.


My concern is the way in which you could go on however!! Attacks, digs, ignorance to reason are not ways to bring people on board - you are just pissing each other off and bashing away at your keyboards.


Stop. Just sit for a moment. I dare you. Just sit and objectively look at the numbers for christ sake! Challenge yourself to check any news for yourself. Question what you read. Second guess what you hear. Consider carefully what not only your opposing candidate(s) say - but your own. Don't repeat without something being your own justified and validated opinion. Dream big, aim high and be sure to consider for yourself the facts - the entire message and core of the sanders campaign it appears to me is getting lost in a sea of negative supporters and populist spin.


Anyway. I don't mean to ruffle any feathers and have no political loyalties - just my two cents worth as a frustrated and slightly obsessed observer from the UK!

"7381","1460563663","This article is complete horseshit. Form 990s only tend to include compensation data for the top paying executives. Not only is this a horrible analytical snapshot of a huge organization, the author is trying to compare apples and elephants by saying all executives are the same, except for gender....The median top investment executive for foundations makes 2-3x what a top communications executive makes for example. 

Source: I do staff and executive compensation consulting for foundations...."
"7382","1460517248","So - aside from the obvious issue - lets evaluate this.

""On average, top male executives at the foundation earn $109,000 more than the top female executives with positions in the C-suite.""

Math x= female salary, y=male salary

y = $109,000 + x = x(1.38) 

x = $286,842

y = $395,842

I wonder how much more actual charity the Clinton Foundation could do if it wasn't paying its execs between $285,000 - $400,000 (or potentially a lot more)."

"7389","1460553875","The Clinton Foundation only has about 2,000 employees and operates in dozens of countries. That's far too few people to compare to one another by several orders of magnitude. Any such comparison would rely on comparing a handful of people with wildly different levels of experience and qualifications to one another, comparing people performing completely different job functions, or comparing the compensation of people working in different countries. There's a reason why research in this area is conducted in entire *industries* (in the same country) and not individual organizations (unless they are giant conglomerates with many similar positions that allow for comparisons). You need a population large enough to support statistically valid sample sizes and 2,000 isn't even close."
